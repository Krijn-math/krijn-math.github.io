        "abstract": "We provide the first attribute based encryption (ABE) scheme for Turing machines supporting unbounded collusions from lattice assumptions. In more detail, the encryptor encodes an attribute $\\mathbf{x}$ together with a bound $t$ on the machine running time and a message $m$ into the ciphertext, the key generator embeds a Turing machine $M$ into the secret key and decryption returns $m$ if and only if $M(\\mathbf{x})=1$. Crucially, the input $\\mathbf{x}$ and machine $M$ can be of unbounded size, the time bound $t$ can be chosen dynamically for each input and decryption runs in input specific time. \r\n    \r\nPreviously the best known ABE for uniform computation supported only non-deterministic log space Turing machines (${\\sf NL})$ from pairings (Lin and Luo, Eurocrypt 2020). In the post-quantum regime, the state of the art supports non-deterministic finite automata from LWE in the $\\textit{ symmetric}$ key setting (Agrawal, Maitra and Yamada, Crypto 2019). \r\n\r\nIn more detail, our results are:\r\n\r\n1. We construct the first ABE for ${\\sf NL}$ from the LWE, evasive LWE (Wee, Eurocrypt 2022 and Tsabary, Crypto 2022) and Tensor LWE (Wee, Eurocrypt 2022) assumptions. This yields the first (conjectured) post-quantum ABE for ${\\sf NL}$. \r\n 2. Relying on LWE, evasive LWE and a new assumption called $\\textit{circular tensor}$ LWE, we construct ABE for all Turing machines. At a high level, the circular tensor LWE assumption incorporates circularity into the tensor LWE (Wee, Eurocrypt 2022) assumption.\r\n\r\nTowards our ABE for Turing machines, we obtain the first CP-ABE for circuits of unbounded depth and size from the same assumptions -- this may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "We propose an e-voting protocol based on a novel linkable ring signature scheme with unconditional anonymity. In our system, all voters create private credentials and register their public counterparts. To vote, they create a ring (anonymity set) consisting of public credentials together with a proof of knowledge of their secret credential via our signature. Its unconditional anonymity prevents an attacker, no matter how powerful, from deducing the identity of the voter, thus attaining everlasting privacy. Additionally, our protocol provides coercion resistance in the JCJ framework; when an adversary tries to coerce a voter, the attack can be evaded by creating a signature with a fake but indistinguishable credential. During a moment of privacy, they will cast their real vote. Our scheme also provides verifiability and ballot secrecy.",

    "abstract": "In classical DNSSEC, a drop-in replacement with quantum-safe cryptography would increase DNS query resolution times by $\\textit{at least}$ a factor of $2\\times$. Since a DNS response containing large post-quantum signatures is likely to get marked truncated ($\\texttt{TC}$) by a nameserver (resulting in a wasted UDP round-trip), the client (here, the resolver) would have to retry its query over TCP, further incurring a $\\textit{minimum}$ of two round-trips due to the three-way TCP handshake.\r\n\r\nWe present $\\mathsf{TurboDNS}$: a backward-compatible protocol that eliminates $\\textit{two}$ round-trips from the preceding flow by 1) sending TCP handshake data in the initial DNS/UDP flight itself, and 2) immediately streaming the DNS response over TCP after authenticating the client with a cryptographic cookie. Our experiments show that DNSSEC over $\\mathsf{TurboDNS}$, with either Falcon-512 or Dilithium-2 as the zone signing algorithm, is practically as fast as the currently deployed ECDSA P-256 and RSA-2048 setups in resolving $\\texttt{QTYPE}$ $\\texttt{A}$ DNS queries.",

    "abstract": "Secure multi-party computation (MPC) is a crucial tool for privacy-preserving computation, but it is getting increasingly complicated due to recent advancements and optimizations. Programming tools for MPC allow programmers to develop MPC applications without mastering all cryptography. However, most existing MPC programming tools fail to attract real users due to the lack of documentation, maintenance, and the ability to compose with legacy codebases. In this work, we build Smaug, a modular extension of LLVM. Smaug seamlessly brings all LLVM support to MPC programmers, including error messaging, documentation, code optimization, and frontend support to compile from various languages to LLVM intermediate representation (IR). Smaug can efficiently convert non-oblivious LLVM IR to their oblivious counterparts while applying popular optimizations as LLVM code transformations. With benchmarks written in C++ and Rust and backends for Yao and GMW protocols, we observe that Smaug performs as well as (and sometimes much better than) prior tools using domain-specific languages with similar backends. Finally, we use Smaug to compile open-source projects that\r\nimplement Minesweeper and Blackjack, producing usable two-party games with ease.",

    "abstract": "Cryptocurrency practices worldwide are seen as innovative, yet they navigate a fragmented regulatory environment. Many local authorities aim to balance promoting innovation, safeguarding consumers, and managing potential threats. In particular, it is unclear how people deal with cryptocurrencies in the regions where trading or mining is prohibited. This insight is crucial in conveying the risk reduction strategies. To address this, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 28 cryptocurrency traders and miners from Bangladesh, where the local authority is hostile towards cryptocurrencies. Our research revealed that the participants use unique strategies to mitigate risks around cryptocurrencies. Our findings indicate a prevalent uncertainty at both personal and organizational levels concerning the interpretation of laws, a situation worsened by the actions of the major financial service providers who indirectly facilitate cryptocurrency transactions. We further connect our findings to the broader issues in HCI regarding folk models, informal market and legality, and education and awareness.",

    "abstract": "This survey provides a comprehensive examination of verifiable computing, tracing its evolution from foundational complexity theory to modern zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (ZK-SNARKs). We explore key developments in interactive proof systems, knowledge complexity, and the application of low-degree polynomials in error detection and verification protocols. The survey delves into essential mathematical frameworks such as the Cook-Levin Theorem, the sum-check protocol, and the GKR protocol, highlighting their roles in enhancing verification efficiency and soundness. By systematically addressing the limitations of traditional NP-based proof systems and then introducing advanced interactive proof mechanisms to overcome them, this work offers an accessible step-by-step introduction for newcomers while providing detailed mathematical analyses for researchers. Ultimately, we synthesize these concepts to elucidate the GKR protocol, which serves as a foundation for contemporary verifiable computing models. This survey not only reviews the historical and theoretical advancements in verifiable computing over the past three decades but also lays the groundwork for understanding recent innovations in the field.",

Beyond these applications, the paper makes two key contributions: the introduction of a novel cheater identification algorithm designed to verify the correct submission of shares during secret reconstruction, and empirical validation through experimental studies to support the theoretical advancements. This multifaceted approach not only demonstrates the versatility of SBIoT but also proposes innovative mechanisms to enhance security and integrity, contributing to the development of a more robust cryptographic framework.\r\nThis article expands upon the work presented in the poster \"A Combinatorial Approach to IoT Data Security\" at IWSEC 2023, Yokohama, Japan.",

    "abstract": "Side-channel analysis (SCA) does not aim at the algorithm's weaknesses but rather its implementations. The rise of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) is giving adversaries advanced capabilities to perform stealthy attacks. In this paper, we propose DL-SCADS, a DL-based approach along with signal decomposition techniques to leverage the power of secret key extraction from post-silicon EM/power side-channel traces. We integrate previously proven effective ideas of model ensembling and automated hyperparameter tuning with signal decomposition to develop an efficient and robust side-channel attack. Extensive experiments are performed on Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. The evaluation of the performance of the side-channel attack employing various decomposition techniques and comparison with the proposed approach in a range of datasets are also tabulated.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to calculating the Levenshtein (edit) distance within the framework of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), specifically targeting third-generation schemes like TFHE. Edit distance computations are essential in applications across finance and genomics, such as DNA sequence alignment. We introduce an optimised algorithm that significantly reduces the cost of edit distance calculations called Leuvenshtein. This algorithm specifically reduces the number of programmable bootstraps (PBS) needed per cell of the calculation, lowering it from approximately 28 operations\u2014required by the conventional Wagner-Fisher algorithm\u2014to just 1. Additionally, we propose an efficient method for performing equality checks on characters, reducing ASCII character comparisons to only 2 PBS operations. Finally, we explore the potential for further performance improvements by utilizing preprocessing when one of the input strings is unencrypted. Our Leuvenshtein achieves up to $205\\times$ faster performance compared to the best available TFHE implementation and up to $39\\times$ faster than an optimised implementation of the Wagner-Fisher algorithm. Moreover, when offline preprocessing is possible due to the presence of one unencrypted input on the server side, an additional $3\\times$ speedup can be achieved.",

By employing DWTs, the protocols significantly reduce the overhead typically associated with Lookup Table-style (LUT) evaluations in MPC. We state and prove foundational results for DWT-compressed LUTs in MPC, present protocols for 9 of the most common activation functions used in ML, and experimentally evaluate the performance of our protocols for large domain sizes in the LAN and WAN settings. Our protocols are extremely fast -- for instance, when considering 64-bit inputs, computing 1000 parallel instances of the sigmoid function, with an error less than $2^{-24}$ takes only a few hundred milliseconds incurs just 29\\,KiB of online communication (40 bytes per evaluation).",

    "abstract": "The Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU), a standard feature in all modern computing systems, presents significant security risks by leaking sensitive user activities through microarchitectural event data. This work demonstrates the feasibility of remote side-channel attacks leveraging PMU data, revealing vulnerabilities that compromise user privacy and enable covert surveillance without physical access to the target machine. By analyzing the PMU feature space, we create distinct micro-architectural fingerprints for benchmark applications, which are then utilized in machine learning (ML) models to detect the corresponding benchmarks. This approach allows us to build a pre-trained model for benchmark detection using the unique micro-architectural fingerprints derived from PMU data. Subsequently, when an attacker remotely accesses the victim\u2019s PMU data, the pre-trained model enables the identification of applications used by the victim with high accuracy. In our proof-of-concept demonstration, the pre-trained model successfully identifies applications used by a victim when the attacker remotely accesses PMU data, showcasing the potential for malicious exploitation of PMU data. We analyze stress-ng benchmarks and build our classifiers using logistic regression, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest ML models. Our proposed models achieve an average prediction accuracy of 98%, underscoring the potential risks associated with remote side-channel analysis using PMU data and emphasizing the need for more robust safeguards. This work underscores the urgent need for robust countermeasures to protect against such vulnerabilities and provides a foundation for future research in micro-architectural security.",

    "abstract": "Index Calculus (IC) algorithm is the most effective probabilistic algorithm for solving discrete logarithms over finite fields of prime numbers, and it has been widely applied to cryptosystems based on elliptic curves. Since the IC algorithm was proposed in 1920, the research on it has never stopped, especially discretization of prime numbers on the finite fields, both the algorithm itself and its application have been greatly developed. Of course, there has been some research on elliptic curves,but with little success. For the IC algorithm, scholars pay more attention to how to improve the probability of solving and reduce the time complexity of calculation. It is the first time for the IICA to study the optimization problem of the IC by using the method of integer. However, the IICA only studies the case of integer up, and fails to consider the case of integer down. It is found that the integer direction of the IICA can be integer up or integer down, but the concept of modular multiplication needs to be used when integer down. After optimizing the IICA, the probability of successful solution of discrete logarithm is increased by nearly 2 times, and the number of transformations is also reduced to a certain extent, thus reducing the time complexity of solution. The re-optimized the IC algorithm greatly improves the probability of successful the IC solution. This research result poses a serious challenge to cryptosystems based on finite fields of prime numbers.",

    "abstract": "Internet-scale consensus protocols used by blockchains are designed to remain operational in the presence of unexpected temporary crash faults (the so-called sleepy model of consensus) -- a critical feature for the latency-sensitive financial applications running on these systems. \r\nHowever, their leader-based architecture, where a single block proposer is responsible for creating the block at each height, makes them vulnerable to short-term censorship attacks, in which the proposers profit at the application layer by excluding certain transactions. \r\nIn this work, we introduce an atomic broadcast protocol, secure in the sleepy model, that ensures the inclusion of all transactions within a constant expected time, provided that at least one participating node is non-censoring at all times. \r\nUnlike traditional approaches, our protocol avoids designating a single proposer per block height, instead leveraging a so-called dynamically available common subset (DACS) protocol -- the first of its kind in the sleepy model. Additionally, our construction guarantees deterministic synchronization -- once an honest node confirms a block, all other honest nodes do so within a constant time, thus addressing a shortcoming of many low-latency sleepy protocols.",

    "abstract": "This paper improves upon the quantum circuits required for the Shor's attack on binary elliptic curves. We present two types of quantum point addition, taking both qubit count and circuit depth into consideration. \r\n\r\nIn summary, we propose an in-place point addition that improves upon the work of Banegas et al. from CHES'21, reducing the qubit count \u2013 depth product by more than $73\\%$ \u2013 $81\\%$ depending on the variant. Furthermore, we develop an out-of-place point addition by using additional qubits. This method achieves the lowest circuit depth and offers an improvement of over $92\\%$ in the qubit count \u2013 quantum depth product (for a single step).\r\n\r\nTo the best of our knowledge, our work improves from all previous works (including the CHES'21 paper by Banegas et al., the IEEE Access'22 paper by Putranto et al., and the CT-RSA'23 paper by Taguchi and Takayasu) in terms of circuit depth and qubit count \u2013 depth product. \r\n\r\nEquipped with the implementations, we discuss the post-quantum security of the binary elliptic curve cryptography. Under the MAXDEPTH metric (proposed by the US government's NIST), the quantum circuit with the highest depth in our work is $2^{24}$, which is significantly lower than the MAXDEPTH limit of $2^{40}$. For the gate count \u2013 full depth product, a metric for estimating quantum attack cost (proposed by NIST), the highest complexity in our work is $2^{60}$ for the curve having degree 571 (which is comparable to AES-256 in terms of classical security), considerably below the post-quantum security level 1 threshold (of the order of $2^{156}$).",

    "abstract": "Cryptography based on the presumed hardness of decoding codes -- i.e., code-based cryptography -- has recently seen increased interest due to its plausible security against quantum attackers. Notably, of the four proposals for the NIST post-quantum standardization process that were advanced to their fourth round for further review, two were code-based. The most efficient proposals -- including HQC and BIKE, the NIST submissions alluded to above -- in fact rely on the presumed hardness of decoding structured codes. Of particular relevance to our work, HQC is based on quasi-cyclic codes, which are codes generated by matrices consisting of two cyclic blocks.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the security analysis of HQC requires a precise understanding of the Decryption Failure Rate (DFR), whose analysis relies on the following heuristic: given random \"sparse\" vectors $e_1,e_2$ (say, each coordinate is i.i.d. Bernoulli) multiplied by fixed \"sparse\" quasi-cyclic matrices $A_1,A_2$, the weight of resulting vector $e_1A_1+e_2A_2$ is very concentrated around its expectation. In the documentation, the authors model the distribution of $e_1A_1+e_2A_2$ as a vector with independent coordinates (and correct marginal distribution). However, we uncover cases where this modeling fails. While this does not invalidate the (empirically verified) heuristic that the weight of $e_1A_1+e_2A_2$ is concentrated, it does suggest that the behavior of the noise is a bit more subtle than previously predicted. Lastly, we also discuss implications of our result for potential worst-case to average-case reductions for quasi-cyclic codes.",

    "abstract": "Today, many auctions are carried out with the help of intermediary platforms like Google and eBay. These platforms serve as a  rendezvous point for the buyers and sellers, and charge a fee for its service. We refer to such auctions as platform-assisted auctions. Traditionally, the auction theory literature mainly focuses on designing auctions that incentivize the buyers to bid truthfully, assuming that the platform always faithfully implements the auction. In practice, however, the platforms have been found to   manipulate the auctions to earn more profit, resulting in high-profile anti-trust lawsuits. \r\n\r\nWe propose a new model  for studying platform-assisted  auctions in the permissionless setting, where anyone can register and participate in the auction. We explore whether it is possible to design a dream auction in this new model, such that honest behavior  is the utility-maximizing strategy for each individual buyer, the platform, the seller, as well as platform-seller or platform-buyer coalitions. Through a collection of feasibility and infeasibility results, we carefully characterize the mathematical landscape of platform-assisted auctions. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, our work reveals exciting connections between cryptography and mechanism design. We show how cryptography can lend to the design of an efficient platform-assisted auction with dream properties. Although a line of works have also used multi-party computation (MPC) or the blockchain to remove the reliance on a trusted auctioneer, our work is distinct in nature in several dimensions. First, we initiate a systematic exploration of  the game theoretic implications when the service providers (e.g., nodes that implement the MPC or blockchain protocol) are strategic and can collude with sellers or buyers.  Second,  we observe that the full simulation paradigm used in the standard MPC literature is too stringent and leads to high asymptotical costs. Specifically,  because every player has a different private outcome in an auction protocol, to the best of our knowledge, running any generic MPC  protocol among the players would incur at least $n^2$ total cost  where $n$ is the number of buyers.We propose a new notion of simulation called {\\it utility-dominated emulation} that is sufficient for guaranteeing the game-theoretic properties needed in an auction. Under this new notion of simulation, we show how to design efficient auction protocols with quasilinear efficiency, which gives an $n$-fold improvement over any generic approach.",

    "abstract": "Electromagnetic side-channel analysis is a powerful method for monitoring processor activity and compromising cryptographic systems in air-gapped environments. As analytical methodologies and target devices evolve, the importance of leakage localization and probe aiming becomes increasingly apparent for capturing only the desired signals with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Despite its importance, there remains substantial reliance on unreliable heuristic approaches and inefficient exhaustive searches. Furthermore, related studies often fall short in terms of feasibility, practicality, and performance, and are limited to controlled DUTs and low-end MCUs.\r\n\r\nTo address the limitations and inefficiencies of the previous approaches, we propose a novel methodology\u2015${\\rm P{\\tiny ROBE}S{\\tiny HOOTER}}$\u2015for leakage localization and probe aiming. This approach leverages new insights into the spatial characteristics of amplitude modulation and intermodulation distortion in processors. As a result, ${\\rm P{\\tiny ROBE}S{\\tiny HOOTER}}$ provides substantial improvements in various aspects: $\\boldsymbol 1)$ it is applicable to not only simple MCUs but also complex SoCs, $\\boldsymbol 2)$ it effectively handles multi-core systems and dynamic frequency scaling, $\\boldsymbol 3)$ it is adoptable to uncontrollable DUTs, making it viable for constrained real-world attacks, and $\\boldsymbol 4)$ it performs significantly faster than previous methods. To demonstrate this, we experimentally evaluate ${\\rm P{\\tiny ROBE}S{\\tiny HOOTER}}$ on a high-end MCU (the NXP i.MX RT1061 featuring a single ARM Cortex-M7 core) and a complex SoC (the Broadcom BCM2711 equipped with the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, featuring four ARM Cortex-A72 cores).",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce an oracle version of the Restricted Syndrome Decoding Problem (RSDP) and propose novel authentication protocols based on the hardness of this problem. They follow the basic structure of the HB-family of authentication protocols and later improvements but demonstrate several advantages.\r\nAn appropriate choice of multiplicative subgroup and ring structure gives rise to a very efficient hardware implementation compared to other \\emph{Learning Parity with Noise} based approaches. In addition, the new protocols also have lower key size, lower communication costs, and potentially better completeness/soundness compared to learning-based alternatives. This is appealing in the context of low-cost, low-powered authenticating devices such as radio frequency identification (RFID) systems. \r\nLastly, we show that with additional assumptions, RSDP can be used to instantiate a Man-in-the-Middle secured authentication protocol.",

    "abstract": "Multi-input and large-precision lookup table (LUT) evaluation pose significant challenges in Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). Currently, two modes are employed to address this issue. One is tree-based functional bootstrapping (TFBS), which uses multiple blind rotations to construct a tree for LUT evaluation. The second is circuit bootstrapping, which decomposes all inputs into bits and utilizes a CMux tree for LUT evaluation. In this work, we propose a novel mode that is leveled functional bootstrapping. This mode utilizes the external product tree to perform multi-input functional bootstrapping. We implement TFBS and LFBS within the OpenFHE library. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms TFBS in both computational efficiency and bootstrapping key size. Specifically, for 12-bit and 16-bit input LUTs, our method is approximately two to three orders of magnitude faster than TFBS.\r\nFinally, we introduce a novel scheme-switching framework that supports large-precision polynomial and non-polynomial evaluations. The framework leverages digital extraction techniques to enable seamless switching between the BFV and LFBS schemes.",

Yet, historically such network designs have not been made public, leading to limited formal cryptographic analysis of the security offered by them. One of the few public protocols used in space networking is the Bundle Protocol, which is secured by Bundle Protocol Security (BPSec), an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard. We undertake a first analysis of BPSec under its default security context, building a model of the secure channel security goals stated in the IETF standard, and note issues therein with message loss detection. We prove BPSec secure, and also provide a stronger construction, one that supports the Bundle Protocol's functionality goals while also ensuring destination awareness of missing message components.",

    "abstract": "Secret handshakes, introduced by Balfanz et al. [3], allow users associated with various groups to determine if they share a common affiliation. These protocols ensure crucial properties such as fairness (all participants learn the result simultaneously), affiliation privacy (failed handshakes reveal no affiliation information), and result-hiding (even participants within a shared group cannot infer outcomes of unrelated handshakes). Over time, various secret-handshake schemes have been proposed, with a notable advancement being the modular framework by Tsudik and Xu. Their approach integrates three key components: group signature schemes, centralized secure channels for each group, and decentralized group key-agreement protocols.\r\nBuilding upon this modularity, we propose significant updates. By addressing hidden complexities and revising the security model, we enhance both the efficiency and the privacy guarantees of the protocol. Specifically, we achieve the novel property of Self distinction\u2014the ability to distinguish between two users in a session without revealing their identities\u2014by replacing the group signature primitive with a new construct, the List MAC. This primitive is inherently untraceable, necessitating adjustments to the original syntax to support stronger privacy guarantees. Consequently, we introduce the Traitor Catching paradigm, where the transcript of a handshake reveals only the identity of a traitor, preserving the anonymity of all other participants.\r\nTo showcase the flexibility and robustness of our updated framework, we present two post-quantum instantiations (a hash-based one and another based on lattices). Our approach not only corrects prior limitations but also establishes a new benchmark for privacy and security in secret handshakes.",

    "abstract": "Functional Encryption is a powerful cryptographic primitive that allows for fine-grained access control over encrypted data. In the multi-user setting, especially Multi-Client and Multi-Input, a plethora of works have been proposed to study on concrete function classes, improving security, and more. However, the CCA-security for such schemes is still an open problem, where the only known works are on Public-Key Single-Client FE ($\\mathit{e.g.}$ Benhamouda, Bourse, and Lipmaa, PKC'17).\r\n  This work provides the first generic construction of CCA-secure Multi-Client FE for Inner Products, and Multi-Input FE for Inner Products, with instantiations from $\\mathsf{SXDH}$ and $\\mathsf{DLIN}$ for the former, and $\\mathsf{DDH}$ or $\\mathsf{DCR}$ for the latter. Surprisingly, in the case of secret key MIFE we attain the same efficiency as in the public key single-client setting. In the MCFE setting, a toolkit of CCA-bootstrapping techniques is developed to achieve CCA-security in its $\\mathit{secret~key}$ setting.",

Motivated by its application in the SQIsign post-quantum signature scheme, we provide for the first time a constant time LLL-like algorithm with guarantees on the length of the shortest output vector.

    "abstract": "Two most common ways to design non-interactive zero knowledge (NIZK) proofs are based on Sigma ($\\Sigma$)-protocols (an efficient way to prove algebraic statements) and zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARK) protocols (an efficient way to prove arithmetic statements). However, in the applications of cryptocurrencies such as privacy-preserving credentials, privacy-preserving audits, and  blockchain-based voting systems, the zk-SNARKs for general statements are usually implemented with encryption, commitment, or other algebraic cryptographic schemes. Moreover, zk-SNARKs for many different arithmetic statements may also be required to be implemented together. Clearly, a typical solution is to extend the zk-SNARK circuit to include the code for algebraic part. However, complex cryptographic operations in the algebraic algorithms will significantly increase the circuit size, which leads to impractically large proving time and CRS size. Thus, we need a flexible enough proof system for composite statements including both algebraic and arithmetic statements. Unfortunately, while the conjunction of zk-SNARKs is relatively natural and numerous effective solutions are currently available (e.g. by utilizing the commit-and-prove technique), the disjunction of zk-SNARKs is rarely discussed in detail.\r\n        In this paper, we mainly focus on the disjunctive statements of Groth16, and we propose a Groth16 variant---CompGroth16, which provides a framework for Groth16 to prove the disjunctive statements that consist of a mix of algebraic and arithmetic components. Specifically, we could directly combine CompGroth16 with $\\Sigma$-protocol or even CompGroth16 with CompGroth16 just like the logical composition of $\\Sigma$-protocols. From this, we can gain many good properties, such as broader expression, better prover's efficiency and shorter CRS. In addition, for the combination of CompGroth16 and $\\Sigma$-protocol, we also present two representative application scenarios to demonstrate the practicality of our construction.",

    "abstract": "In recent development of secure multi-party computation (MPC), pseudorandom correlations of subfield vector oblivious linear evaluation (sVOLE) type become popular due to their amazing applicability in multi-dimensional MPC protocols such as privacy-preserving biometric identification and privacy-preserving machine learning protocols. In this paper, we introduce a novel way of VOLE distribution in three-party and four-party honest majority settings with the aid of a trusted server. This new method significantly decreases the communication cost and the memory storage of random sVOLE instances. On the other hand, it also enables a streamline distribution process that can generate a sVOLE instance of an arbitrary length, which results in 100 percent of utility rate of random sVOLE in multi-dimensional MPC protocols while preserving complete precomputability.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we address the problem of Delegated PSI (D-PSI), where a cloud server is introduced to handle most computational and communication tasks. D-PSI enables users to securely delegate their private sets to the cloud, ensuring the privacy of their data while allowing efficient computation of the intersection. The cloud operates under strict security requirements, learning nothing about the individual sets or the intersection result. Moreover, D-PSI minimizes user-to-user communication and supports \"silent\" processing, where the cloud can perform computations independently without user interaction, apart from set delegation and result retrieval.\r\n\r\nWe formally define the D-PSI problem and propose a novel construction that extends beyond two-party scenarios to support multi-party settings. Our construction adheres to the D-PSI requirements, including security against semi-honest adversaries, and achieves computational and communication complexities close to the ideal \"perfect\" D-PSI protocol. Additionally, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach through a baseline implementation and an optimized version that further reduces computational overhead. Our results establish a strong foundation for secure and efficient PSI in real-world cloud computing scenarios.",

    "abstract": "A central question in the theory of cryptography is whether we can build protocols that achieve stronger security guarantees, e.g., security against malicious adversaries,  by combining building blocks that achieve much weaker security guarantees, e.g., security only against semi-honest adversaries; and with the minimal number of rounds. An additional focus is whether these building blocks can be used only as a black-box. Since Oblivious Transfer (OT) is the necessary and sufficient building block to securely realize any two-party (and multi-party) functionality, theoreticians often focus on proving whether maliciously secure OT can be built from a weaker notion of OT.\r\n\r\nThere is a rich body of literature that provides (black-box) compilers that build malicious OT from OTs that achieve weaker security such as semi-malicious OT and defensibly secure OT,  within the minimal number of rounds. However, no round-optimal compiler exists that builds malicious OT from the weakest notion of semi-honest OT, in the plain model.\r\n\r\nCorrelation intractable hash (CIH) functions are special hash functions whose properties allow instantiating the celebrated Fiat-Shamir transform, and hence reduce the round complexity of public-coin proof systems. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we devise the first round-optimal compiler from semi-honest OT to malicious OT, by a novel application of CIH for collapsing rounds in the plain model. We provide the following contributions. First, we provide a new  CIH-based round-collapsing construction for general cut-and-choose. This gadget can be used generally to prove the correctness of the evaluation of a function. Then, we use our gadget to build the first round-optimal compiler from semi-honest OT to malicious OT.\r\n\r\nOur compiler uses the semi-honest OT protocol and the other building blocks in a black-box manner. However,  for technical reasons,  the underlying CIH construction requires the upper bound of the circuit size of the semi-honest OT protocol used. The need for this upper-bound makes our protocol not fully black-box, hence is incomparable with existing, fully black-box, compilers.",

    "abstract": "The server-aided model for multiparty computation (MPC) was introduced to capture a real-world scenario where clients wish to off-load the heavy computation of MPC protocols to dedicated servers. A rich body of work has studied various trade-offs between security guarantees (e.g., semi-honest vs malicious),  trust assumptions (e.g., the threshold on corrupted servers), and efficiency. \r\n\r\nHowever, all existing works make the assumption that all clients must agree on employing the same servers, and accept the same corruption threshold. In this paper, we challenge this assumption and introduce a new paradigm for server-aided MPC, where each client can choose their own set of servers and their own threshold of corrupted servers. In this new model, the privacy of each client is guaranteed as long as their own threshold is satisfied, regardless of the other servers/clients. We call this paradigm per-party private server-aided MPC to highlight both a security and efficiency guarantee: (1) per-party privacy, which means that each party gets their own privacy guarantees that depend on their own choice of the servers; (2) per-party complexity, which means that each party only needs to communicate with their chosen servers. Our primary contribution is a new theoretical framework for server-aided MPC. We provide two protocols to show feasibility, but leave it as a future work to investigate protocols that focus on concrete efficiency.",

We give an explicit parametrization of the maximal orders in $B_{p,\\infty}$ appearing as endomorphism rings of the elliptic curves in this graph that are $\\leq e$ steps away from a root vertex with $j$-invariant 1728. This is the first explicit parametrization of this kind and we believe it will be an aid in better understanding the structure of supersingular $\\ell$-isogeny graphs that are widely used in cryptography. Our method makes use of the inherent directions in the supersingular isogeny graph induced via Bruhat-Tits trees, as studied in [1]. We also discuss how in future work other interesting use cases, such as $\\ell=2$, could benefit from the same methodology.",

    "abstract": "We introduce ZODA, short for 'zero-overhead data availability,' which is a protocol for proving that symbols received from an encoding (for tensor codes) were correctly constructed. ZODA has optimal overhead for both the encoder and the samplers. Concretely, the ZODA scheme incurs essentially no incremental costs (in either computation or size) beyond those of the tensor encoding itself. In particular, we show that a slight modification to the encoding scheme for tensor codes allows sampled rows and columns of this modified encoding to become proofs of their own correctness. When used as part of a data availability sampling protocol, both encoders (who encode some data using a tensor code with some slight modifications) and samplers (who sample symbols from the purported encoding and verify that these samples are correctly encoded) incur no incremental communication costs and only small additional computational costs over having done the original tensor encoding. ZODA additionally requires no trusted setup and is plausibly post-quantum secure.",

    "abstract": "Unprotected cryptographic implementations are vulnerable to implementation attacks, such as passive side-channel attacks and active fault injection attacks. Recently, countermeasures like polynomial masking and duplicated masking have been introduced to protect implementations against combined attacks that exploit leakage and faults simultaneously.\r\nWhile duplicated masking requires $O(t * e)$ shares to resist an adversary capable of probing $t$ values and faulting $e$ values, polynomial masking requires only $O(t + e)$ shares, which is particularly beneficial for affine computation. \r\nAt CHES'$24$, Arnold et al. showed how to further improve the efficiency of polynomial masking in the presence of combined attacks by embedding two secrets into one polynomial sharing. This essentially reduces the complexity of previous constructions by half. The authors also observed that using techniques from packed secret sharing (Grosso et al., CHES'$13$) cannot easily achieve combined resilience to encode an arbitrary number of secrets in one polynomial encoding.\r\nIn this work, we resolve these challenges and show that it is possible to embed an arbitrary number of secrets in one encoding and propose gadgets that are secure against combined attacks. We present two constructions that are generic and significantly improve the computational and randomness complexity of existing compilers, such as the laOla compiler presented by Berndt et al. at CRYPTO'$23$ and its improvement by Arnold et al. \r\nFor example, for an AES evaluation that protects against $t$ probes and $e$ faults, we improve the randomness complexity of the state-of-the-art construction when $t+e>3$, leading to an improvement of up to a factor of $2.41$.",

    "abstract": "It is imperative to modernize traditional core cryptographic primitives, such as Oblivious Transfer (OT), to address the demands of the new digital era, where privacy-preserving computations are executed on low-power devices. This modernization is not merely an enhancement but a necessity to ensure security, efficiency, and continued relevance in an ever-evolving technological landscape. \r\n\r\nThis work introduces two scalable OT schemes: (1) Helix OT, a $1$-out-of-$n$ OT, and (2) Priority OT, a $t$-out-of-$n$ OT. Both schemes provide unconditional security, ensuring resilience against quantum adversaries. Helix OT achieves a receiver-side download complexity of $O(1)$. In big data scenarios, where certain data may be more urgent or valuable, we propose Priority OT. With a receiver-side download complexity of $O(t)$, this scheme allows data to be received based on specified priorities. By prioritizing data transmission, Priority OT ensures that the most important data is received first, optimizing bandwidth, storage, and processing resources.  Performance evaluations indicate that Helix OT completes the transfer of 1 out of $n=$ 16,777,216 messages in 9 seconds, and Priority OT handles $t=$ 1,048,576 out of $n$ selections in 30 seconds. Both outperform existing $t$-out-of-$n$ OTs (when $t\\geq 1$), underscoring their suitability for large-scale applications. To the best of our knowledge, Helix OT and Priority OT introduce unique advancements that distinguish them from previous schemes.",

    "abstract": "Proof-of-stake consensus protocols often rely on distributed randomness beacons (DRBs) to generate randomness for leader selection. This work analyses the manipulability of Ethereum's DRB implementation, RANDAO, in its current consensus mechanism. Even with its efficiency, RANDAO remains vulnerable to manipulation through the deliberate omission of blocks from the canonical chain. Previous research has shown that economically rational players can withhold blocks --~known as a block withholding attack or selfish mixing~-- when the manipulated RANDAO outcome yields greater financial rewards.\r\n\r\nWe introduce and evaluate a new manipulation strategy, the RANDAO forking attack. Unlike block withholding, whereby validators opt to hide a block, this strategy relies on selectively forking out an honest proposer's block to maximize transaction fee revenues and block rewards. \r\nIn this paper, we draw attention to the fact that the forking attack is significantly more harmful than selfish mixing for two reasons. Firstly, it exacerbates the unfairness among validators. More importantly, it significantly undermines the reliability of the blockchain for the average user by frequently causing already published blocks to be forked out. By doing so, the attacker can fork the chain without losing slots, and we demonstrate that these are later fully compensated for. Our empirical measurements, investigating such manipulations on Ethereum mainnet, revealed no statistically significant traces of these attacks to date.",

    "abstract": "Stateless blockchain designs have emerged to address the challenge of growing blockchain size using succinct global states. Previous works have developed vector commitments that support proof updates and aggregation to be used as such states. However, maintaining proofs for multiple users still demands significant computational resources, particularly to update proofs with every transaction.  This paper introduces Cauchyproofs, a batch-updatable vector commitment that enables proof-serving nodes to efficiently update proofs in quasi-linear time relative to the number of users and transactions, utilizing an optimized KZG scheme to achieve complexity $O\\left(\\left(\\left|\\vec{\\alpha}\\right| + \\left|\\vec{\\beta}\\right|\\right) \\log^2 (\\left|\\vec{\\alpha}\\right| + \\left|\\vec{\\beta}\\right|)\\right)$ for $\\left|\\alpha\\right|$ users and $\\left|\\beta\\right|$ transactions, compared to the previous $O\\left(\\left|\\vec{\\alpha}\\right|\\cdot|\\vec{\\beta}|\\right)$ approaches. This advancement reduces the computational burden on proof-serving nodes, allowing efficient proof maintenance across large user groups. We demonstrate that our approach is approximately five times faster than the naive approach at the Ethereum-level block size. Additionally, we present a novel matrix representation for KZG proofs utilizing Cauchy matrices, enabling faster all-proof computations with reduced elliptic curve operations. Finally, we propose an algorithm for history proof query, supporting retrospective proof generation with high efficiency. Our contributions substantially enhance the scalability and practicality of proof-serving nodes in stateless blockchain frameworks.",

    "abstract": "Verifiable random access machines (vRAMs) serve as a foundational model for expressing complex computations with provable security guarantees, serving applications in areas such as secure electronic voting, financial auditing, and privacy-preserving smart contracts. However, no existing vRAM provides distributed obliviousness, a critical need in scenarios where multiple provers seek to prevent disclosure against both other provers and the verifiers.\r\nImplementing a publicly verifiable distributed oblivious RAM (VDORAM) presents several challenges. Firstly, the development of VDORAM is hindered by the limited availability of sophisticated publicly verifiable multi-party computation (MPC) protocols. Secondly, the lack of readily available front-end implementations for multi-prover zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) poses a significant obstacle to developing practical applications. Finally, directly adapting existing RAM designs to the VDORAM paradigm may prove either impractical or inefficient due to the inherent complexities of reconciling oblivious computation with the generation of publicly verifiable proofs.\r\n\r\nTo address these challenges, we introduce CompatCircuit, the first multi-prover ZKP front-end implementation to our knowledge. CompatCircuit integrates collaborative zkSNARKs to implement publicly verifiable MPC protocols with rich functionalities beyond those of an arithmetic circuit, enabling the development of multi-prover ZKP applications. Building upon CompatCircuit, we present VDORAM, the first publicly verifiable distributed oblivious RAM. By combining distributed oblivious architectures with verifiable RAM, VDORAM achieves an efficient RAM design that balances communication overhead and proof generation time. We have implemented CompatCircuit and VDORAM in approximately 15,000 lines of code, demonstrating usability by providing a practical and efficient implementation. Our performance evaluation result reveals that the system still provides moderate performance with distributed obliviousness.",

    "abstract": "The Signal protocol relies on a special handshake protocol, formerly X3DH and now PQXDH, to set up secure conversations. Prior analyses of these protocols (or proposals for post-quantum alternatives) have all used highly tailored models to the individual protocols and generally made ad-hoc adaptations to \"standard\" AKE definitions, making the concrete security attained unclear and hard to compare between similar protocols. Indeed, we observe that some natural Signal handshake protocols cannot be handled by these tailored models. In this work, we introduce Bundled Authenticated Key Exchange (BAKE), a concrete treatment of the Signal handshake protocol. We formally model prekey bundles and states, enabling us to define various levels of security in a unified model. We analyze Signal's classically secure X3DH and harvest-now-decrypt-later-secure PQXDH, and show that they do not achieve what we call optimal security (as is documented). Next, we introduce RingXKEM, a fully post-quantum Signal handshake protocol achieving optimal security; as RingXKEM shares states among many prekey bundles, it could not have been captured by prior models. Lastly, we provide a security and efficiency comparison of X3DH, PQXDH, and RingXKEM.",

    "abstract": "An anonymous credential (AC) system with partial disclosure allows users to prove possession of a credential issued by an issuer while selectively disclosing a subset of their attributes to a verifier in a privacy-preserving manner. In keyed-verification AC (KVAC) systems, the issuer and verifier share a secret key. Existing KVAC schemes rely on computationally expensive zero-knowledge proofs during credential presentation, with the presentation size growing linearly with the number of attributes. In this work, we propose two highly efficient KVAC constructions that eliminate the need for zero-knowledge proofs during the credential presentation and achieve constant-size presentations.\r\n    Our first construction adapts the approach of Fuchsbauer et al. (JoC'19), which achieved constant-size credential presentation in a publicly verifiable setting using their proposed structure-preserving signatures on equivalence classes (SPS-EQ) and set commitment schemes, to the KVAC setting. We introduce structure-preserving message authentication codes on equivalence classes (SP-MAC-EQ) and designated-verifier set commitments (DVSC), resulting in a KVAC system with constant-size credentials (2 group elements) and presentations (4 group elements). To avoid the bilinear groups and pairing operations required by SP-MAC-EQ, our second construction uses a homomorphic MAC with a simplified DVSC. While this sacrifices constant-size credentials ($n+2$ group elements, where $n$ is the number of attributes), it retains constant-size presentations (2 group elements) in a pairingless setting. \r\n    We formally prove the security of both constructions and provide open-source implementation results demonstrating their practicality. We extensively benchmarked our KVAC protocols and, additionally, bechmarked the efficiency of our SP-MAC-EQ scheme against the original SPS-EQ scheme, showcasing significant performance improvements.",

Consider the rational quaternion algebra ramified at $p$ and $\\infty$ with a fixed maximal order $\\mathcal{O}_{1728}$. We give explicit formulae for bases of all cyclic norm $\\ell^n$ ideals of $\\mathcal{O}_{1728}$ and their right orders, in Hermite Normal Form (HNF). Further, in the case $\\ell \\mid p+1$, or more generally, $-p$ is a square modulo $\\ell$, we derive a parametrization of these bases along paths of the $\\ell$-ideal graph, generalising the results of [1]. With such orders appearing as the endomorphism rings of supersingular elliptic curves defined over $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_{p}}$, we note several potential applications to isogeny-based cryptography including fast ideal sampling algorithms. We also demonstrate how our findings may lead to further structural observations, by using them to prove a result on the successive minima of endomorphism rings of supersingular curves defined over $\\mathbb{F}_p$.\r\n\r\n[1] = https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/033",

    "abstract": "Selfish mining attacks present a serious threat to Bitcoin security, enabling a miner with less than 51% of the network hashrate to gain higher rewards than when mining honestly. A growing body of works has studied the impact of such attacks and presented numerous strategies under a variety of model settings. This led to a complex landscape with conclusions that are often exclusive to certain model assumptions. This growing complexity makes it hard to comprehend the state of the art and distill its impact and trade-offs.\r\n    \r\nIn this paper, we demystify the landscape of selfish mining by presenting a systematization framework of existing studies and evaluating their strategies under realistic model adaptations. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first of its kind. We develop a multi-dimensional systematization framework assessing prior works based on their strategy formulation and targeted models. We go on to distill a number of insights and gaps clarifying open questions and understudied areas. Among them, we find that most studies target the block-reward setting and do not account for transaction fees, and generally study the single attacker case. To bridge this gap, we evaluate many of the existing strategies in the no-block-reward setting---so miner's incentives come solely from transaction fees---for both the single and multi-attacker scenarios. We also extend their models to include a realistic honest-but-rational miners showing how such adaptations could garner more-performant strategy variations. Finally, we touch upon defenses proposed in the literature, and discuss connections between selfish mining and relevant incentivized/fee-driven paradigms.",

    "abstract": "Registered attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a generalization of public-key encryption that enables fine-grained access control to encrypted data (like standard ABE), but without needing a central trusted authority. In a key-policy registered ABE scheme, users choose their own public and private keys and then register their public keys together with a decryption policy with an (untrusted) key curator. The key curator aggregates all of the individual public keys into a short master public key which serves as the public key for an ABE scheme.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we can build registered ABE for restricted policies (e.g., Boolean formulas) from pairing-based assumptions and for general policies using witness encryption or indistinguishability obfuscation. In this work, we construct a key-policy registered ABE for general policies (specifically, bounded-depth Boolean circuits) from the $\\ell$-succinct learning with errors (LWE) assumption in the random oracle model. The ciphertext size in our registered ABE scheme is $\\mathsf{poly}(\\lambda, d)$, where $\\lambda$ is a security parameter and $d$ is the depth of the circuit that computes the policy circuit $C$. Notably, this is independent of the length of the attribute $\\mathbf{x}$ and is optimal up to the $\\mathsf{poly}(d)$ factor.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the only lattice-based instantiation of registered ABE uses witness encryption, which relies on private-coin evasive LWE, a stronger assumption than $\\ell$-succinct LWE. Moreover, the ciphertext size in previous registered ABE schemes that support general policies (i.e., from obfuscation or witness encryption) scales with $\\mathsf{poly}(\\lambda, |\\mathbf{x}|, |C|)$. The ciphertext size in our scheme depends only on the depth of the circuit (and not the length of the attribute or the size of the policy). This enables new applications to identity-based distributed broadcast encryption.\r\n\r\nOur techniques are also useful for constructing adaptively-secure (distributed) broadcast encryption, and we give the first scheme from the $\\ell$-succinct LWE assumption in the random oracle model. Previously, the only lattice-based broadcast encryption scheme with adaptive security relied on witness encryption in the random oracle model. All other lattice-based broadcast encryption schemes only achieved selective security.",

    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows a server to perform computations directly over the encrypted data. In general FHE protocols, the client is tasked with decrypting the computation result using its secret key. However, certain FHE applications benefit from the server knowing this result, especially without the aid of the client. Providing the server with the secret key allows it to decrypt all the data, including the client's private input. Protocols such as Goldwasser et. al. (STOC'13) have shown that it is possible to provide the server with the capability of conditional decryption that allows it to decrypt the result of some pre-defined computation and nothing else. While beneficial to an honest-but-curious server to aid in  providing better services, a malicious server may utilize this added advantage to perform active attacks on the overall FHE application to leak secret information. Existing security notions fail to capture this scenario since they assume that only the client has the ability to decrypt FHE ciphertexts. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new security notion named IND-CPA$^{\\text{C}}$, that provides the adversary with access to a conditional decryption oracle. We then show that none of the practical exact FHE schemes are secure under this notion by demonstrating a generic attack that utilizes this restricted decryption capability to recover the underlying errors in the FHE ciphertexts. Given the security guarantee of the underlying (R)LWE hardness problem collapses with the leakage of these error values, we show a full key recovery attack. Finally, we propose a technique to convert any IND-CPA secure FHE scheme into an IND-CPA$^\\text{C}$ secure FHE scheme. Our technique utilizes Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge, where the server is forced to generate a proof of an honest computation of the requested function along with the computation result. During decryption, the proof is verified, and the decryption proceeds only if the verification holds. Both the verification and decryption steps run inside a Garbled Circuit and thus are not observable or controllable by the server.",

    "abstract": "A secret-sharing scheme allows the distribution of a secret $s$ among $n$ parties, such that only certain predefined \u201cauthorized\u201d sets of parties can reconstruct the secret, while all other \u201cunauthorized\u201d sets learn nothing about $s$. The collection of authorized/unauthorized sets is defined by a monotone function $f: \\{0,1\\}^n \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$. It is known that any monotone function can be realized by a secret-sharing scheme; thus, the smallest achievable \\emph{total share size}, $S(f)$, serves as a natural complexity measure.\r\nIn this paper, we initiate the study of the following meta-complexity question: Given a monotone function $f$, is it possible to efficiently distinguish between cases where the secret-sharing complexity of $f$ is small versus large? We examine this question across several computational models, yielding the following main results.\r\n\r\n(Hardness for formulas and circuits): Given a monotone formula $f$ of size $L$, it is coNP-hard to distinguish between ``cheap'' functions, where the maximum share size is 1 bit and the total share size is $O(L^{0.01})$, and ``expensive'' functions, where the maximum share size is $\\Omega(\\sqrt{L})$ and the total share size is $\\Omega(L/\\log L)$.\r\nThis latter bound nearly matches known secret-sharing constructions yielding a total share size of $L$ bits. For monotone circuits, we strengthen the bound on the expensive case to a maximum share size of $\\Omega(L/\\log L)$ and a total share size of $\\Omega(L^2/\\log L)$. These results rule out the existence of instance-optimal compilers that map a formula $f$ to a secret-sharing scheme with complexity polynomially related to $S(f)$.\r\n\r\n(Hardness for truth tables): Under cryptographic assumptions, either (1) every $n$-bit slice function can be realized by a  $\\text{poly}(n)$-size secret-sharing scheme, or (2) given a truth-table representation of $f$ of size $N = 2^n$, it is computationally infeasible to distinguish in time $\\text{poly}(N)$ between cases where $S(f) = \\text{poly}(n)$ and $S(f) = n^{\\omega(1)}$. Option (1) would be considered a breakthrough result, as the best-known construction for slices has a sub-exponential complexity of $2^{\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})}$ (Liu, Vaikuntanathan, and Wee; Eurocrypt 2018). Our proof introduces a new worst-case-to-average-case reduction for slices, which may be of independent interest.\r\n\r\n(Hardness for graphs): We examine the simple case where $f$ is given as a 2-DNF, represented by a graph $G$ whose edges correspond to 2-terms, and ask whether it is possible to distinguish between cases where the share size is constant and those where the share size is large, say $\\Omega(\\log n)$. We establish several connections between this question and questions in communication complexity. For instance, we show that graphs admitting constant-cost secret sharing form a subclass of graphs with constant randomized communication complexity and constant-size adjacency sketches (Harms, Wild, and Zamaraev; STOC 2022). We leverage these connections to establish new lower bounds for specific graph families, derive a combinatorial characterization of graphs with constant-size linear secret-sharing schemes, and show that a natural class of myopic algorithms fails to distinguish cheap graphs from expensive ones.",

    "abstract": "Time-lock puzzles (TLP) are a cryptographic tool that allow one to encrypt a message into the future, for a predetermined amount of time $T$. At present, we have only two constructions with provable security: One based on the repeated squaring assumption and the other based on obfuscation. Basing TLP on any other assumption is a long-standing question, further motivated by the fact that known constructions are broken by quantum algorithms.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose a new approach to construct time-lock puzzles based on lattices, and therefore with plausible post-quantum security. We obtain the following main results:\r\n\r\n* In the preprocessing model, where a one-time public-coin preprocessing is allowed, we obtain a time-lock puzzle with encryption time $\\log(T)$.\r\n\r\n* In the plain model, where the encrypter does all the computation, we obtain a time-lock puzzle with encryption time $\\sqrt{T}$. \r\n\r\nBoth constructions assume the existence of any sequential function $f$, and the hardness of the circular small-secret learning with errors (LWE) problem. At the heart of our results is a new construction of succinct randomized encodings (SRE) for $T$-folded repeated circuits, where the complexity of the encoding is $\\sqrt{T}$. This is the first construction of SRE where the overall complexity of the encoding algorithm is sublinear in the runtime $T$, and which is not based on obfuscation. As a direct corollary, we obtain a non-interactive RAM delegation scheme with sublinear complexity (in the number of steps $T$).",

    "abstract": "Privacy and security have become critical priorities in many scenarios. Privacy-preserving computation (PPC) is a powerful solution that allows functions to be computed directly on encrypted data. Garbled circuit (GC) is a key PPC technology that enables secure, confidential computing. GC comes in two forms: Boolean GC supports all operations by expressing functions as logic circuits; arithmetic GC is a newer technique to efficiently compute a set of arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication. Mixed GC combines both Boolean and arithmetic GC, in an attempt to optimize performance by computing each function in its most natural form. However, this introduces additional costly conversions between the two forms. It remains unclear if and when the efficiency gains of arithmetic GC outweigh these conversion costs.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present A\u0332rithmetic \u1e06oolean \u1e3aogic E\u0332xchange for Garbled Circuit, the first real implementation of mixed GC. ABLE profiles the performance of Boolean and arithmetic GC operations along with their conversions. We assess not only communication but also computation latency, a crucial factor in evaluating the end-to-end runtime of GC. Based on these insights, we propose a method to determine whether it is more efficient to use general Boolean GC or mixed GC for a given application. Rather than implementing both approaches to identify the better solution for each unique case, our method enables users to select the most suitable GC realization early in the design process. This method evaluates whether the benefits of transitioning operations from Boolean to arithmetic GC offset the associated conversion costs. We apply this approach to a neural network task as a case study.\r\n\r\nImplementing ABLE reveals opportunities for further GC optimization. We propose a heuristic to reduce the number of primes in arithmetic GC, cutting communication by 14.1% and compute latency by 15.7% in a 16-bit system. Additionally, we optimize mixed GC conversions with row reduction technique, achieving a 48.6% reduction in garbled table size for bit-decomposition and a 50% reduction for bit-composition operation. These improvements reduce communication overhead in stream GC and free up storage in the GC with preprocessing approach. We open source our code for community use.",

    "abstract": "Cryptojacking, the unauthorised use of computing resources to mine cryptocurrency, has emerged as a critical threat in today\u2019s digital landscape. These attacks not only compromise system integrity but also result in increased costs, reduced hardware lifespan, and heightened network security risks. Early and accurate detection is essential to mitigate the adverse effects of cryptojacking. This study focuses on developing a semi-supervised machine learning (ML) approach that leverages an autoencoder for feature extraction and a random forest (RF) model for classification. The objective is to enhance cryptojacking detection while maintaining a balance between accuracy and interpretability. The proposed methodology is further enhanced with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques such as local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) to offer insights into model predictions. Results from datasets such as UGRansome and BitcoinHeist indicate that the semi-supervised approach achieves accuracy rates ranging from 70% to 99%. The study demonstrates that the proposed model provides an efficient, interpretable, and scalable solution for real-time cryptojacking detection across various scenarios.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the first black-box registered ABE for circuit from lattices. The selective security is based on evasive LWE assumption [EUROCRYPT'22, CRYPTO'22]. The unique prior Reg-ABE scheme from lattices is derived from non-black-box construction based on function-binding hash and witness encryption [CRYPTO'23]. Technically, we first extend the black-box registration-based encryption from standard LWE [CRYPTO'23] so that we can register a public key with a function; this yields a LWE-based Reg-ABE with ciphertexts of size $L \\cdot \\mathsf{polylog}(L)$ where $L$ is the number of users. We then make use of the special structure of its ciphertext to reduce its size to $\\mathsf{polylog}(L)$ via an algebraic obfuscator based on evasive LWE [CRYPTO'24].",

    "abstract": "Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) protocols that achieve Identifiable Abort (IA) guarantee honest parties that in the event that they are denied output, they will be notified of the identity of at least one corrupt party responsible for the abort. Cheater identification provides recourse in the event of a protocol failure, and in some cases can even be desired over Guaranteed Output Delivery. However, protocols in the literature typically make use of broadcast as a necessary tool in identifying cheaters. In many deployments, the broadcast channel itself may be the most expensive component.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we investigate if it is inherent that MPC with IA should bear the full complexity of broadcast. As the implication of broadcast from IA has been established in previous work, we relax our target to circumvent this connection: we allow honest parties to differ in which cheaters they identify, nonetheless retaining the ability to prove claims of cheating to an auditor.\r\n\r\nWe show that in the honest majority setting, our notion of Provable Identifiable Selective Abort (PISA) can be achieved without a traditional broadcast channel. Indeed, broadcast in this setting---which we term Broadcast with Selective Identifiable Abort (BC-IA)---is achievable in only two point-to-point rounds with a simple echoing technique. On the negative side, we also prove that BC-IA is impossible to achieve in the dishonest majority setting.\r\n\r\nAs a general result, we show that any MPC protocol that achieves IA with $r$ broadcasts, can be compiled to one that achieves PISA with $2(r+1)$ point to point rounds. As a practical application of this methodology, we design, implement, and benchmark a six-round honest majority threshold ECDSA protocol that achieves PISA, and can be deployed in any environment with point to point communication alone.",

    "abstract": "Zero-knowledge proofs of training (zkPoT) allow a party to prove that a model is trained correctly on a committed dataset without revealing any additional information about the model or the dataset. Existing zkPoT protocols prove the entire training process in zero knowledge; i.e., they prove that the final model was obtained in an iterative fashion starting from the training data and a random seed (and potentially other parameters) and applying the correct algorithm at each iteration. This approach inherently requires the prover to perform work linear to the number of iterations. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we take a different approach to proving the correctness of model training. Our approach is motivated by efficiency but also more urgently by the observation that the prover's ability to pick the random seed used for training introduces the potential for it to bias the model. In other words, if the input to the training algorithm is biased, the resulting model will be biased even if the prover correctly ran the training algorithm. Rather than prove the correctness of the training process, we thus directly prove the correctness of the training model using a notion we call optimum vicinity, which bounds the distance between the trained model and the mathematically optimal model for models that can be viewed as the solution to a convex optimization problem. We show both theoretically and experimentally that this ensures the trained model behaves similarly to the optimal model, and show this is not true for existing approaches. We also demonstrate significant performance improvements as compared to the existing zkPoT paradigm: the statement proven in ZK in our protocol has a size independent of the number of training iterations, and our Boolean (respectively arithmetic) circuit size is up to $246\\times$ (respectively $5\\times$) smaller than that of a baseline zkPoT protocol that verifies the whole training process.",

    "abstract": "Fuzzy private set intersection (Fuzzy PSI) is a cryptographic protocol for privacy-preserving similarity matching, which is one of the essential operations in various real-world applications such as facial authentication, information retrieval, or recommendation systems. Despite recent advancements in fuzzy PSI protocols, still a huge barrier remains in deploying them for these applications. The main obstacle is the high dimensionality, e.g., from 128 to 512, of data; lots of existing methods, Garimella et al. (CRYPTO\u201923, CRYPTO\u201924) or van Baarsen et al. (EUROCRYPT\u201924), suffer from exponential overhead on communication and/or computation cost. In addition, the dominant similarity metric in these applications is cosine similarity, which disables several optimization tricks based on assumptions for the distribution of data, e.g., techniques by Gao et al. (ASIACRYPT\u201924). In this paper, we propose a novel fuzzy PSI protocol for cosine similarity, called FPHE, that overcomes these limitations at the same time. FPHE features linear complexity on both computation and communication with respect to the dimension of set elements, only requiring much weaker assumption than prior works. The basic strategy of ours is to homomorphically compute cosine similarity and run an approximated comparison function, with a clever packing method for efficiency. In addition, we introduce a novel proof technique to harmonize the approximation error from the sign function with the noise flooding, proving the security of FPHE under the semi-honest model. Moreover, we show that our construction can be extended to support various functionalities, such as labeled or circuit fuzzy PSI. Through experiments, we show that FPHE can perform fuzzy PSI over 512-dimensional data in a few minutes, which was computationally infeasible for all previous proposals under the same assumption as ours.",

    "abstract": "With the threat posed by quantum computers on the horizon, systems like Ethereum must transition to cryptographic primitives resistant to quantum attacks. One of the most critical of these primitives is the non-interactive multi-signature scheme used in Ethereum's proof-of-stake consensus, currently implemented with BLS signatures. This primitive enables validators to independently sign blocks, with their signatures then publicly aggregated into a compact aggregate signature.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we introduce a family of hash-based signature schemes as post-quantum alternatives to BLS. We consider the folklore method of aggregating signatures via (hash-based) succinct arguments, and our work is focused on instantiating the underlying signature scheme. The proposed schemes are variants of the XMSS signature scheme, analyzed within a novel and unified framework. While being generic, this framework is designed to minimize security loss, facilitating efficient parameter selection. A key feature of our work is the avoidance of random oracles in the security proof. Instead, we define explicit standard model requirements for the underlying hash functions. This eliminates the paradox of simultaneously treating hash functions as random oracles and as explicit circuits for aggregation. Furthermore, this provides cryptanalysts with clearly defined targets for evaluating the security of hash functions. Finally, we provide recommendations for practical instantiations of hash functions and concrete parameter settings, supported by known and novel heuristic bounds on the standard model properties.",

    "abstract": "The impossible boomerang attack is a very powerful attack, and the existing results show that it is more effective than the impossible differential attack in the related-key scenario. However, in the current key recovery process, the details of a block cipher are ignored, only fixed keys are pre-guessed, and the time complexity of the early abort technique is roughly estimated. These limitations are obstacles to the broader application of impossible boomerang attack. In this paper, we propose the pre-sieving technique, partial pre-guess key technique and precise complexity evaluation technique. For the pre-sieving technique, we capitalize on the specific features of both the linear layer and the nonlinear layer to expeditiously filter out the impossible quartets at the earliest possible stage. Regarding the partial pre-guess key technique, we are able to selectively determine the keys that require guessing according to our requirements. Moreover, the precise complexity evaluation technique empowers us to explicitly compute the complexity associated with each step of the attack. We integrate these techniques and utilize them to launch an attack on ARADI, which is a low-latency block cipher proposed by the NSA (National Security Agency) in 2024 for the purpose of memory encryption. Eventually, we achieve the first full-round attack with a data complexity of $2^{130}$, a time complexity of $2^{254.81}$, and a memory complexity of $2^{252.14}$. None of the previous key recovery methods have been able to attain such an outcome, thereby demonstrating the high efficacy of our new technique.",

    "abstract": "The increasing number of blockchain projects introduced annually has led to a pressing need for secure and efficient interoperability solutions. Currently, the lack of such solutions forces end-users to rely on centralized intermediaries, contradicting the core principle of decentralization and trust minimization in blockchain technology. In this paper, we propose a decentralized and efficient interoperability solution (aka Bridge Protocol) that operates without additional trust assumptions, relying solely on the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) of the two chains being connected. In particular, relayers (actors that exchange messages between networks) are permissionless and decentralized, hence eliminating any single point of failure. We introduce Random Sampling, a novel technique for on-chain light clients to efficiently follow the history of PoS blockchains by reducing the signature verifications required. Here, the randomness is drawn on-chain, for example, using Ethereum's RANDAO. We analyze the security of the bridge from a crypto- economic perspective and provide a framework to derive the security parameters. This includes handling subtle concurrency issues and randomness bias in strawman designs. While the protocol is applicable to various PoS chains, we demonstrate its feasibility by instantiating a bridge between Polkadot and Ethereum (currently deployed), and discuss some practical security challenges. We also evaluate the efficiency (gas costs) of an on-chain light-client verifier implemented as a smart contract on ethereum against SNARK-based approaches. Even for large validator set sizes (up to $10^6$), the signature verification gas costs of our light-client verifier are a magnitude lower.",

    "abstract": "Arithmetic hash functions defined over prime fields have been actively developed and used in verifiable computation (VC) protocols. Among those, elliptic-curve-based SNARKs require large (\\(256\\)-bit and higher) primes. Such hash functions are notably slow, losing a factor of up to \\(1000\\) compared to regular constructions like SHA-2/3.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present the hash function $\\textsf{Skyscraper}$, which is aimed at large prime fields and provides major improvements compared to $\\texttt{Reinforced Concrete}$ and $\\texttt{Monolith}$. First, the design is exactly the same for all large primes, which simplifies analysis and deployment. Secondly, it achieves a performance comparable to cryptographic hash standards by using low-degree non-invertible transformations and minimizing modulo reductions. Concretely, it hashes two \\(256\\)-bit prime field (BLS12-381 curve scalar field) elements in \\(135\\) nanoseconds, whereas SHA-256 needs \\(42\\) nanoseconds on the same machine.\r\n\r\nThe low circuit complexity of $\\textsf{Skyscraper}$, together with its high native speed, should allow a substantial reduction in many VC scenarios, particularly in recursive proofs.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the concept of Fair Signature Exchange (FSE). FSE enables a client to obtain signatures on multiple messages in a fair manner: the client receives all signatures if and only if the signer receives an agreed-upon payment. We formalize security definitions for FSE and present a practical construction based on the Schnorr signature scheme, avoiding computationally expensive cryptographic primitives such as SNARKs. Our scheme imposes minimal overhead on the Schnorr signer and verifier, leaving the signature verification process unchanged from standard Schnorr signatures. Fairness is enforced using a blockchain as a trusted third party, while exchanging only a constant amount of information on-chain regardless of the number of signatures exchanged. We demonstrate how to construct a batch adaptor signature scheme using FSE, and our FSE construction based on Schnorr results in an efficient implementation of a batch Schnorr adaptor signature scheme for the discrete logarithm problem. We implemented our scheme to show that it has negligible overhead compared to standard Schnorr signatures. For instance, exchanging $2^{10}$ signatures on the Vesta curve takes approximately $80$ms for the signer and $300$ms for the verifier, with almost no overhead for the signer and $2$x overhead for the verifier compared to the original Schnorr protocol. Additionally, we propose an extension to blind signature exchange, where the signer does not learn the messages being signed. This is achieved through a natural adaptation of blinded Schnorr signatures.",

    "abstract": "Multiparty computation (MPC) allows a set of mutually distrusting parties to compute a function over their inputs, while keeping those inputs private. Most recent MPC protocols that are ready for real-world applications are based on the so-called preprocessing model, where the MPC is split into two phases: a preprocessing phase, where raw material, independent of the inputs, is produced; and an online phase, which can be efficiently computed, consuming this preprocessed material, when the inputs become available. However, the sheer number of protocols following this paradigm, makes it difficult to navigate through the literature. Our work aims at systematizing existing literature, (1) to make it easier for protocol developers to choose the most suitable preprocessing protocol for their application scenario; and (2) to identify research gaps, so as to give\r\npointers for future work. We devise two main categories for the preprocessing model, which we term traditional and special preprocessing, where the former refers to preprocessing for general purpose functions, and the latter refers to preprocessing for specific functions. We further systematize the protocols based on the underlying cryptographic primitive they use, the mathematical structure they are based on, and for special preprocessing protocols also their target function. For each of the 41 presented protocols, we give the intuition behind their main technical contribution, and we analyze their security properties and relative performance.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a general framework for constructing SNARK-friendly post-quantum signature schemes based on minimal assumptions, specifically the security of an arithmetization-oriented family of permutations. The term \"SNARK-friendly\" here refers to the efficiency of the signature verification process in terms of SNARK constraints, such as R1CS or AIR constraints used in STARKs. Within the CAPSS framework, signature schemes are designed as proofs of knowledge of a secret preimage of a one-way function, where the one-way function is derived from the chosen permutation family. To obtain compact signatures with SNARK-friendly verification, our primary goal is to achieve a hash-based proof system that is efficient in both proof size and arithmetization of the verification process.\r\n\r\nTo this end, we introduce SmallWood, a hash-based polynomial commitment and zero-knowledge argument scheme tailored for statements arising in this context. The SmallWood construction leverages techniques from Ligero, Brakedown, and Threshold-Computation-in-the-Head (TCitH) to achieve proof sizes that outperform the state of the art of hash-based zero-knowledge proof systems for witness sizes ranging from $2^5$ to $2^{16}$.\r\n\r\nFrom the SmallWood proof system and further optimizations for SNARK-friendliness, the CAPSS framework offers a generic transformation of any arithmetization-oriented permutation family into a SNARK-friendly post-quantum signature scheme. We provide concrete instances built on permutations such as Rescue-Prime, Poseidon, Griffin, and Anemoi. For the Anemoi family, achieving 128-bit security, our approach produces signatures of sizes ranging from 9 to 13.3 KB, with R1CS constraints between 19K and 29K. This represents a 4-6$\\times$ reduction in signature size and a 5-8$\\times$ reduction in R1CS constraints compared to Loquat (CRYPTO 2024), a SNARK-friendly post-quantum signature scheme based on the Legendre PRF.",

    "abstract": "We revisit a basic building block in the endeavor to migrate to post-quantum secure cryptography, Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs). KEMs enable the establishment of a shared secret key, using only public communication. When targeting chosen-ciphertext security against quantum attackers, the go-to method is to design a Public-Key Encryption (PKE) scheme and then apply a variant of the  PKE-to-KEM conversion known as the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform, which we revisit in this work. Intuitively, FO ensures chosen-ciphertext security by rejecting dishonest messages. This comes in two flavors -- the KEM could reject by returning  'explicit' failure symbol $\\bot$ or instead by returning a pseudo-random key ('implicit' reject). During the NIST post-quantum standardization process, designers chose implicit rejection, likely due to the availability of security proofs against quantum attackers. On the other hand, implicit rejection introduces complexity and can easily deteriorate into explicit rejection in practice. While it was proven that implicit rejection is not less secure than explicit rejection, the other direction was less clear. This is relevant because the available security proofs against quantum attackers still leave things to be desired. When envisioning future improvements, due to, e.g., advancements in quantum proof techniques, having to treat both variants separately creates unnecessary overhead.\r\nIn this work, we thus re-evaluate the relationship between the two design approaches and address the so-far unexplored direction: in the classical random oracle model, we show that explicit rejection is not less secure than implicit rejection, up to a rare edge case. This, however, uses the observability of random oracle queries. To lift the proof into the quantum world, we make use of the extractable QROM (eQROM). As an alternative that works without the eQROM, we give an indirect proof that involves a new necessity statement on the involved PKE scheme.",

    "abstract": "Searchable encryption (SE) has been widely studied for cloud storage systems, allowing data encrypted search and retrieval. However, existing SE schemes can not support the fine-grained searchability revocation, making it impractical for real applications. Puncturable encryption (PE) [Oakland'15] can revoke the decryption ability of a data receiver for a specific message, which can potentially alleviate this issue. Moreover, the threat of quantum computing remains an important and realistic concern, potentially leading to data privacy leakage for cloud storage systems. Consequently, designing a post-quantum puncturable encrypted search scheme is still far-reaching. In this paper, we propose PunSearch, the first puncturable encrypted search scheme over lattice for outsourced data privacy-preserving in cloud storage systems. PunSearch provides a fine-grained searchability revocation while enjoying quantum safety. Different from existing PE schemes, we construct a novel trapdoor generation mechanism through evaluation algorithms and lattice pre-image sampling technique. We then design a search permission verification method to revoke the searchability for specific keywords. Furthermore, we formalize a new IND-Pun-CKA security model, and utilize it to analyze the security of PunSearch. Comprehensive performance evaluation indicates that the computational overheads of Encrypt, Trapdoor, Search, and Puncture algorithms in PunSearch are just 0.06, 0.005, 0.05, and 0.31 times of other prior arts, respectively under the best cases. These results demonstrate that PunSearch is effective and secure for cloud storage systems.",

    "abstract": "Many cryptographic protocols rely upon an initial \\emph{trusted setup} to generate public parameters.  While the concept is decades old, trusted setups have gained prominence with the advent of blockchain applications utilizing zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs), many of which rely on a ``powers-of-tau'' setup. Because such setups feature a dangerous trapdoor which undermines security if leaked, multiparty protocols are used to prevent the trapdoor from being known by any one party.  Practical setups utilize an elaborate public ceremony to build confidence that the setup was not subverted.  In this paper, we aim to systematize existing knowledge on trusted setups, drawing the distinction between setup \\emph{protocols} and \\emph{ceremonies}, and shed light on the different features of various approaches. We establish a taxonomy of protocols and evaluate real-world ceremonies based on their design principles, strengths, and weaknesses.",

    "abstract": "As Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables computation over encrypted data, it is a natural question of how efficiently it handles standard integer computations like $64$-bit arithmetic. It has long been believed that the CGGI/DM family or the BGV/BFV family are the best options, depending on the size of the parallelism. The Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme, although being widely used in many applications like machine learning, was not considered a good option as it is more focused on computing real numbers rather than integers.\r\n\r\nRecently, Drucker et al. [J. Cryptol.] suggested to use CKKS for discrete computations, by separating the error/noise from the discrete message. Since then, there have been several breakthroughs in the discrete variant of CKKS, including the CKKS-style functional bootstrapping by Bae et al. [Asiacrypt'24]. Notably, the CKKS-style functional bootstrapping can be regarded as a parallelization of CGGI/DM functional bootstrapping, and it is several orders of magnitude faster in terms of throughput. Based on the CKKS-style functional bootstrapping, Kim and Noh [ePrint, 2024/1638] designed an efficient homomorphic modular reduction for CKKS, leading to modulo small integer arithmetic.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is known that CKKS is efficient for handling small integers like $4$ or $8$ bits, it is still unclear whether its efficiency extends to larger integers like $32$ or $64$ bits. In this paper, we propose a novel method for homomorphic unsigned integer computations. We represent a large integer (e.g. $64$-bit) as a vector of smaller chunks (e.g. $4$-bit) and construct arithmetic operations relying on the CKKS-style functional bootstrapping. The proposed scheme supports many of the operations supported in TFHE-rs while outperforming it in terms of amortized running time. Notably, our homomorphic 64-bit multiplication takes $17.9$ms per slot, which is more than three orders of magnitude faster than TFHE-rs.",

    "abstract": "Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based protocols have shown great promise to improve the performance of blockchains. The CAP theorem shows that it is impossible to have a single system that achieves both liveness (known as dynamic availability) and safety under network partition.This paper explores two types of DAG-based protocols prioritizing liveness or safety, named structured dissemination and Graded Common Prefix (GCP), respectively. \r\n    \r\n    For the former, we introduce the first DAG-based protocol with constant expected latency, providing high throughput dynamic availability under the sleepy model. Its expected latency is $3\\Delta$ and its throughput linearly scales with participation. We validate these expected performance improvements over existing constant latency sleepy model BFT by running prototypes of each protocol across multiple machines.\r\n    \r\n    The latter, GCP, is a primitive that provides safety under network partition, while being weaker than standard consensus. As a result, we are able to obtain a construction that runs in only $2$ communication steps, as opposed to the $4$ steps of existing low latency partially synchronous BFT. In addition, GCP can easily avoid relying on single leaders' proposals, becoming more resilient to crashes. We also validate these theoretical benefits of GCP experimentally.\r\n    \r\n    We leverage our findings to extend the Ebb-and-Flow framework, where two BFT sub-protocols allow different types of clients in the same system to prioritize either liveness or safety. Our extension integrates our two types of DAG-based protocols. This provides a hybrid DAG-based protocol with high throughput, dynamical availability, and finality under network partitions, without running a standard consensus protocol twice as required in existing work.",

    "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies allow mutually distrusting users to transact monetary value over the internet without relying on a trusted third party.\r\n\r\nBitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, achieved this through a novel protocol used to establish consensus about an ordered transaction history.\r\nThis requires every transaction to be broadcasted and verified by the network, incurring communication and computational costs.\r\nFurthermore, transactions are visible to all nodes of the network, eroding privacy, and are recorded permanently, contributing to increasing storage requirements over time.\r\nTo limit resource usage of the network, Bitcoin currently supports an average of 11 transactions per second.\r\n\r\nMost cryptocurrencies today still operate in a substantially similar manner.\r\nPrivate cryptocurrencies like Zcash and Monero address the privacy issue by replacing transactions with proofs of transaction validity.\r\nHowever, this enhanced privacy comes at the cost of increased communication, storage, and computational requirements.\r\n\r\nClient-Side Validation (CSV) is a paradigm that addresses these issues by removing transaction validation from the blockchain consensus rules.\r\nThis approach allows sending the coin along with a validity proof directly to its recipient, reducing communication, computation and storage cost.\r\nCSV protocols deployed on Bitcoin today do not fully leverage the paradigm's potential, as they still necessitate the overhead of publishing ordinary Bitcoin transactions.\r\nMoreover, the size of their coin proofs is proportional to the coin's transaction history, and provide limited privacy.\r\nA recent improvement is the Intmax2 CSV protocol, which writes significantly less data to the blockchain compared to a blockchain transaction and has succinct coin proofs.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we introduce Shielded CSV, which improves upon state-of-the-art CSV protocols by providing the first construction that offers truly private transactions.\r\nIt addresses the issues of traditional private cryptocurrency designs by requiring only 64 bytes of data per transaction, called a nullifier, to be written to the blockchain.\r\nMoreover, for each nullifier in the blockchain, Shielded CSV users only need to perform a single Schnorr signature verification, while non-users can simply ignore this data.\r\nThe size and verification cost of coin proofs for Shielded CSV receivers is independent of the transaction history.\r\nThus, one application of Shielded CSV is adding privacy to Bitcoin at a rate of 100 transactions per second, provided there is an adequate bridging mechanism to the blockchain.\r\n\r\nWe specify Shielded CSV using the Proof Carrying Data (PCD) abstraction.\r\nWe then discuss two implementation strategies that we believe to be practical, based on Folding Schemes and Recursive STARKs, respectively.\r\nFinally, we propose future extensions, demonstrating the power of the PCD abstraction and the extensibility of Shielded CSV.\r\nThis highlights the significant potential for further improvements to the Shielded CSV framework and protocols built upon it.",

    "abstract": "One of the most basic properties of a consensus protocol is its fault-tolerance--the maximum fraction of faulty participants that the protocol can tolerate without losing fundamental guarantees such as safety and liveness. Because of its importance, the optimal fault-tolerance achievable by any protocol has been characterized in a wide range of settings. For example, for state machine replication (SMR) protocols operating in the partially synchronous setting, it is possible to simultaneously guarantee consistency against $\\alpha$-bounded adversaries (i.e., adversaries that control less than an $\\alpha$ fraction of the participants) and liveness against $\\beta$-bounded adversaries if and only if $\\alpha + 2\\beta \\leq 1$.\r\n\r\nThis paper characterizes to what extent ``better-than-optimal'' fault-tolerance guarantees are possible for SMR protocols when the standard consistency requirement is relaxed to allow a bounded number $r$ of consistency violations, each potentially leading to the rollback of recently finalized transactions. We prove that bounding rollback  is impossible without additional timing assumptions and investigate protocols that tolerate and recover from consistency violations whenever message delays around the time of an attack are bounded by a parameter $\\Delta^*$ (which may be arbitrarily larger than the parameter $\\Delta$ that bounds post-GST message delays in the partially synchronous model). Here, a protocol's fault-tolerance can be a non-constant function of $r$, and we prove, for each $r$, matching upper and lower bounds on the optimal ``recoverable fault-tolerance'' achievable by any SMR protocol. For example, for protocols that guarantee liveness against 1/3-bounded adversaries in the partially synchronous setting, a 5/9-bounded adversary can always cause one consistency violation but not two, and a 2/3-bounded adversary can always cause two consistency violations but not three.  Our positive results are achieved through a generic ``recovery procedure''  that can be grafted on to any accountable SMR protocol and restores consistency following a violation while rolling back only transactions that were finalized in the previous $2\\Delta^*$ timesteps.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption (HHE) is considered a promising solution for key challenges that emerge when adopting Homomorphic Encryption (HE). In cases such as communication and computation overhead for clients and storage overhead for servers, it combines symmetric cryptography with HE schemes. However, despite a decade of advancements, enhancing HHE usability, performance, and security for practical applications remains a significant stake.\r\nThis work contributes to the field by presenting a comprehensive analysis of prominent HHE schemes, focusing on their performance and security. We implemented three superior schemes--PASTA, HERA, and Rubato--using the Go programming language and evaluated their performance in a client-server setting. To promote open science and reproducibility, we have made our implementation publicly available on GitHub. \r\nFurthermore, we conducted an extensive study of applicable attacks on HHE schemes, categorizing them under algebraic-based, differential-based, linear-based, and LWE-based attacks. Our security analysis revealed that while most existing schemes meet theoretical security requirements, they remain vulnerable to practical attacks. These findings emphasize the need for improvements in practical security measures, such as defining standardized parameter sets and adopting techniques like noise addition to counter these attacks. \r\nThis survey provides insights and guidance for researchers and practitioners to design and develop secure and efficient HHE systems, paving the way for broader real-world adoption.",

    "abstract": "In various real-world situations, a client may need to verify whether specific data elements they possess are part of a set segmented among numerous data holders. \r\nTo maintain user privacy, it\u2019s essential that both the client\u2019s data elements and the data holders\u2019 sets remain encrypted throughout the process. \r\nExisting approaches like Private Set Intersection (PSI), Multi-Party PSI (MPSI), Private Segmented Membership Test (PSMT), and Oblivious RAM (ORAM) face challenges in these contexts.\r\nThey either require data holders to access the sets in plaintext, result in high latency when aggregating data from multiple holders, risk exposing the identity of the party with the matching element, cause a large communication overhead for multiple-element queries, or lead to high false positives.\r\n\r\nThis work introduces the primitive of a Private Segmented Membership Test (PSMT) for clients with multiple query elements. \r\nWe present a basic protocol for solving PSMT using a threshold variant of approximate-arithmetic homomorphic encryption, addressing the challenges of avoiding information leakage about the party with the intersection element, minimizing communication overhead for multiple query elements, and preventing false positives for a large number of data holders ensuring IND-CPA^D security.\r\nOur novel approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in scalability, supporting significantly more data holders.\r\nThis is achieved through a novel summation-based homomorphic membership check rather than a product-based one, as well as various novel ideas addressing technical challenges. \r\n\r\nOur new PSMT protocol supports a large number of parties and query elements (up to 4096 parties and 512 queries in experiments) compared to previous methods.\r\nOur experimental evaluation shows that our method's aggregation of results from 1024 data holders with a set size of 2^15 can run in 71.2s and only requires an additional 1.2 seconds per query for processing multiple queries.\r\nWe also compare our PSMT protocol to other state-of-the-art PSI and MPSI protocols and our previous work and discuss our improvements in usability with a better privacy model and a larger number of parties and queries.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we define the conditional constant function problem (CCFP) and, for a special case of CCFP, we propose a quantum algorithm for solving it efficiently. Such an algorithm enables us to make new evaluations to the quantum security of Feistel block cipher in the case  where a quantum adversary only has the ability to make online queries in a classical manner, which is relatively realistic. Specifically, we  significantly improved the chosen-plaintext key recovery attacks on two  Feistel block cipher variants known as  Feistel-KF and  Feistel-FK. For Feistel-KF, we construct a 3-round distinguisher based on the special case of CCFP and propose key recovery attacks mounting to $r>3$ rounds. For Feistel-FK, our CCFP based distinguisher covers 4 rounds and the key recovery attacks are applicable for $r>4$ rounds. Utilizing our CCFP solving algorithm,  we are able to reduce the classical memory complexity of our key recovery attacks from the previous exponential $O(2^{cn})$ to $O(1)$.\r\nThe query complexity of our key recovery attacks on Feistel-KF is also significantly reduced from  $O(2^{cn})$ to $O(1)$ where $c$'s are constants.\r\nOur key recovery results enjoy the current optimal complexities.\r\nThey also indicate that quantum algorithms solving CCFP could be more promising than those solving the period finding problem.",

    "abstract": "The CKKS scheme is traditionally recognized for approximate homomorphic encryption of real numbers, but BLEACH (Drucker et al., JoC 2024) extends its capabilities to handle exact computations on binary or small integer numbers. \r\n\r\nDespite this advancement,  BLEACH's approach of simulating XOR gates via $(a-b)^2$ incurs one multiplication per gate, which is computationally expensive in homomorphic encryption. To this end, we introduce XBOOT, a new framework built upon BLEACH's blueprint but allows for almost free evaluation of XOR gates. The core concept of XBOOT involves lazy reduction, where XOR operations are simulated with the less costly addition operation, $a+b$, leaving the management of potential overflows to later stages. We carefully handle the modulus chain and scale factors to ensure that the overflows would be conveniently rounded during the CKKS bootstrapping phase without extra cost. We use AES-CKKS transciphering as a benchmark to test the capability of XBOOT, and achieve a throughput exceeding one kilobyte per second, which represents a $2.5\\times$ improvement over the state-of-the-art (Aharoni et al., HES 2023). Moreover, XBOOT enables the practical execution of tasks with extensive XOR operations that were previously challenging for CKKS. For example, we can do Rasta-CKKS transciphering at over two kilobytes per second, more than $10\\times$  faster than the baseline without XBOOT.",

    "abstract": "Making the most of TFHE advanced capabilities such as programmable or circuit bootstrapping and their generalizations for manipulating data larger than the native plaintext domain of the scheme is a very active line of research. In this context, AES is a particularly interesting benchmark, as an example of a nontrivial algorithm which has eluded \"practical\" FHE execution performances for years, as well as the fact that it will most likely be selected by NIST as a flagship reference in its upcoming call on threshold (homomorphic) cryptography. Since 2023, the algorithm has thus been the subject of a renewed attention from the FHE community and has served as a playground to test advanced operators following the LUT-based, $p$-encodings or several variants of circuit bootstrapping, each time leading to further timing improvements. Still, AES is also interesting as a benchmark because of the tension between boolean- and byte-oriented operations within the algorithm. In this paper, we resolve this tension by proposing a new approach, coined \"Hippogryph\", which consistently combines the (byte-oriented) LUT-based approach with a generalization of the (boolean-oriented) $p$-encodings one to get the best of both worlds. In doing so, we obtain the best timings so far, getting a single-core execution of the algorithm over TFHE from 46 down to 32 seconds and approaching the 1 second barrier with only a mild amount of parallelism. We should also stress that all the timings reported in this paper are consistently obtained on the same machine which is often not the case in previous studies. Lastly, we emphasize that the techniques we develop are applicable beyond just AES since the boolean-byte tension is a recurrent issue when running algorithms over TFHE.",

    "abstract": "While many side-channel attacks on elliptic curve cryptography can be avoided by coordinate randomization, this is not the case for the zero-value point (ZVP) attack. This attack can recover a prefix of static ECDH key but requires solving an instance of the dependent coordinates problem (DCP), which is open in general. We design a new method for solving the DCP on GLV curves, including the Bitcoin secp256k1 curve, outperforming previous approaches. This leads to a new type of ZVP attack on multiscalar multiplication, recovering twice as many bits when compared to the classical ZVP attack. We demonstrate a $63\\%$ recovery of the private key for the interleaving algorithm for multiscalar multiplication. Finally, we analyze the largest database of curves and addition formulas with over 14 000 combinations and provide the first classification of their resistance against the ZVP attack.",

    "abstract": "The notion of funcCPA security for homomorphic encryption schemes was introduced by Akavia \\textit{et~al.}\\ (TCC 2022). Whereas it aims to capture the bootstrapping technique in homomorphic encryption schemes, Dodis \\textit{et~al.}\\ (TCC 2023) pointed out that funcCPA security can also be applied to non-homomorphic public-key encryption schemes (PKE). As an example, they presented a use case for privacy-preserving outsourced computation without homomorphic computation. It should be noted that prior work on funcCPA security, including the use case presented by Dodis \\textit{et~al.}, considered only the single-key setting. However, in recent years, multi-party collaboration in outsourced computation has garnered significant attention, making it desirable for funcCPA security to support the multi-key setting. Therefore, in this work, we introduce a new notion of security called Multi-Key funcCPA (MKfunc) to address this need, and show that if a PKE scheme is KDM-secure, then it is also MKfuncCPA secure. Furthermore, we show that similar discussions can be applied to symmetric-key encryption.",

    "abstract": "Secure Messaging apps have seen growing adoption, and are used by billions of people daily. However, due to imminent threat of a \"Harvest Now, Decrypt Later\" attack, secure messaging providers must react know in order to make their protocols $\\textit{hybrid-secure}$: at least as secure as before, but now also post-quantum (PQ) secure. Since many of these apps are internally based on the famous Signal's Double-Ratchet (DR) protocol, making Signal hybrid-secure is of great importance.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Signal and Apple already put in production various Signal-based variants with certain levels of hybrid security: PQXDH (only on the initial handshake), and PQ3 (on the entire protocol), by adding a $\\textit{PQ-ratchet}$ to the DR protocol. Unfortunately, due to the large communication overheads of the $\\mathsf{Kyber}$ scheme used by PQ3, real-world PQ3 performs this PQ-ratchet approximately every 50 messages. As we observe, the effectiveness of this amortization, while reasonable in the best-case communication scenario, quickly deteriorates in other still realistic scenarios; causing $\\textit{many consecutive}$ (rather than $1$ in $50$) re-transmissions of the same  $\\mathsf{Kyber}$ public keys and ciphertexts (of combined size 2272 bytes!).\r\n\r\nIn this work we design a new Signal-based, hybrid-secure secure messaging protocol, which significantly reduces the communication complexity of PQ3. We call our protocol \"the $\\textit{Triple Ratchet}$\" (TR) protocol. First, TR uses $\\textit{em erasure codes}$ to make the communication inside the PQ-ratchet provably balanced. This results in much better $\\textit{worst-case}$ communication guarantees of TR, as compared to PQ3. Second, we design a novel \"variant\" of $\\mathsf{Kyber}$, called $\\mathsf{Katana}$, with significantly smaller combined length of ciphertext and public key (which is the relevant efficiency measure for \"PQ-secure ratchets\"). For 192 bits of security, $\\mathsf{Katana}$ improves this key efficiency measure by over 37%: from 2272 to 1416 bytes. In doing so, we identify a critical security flaw in prior suggestions to optimize communication complexity of lattice-based PQ-ratchets, and fix this flaw with a novel proof relying on the recently introduced hint MLWE assumption.\r\n\r\nDuring the development of this work we have been in discussion with the Signal team, and they are actively evaluating bringing a variant of it into production in a future iteration of the Signal protocol.",

    "abstract": "Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX) has emerged as a crucial technology aimed at strengthening the isolation and security guarantees of virtual machines, especially as the demand for secure computation is growing largely. Despite the protections offered by TDX, in this work, we dig deep into the security claims and uncover an intricate observation in TDX. These findings undermine TDX's core security guarantees by breaching the isolation between the Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) and Trust Domains (TDs). In this work for the first time, we show through a series of experiments that these performance counters can also be exploited by the VMM to differentiate between activities of an idle and active TD. The root cause of this leakage is core contention. This occurs when the VMM itself, or a process executed by the VMM, runs on the same core as the TD. Due to resource contention on the core, the effects of the TD's computations become observable in the performance monitors collected by the VMM. This finding underscore the critical need for enhanced protections to bridge these gaps within these advanced virtualized environments.",

    "abstract": "Meet-in-the-middle (MitM) is a powerful approach for the cryptanalysis of symmetric primitives. In recent years, MitM has led to many improved records about key recovery, preimage and collision attacks with the help of automated tools. However, most of the previous work target $\\texttt{AES}$-like hashing where the linear layer is an MDS matrix. And we observe that their automatic model for MDS matrix is not suitable for primitives using a binary matrix as their linear layer.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose the $\\texttt{n-XOR}$ model to describe the $\\texttt{XOR}$ operation with an arbitrary number of inputs. And it can be applied to primitives with a binary matrix of arbitrary size. Then, we propose a check model to eliminate the possible inaccuracies caused by $\\texttt{n-XOR}$. But the check model is limited by the input size (not greater than 4). Combined with the two new models, we find a MitM key recovery attack on 11-round $\\texttt{Midori64}$. When the whitening keys are excluded, a MitM key recovery attack can be mounted on the 12-round $\\texttt{Midori64}$. Compared with the previous best work, both of the above results have distinct advantages in terms of reducing memory and data complexity. \r\nAt last, we apply the $\\texttt{n-XOR}$ model to the hashing modes of primitives with large size binary matrix. The preimage attack on weakened $\\texttt{camellia}-{\\tt MMO}$ (without $FL/FL^{-1}$ and whitening layers) and $\\texttt{Aria}-{\\tt DM}$ are both improved by 1 round.",

    "abstract": "Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) state machine replication (SMR) protocols form the basis of modern blockchains as they maintain a consistent state across all blockchain nodes while tolerating a bounded number of Byzantine faults. We analyze BFT SMR in the excessive fault setting where the actual number of Byzantine faults surpasses a protocol's tolerance. \r\n\r\nWe start by devising the very first repair algorithm for linearly chained and quorum-based partially synchronous SMR to recover from faulty states caused by excessive faults. Such a procedure can be realized using any commission fault detection module -- an algorithm that identifies the faulty replicas without falsely locating any correct replica. We achieve this with a slightly weaker liveness guarantee, as the original security notion is impossible to satisfy given excessive faults.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe implement recoverable HotStuff in Rust. The throughput resumes to the normal level (without excessive faults) after recovery routines terminate for $7$ replicas and is slightly reduced by $\\leq 4.3\\%$ for $30$ replicas. On average, it increases the latency by $12.87\\%$ for $7$ replicas \\usenix{and $8.85\\%$ for $30$ replicas}.\r\n\r\nAside from adopting existing detection modules, we also establish the sufficient condition for a general BFT SMR protocol to allow for complete and sound fault detection when up to $(n-2)$ Byzantine replicas (out of $n$ total replicas) attack safety. We start by providing the first closed-box fault detection algorithm for any SMR protocol without any extra rounds of communication. We then describe open-box instantiations of our fault detection routines in Tendermint and Hotstuff, further reducing the overhead, both asymptotically and concretely.",

    "abstract": "Threshold fully homomorphic encryption (ThFHE) enables multiple parties to compute functions over their sensitive data without leaking data privacy. Most of existing ThFHE schemes are restricted to full threshold and require the participation of all parties to output computing results. Compared with these full-threshold schemes, arbitrary threshold (ATh)-FHE schemes are robust to non-participants and can be a promising solution to many real-world applications. However, existing AThFHE schemes are either inefficient to be applied with a large number of parties $N$ and a large data size $K$, or insufficient to tolerate all types of non-participants. In this paper, we propose an AThFHE scheme to handle all types of non-participants with lower complexity over existing schemes. At the core of our scheme is the reduction from AThFHE construction to the design of a new primitive called approximate secret sharing (ApproxSS). Particularly, we formulate ApproxSS and prove the correctness and security of AThFHE on top of arbitrary-threshold (ATh)-ApproxSS's properties. Such a reduction reveals that existing AThFHE schemes implicitly design ATh-ApproxSS following a similar idea called ``noisy share''. Nonetheless, their ATh-ApproxSS design has high complexity and become the performance bottleneck. By developing ATASSES, an ATh-ApproxSS scheme based on a novel ``encrypted share'' idea, we reduce the computation (resp. communication) complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(N^2K)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(N^2+K)$ (resp. from $\\mathcal{O}(NK)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(N+K)$). We not only theoretically prove the (approximate) correctness and security of ATASSES, but also empirically evaluate its efficiency against existing baselines. Particularly, when applying to a system with one thousand parties, ATASSES achieves a speedup of $3.83\\times$ -- $15.4\\times$ over baselines.",

    "abstract": "Designing post-quantum digital signatures is a very active research area at present, with several protocols being developed, based on a variety of mathematical assumptions. Many of these signatures schemes can be used as a basis to define more advanced schemes, such as ring or threshold signatures, where multiple parties are involved in the signing process. Unfortunately, the majority of these protocols only considers a static adversary, that must declare which parties to corrupt at the beginning of the execution. However, a stronger security notion can be achieved, namely security against adaptive adversaries, that can corrupt parties at any times.\r\nIn this paper we tackle the challenges of designing a post-quantum adap- tively secure threshold signature scheme: starting from the GRASS sig- nature scheme, which is only static secure, we show that it is possible to turn it into an adaptive secure threshold signature that we call GRASS+. In particular, we introduce two variants of the classical GAIP problem and discuss their security. We prove that our protocol is adaptively secure in the Random Oracle Model, if the adversary corrupts only t 2 parties. We are also able to prove that GRASS+ achieves full adaptive security, with a corruption threshold of t, in the Black Box Group Action Model with Random Oracle. Finally, we improve the performance of the scheme by exploiting a better secret sharing, inspired from the work of Desmedt, Di Crescenzo, and Burmester from ASIACRYPT\u201994.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we revisit venerable lower-bounds on the $AT$ or $AT^2$\r\nperformance metric of hardware circuits. A series of works started in the late 1970's has established that if a hardware circuit of area $A$ computes a function $f : \\{0, 1\\}^n \\rightarrow \\{0, 1\\}^m$ in $T$ clock cycles, then $AT^2$ is asymptotically larger than (a form of) the communication complexity of $f$. These lower-bounds ignore the active component of the circuit such as the logic gates and only take into account the area of the wiring.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems that it is common practice to report the performance\r\ncharacteristics of hardware designs after synthesis, namely after having\r\n``compiled'' the design into the topological description of a hardware circuit made of standard cells. The area of the cells can be be determined with certainty, whereas the area occupied by the wires cannot. This may leads to optimistic performance figures, that may even violate the old lower-bounds.\r\n  \r\nIn this paper, we take the case of the M\u00f6bius transform as a case study, following the work of Banik and Regazzoni in TCHES, 2024(2) who presented hardware designs that implement it. We first determine the communication complexity of the M\u00f6bius transform. Then, following the old methodology, we derive lower-bounds on the area (in $\\mu m^2$) of any circuit that implement the operation using several open Process Design Kits for ASIC production. For large enough instances, the wires provably occupy more area than the logic gates themselves. This invalidate previous theoretical claims about the performance of circuits implementing the M\u00f6bius transform.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, the root cause of the contradiction between ``VLSI-era''\r\nlower-bounds and current performance claims is that the lower-bounds apply to  a geometric description of the circuit where the length of wiring is known, while it is common to report performance results on the basis of hardware synthesis alone, where a topological description of the circuit has been obtained but the actual length of wires is unknown.",

    "abstract": "We show that discrete Gaussian sampling for a $q$-ary lattice is equivalent to codeword sampling for a linear code over $\\mathbb{Z}_q$ with the Lee weight. This insight allows us to derive the theta series of a $q$-ary lattice from the Lee weight distribution of the associated code. We design a novel Gaussian sampler for $q$-ary lattices assuming an oracle that computes the symmetrized weight enumerator of the associated code.\r\nWe apply this sampler to well-known lattices, such as the $E_8$, Barnes-Wall, and Leech lattice, highlighting both its advantages and limitations, which depend on the underlying code properties. For certain root lattices, we show that the sampler is indeed efficient, forgoing the need to assume an oracle. We also discuss applications of our results in digital signature schemes and the Lattice Isomorphism Problem. In many cases, our sampler achieves a significant speed-up compared to state-of-the-art sampling algorithms in cryptographic applications.",

    "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies have emerged as a critical medium for digital financial transactions, driving widespread adoption while simultaneously exposing users to escalating fraud risks. The irreversible nature of cryptocurrency transactions, combined with the absence of consumer protection mechanisms, leaves users vulnerable to substantial financial losses and emotional distress. To address these vulnerabilities, we introduce Insured Cryptocurrency Transactions (ICT), a novel decentralized insurance framework designed to ensure financial recovery for honest users affected by fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions. We rigorously formalize the ICT framework, establishing strong security guarantees to protect against malicious adversaries. Furthermore, we present Insured Cryptocurrency Exchange (ICE), a concrete instantiation of ICT tailored for centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. ICE relies primarily on a standard smart contract and provides a robust mechanism to compensate users in cases of security breaches, insolvency, or fraudulent activities affecting the exchange. We have implemented ICE\u2019s smart contract and evaluated its on-chain costs. The evaluation results demonstrate ICE\u2019s low operational overhead. To our knowledge, ICT and ICE represent the first formal approaches to decentralized insurance frameworks in the cryptocurrency domain.",

    "abstract": "We introduce protein cryptography, a recently proposed method that encodes data into the amino acid sequences of proteins. Unlike traditional digital encryption, this approach relies on the inherent diversity, complexity, and replication resistance of biological macromolecules, making them highly secure against duplication or tampering. The experimental realization of protein cryptography remains an open problem. To accelerate experimental progress in this area, we provide an accessible and self-contained introduction to the fundamentals of cryptography for biologists with limited mathematical and computational backgrounds. Furthermore, we outline a framework for encoding, synthesizing, and decoding information using proteins. By enabling biologists to actively engage in the development of protein cryptography, this work bridges disciplinary boundaries and paves the way for applications in secure data storage.",

Its efficiency, both in software and hardware, has been demonstrated for integers commonly used in Elliptic Curve Cryptography. In recent papers, some authors introduce specific prime forms that are particularly well-suited for PMNS arithmetic. In this work, we extend their results to a broader class of prime numbers. In practice, our approach yields performance that is competitive with, and in some cases superior to, Pseudo-Mersenne arithmetic.

    "abstract": "This work explores the application and efficient deployment of (standardized) post-quantum (PQ) digital signature algorithms in the blockchain environment. Specifically, we implement and evaluate four PQ signatures in the Ethereum Virtual Machine: W-OTS$^{+}$, XMSS, SPHINCS+, and MAYO. We focus on optimizing the gas costs of the verification algorithms as that is the signature schemes' only algorithm executed on-chain, thus incurring financial costs (transaction fees) for the users. Hence, the verification algorithm is the signature schemes' main bottleneck for decentralized applications.\r\n\r\nWe examine two methods to verify post-quantum digital signatures on-chain. Our practical performance evaluation shows that full on-chain verification is often prohibitively costly. Naysayer proofs (FC'24) allow a novel optimistic verification mode. We observe that the Naysayer verification mode is generally the cheapest, at the cost of additional trust assumptions. We release our implementation called poqeth as an open-source library.",

    "abstract": "Our main result is a quantum polynomial-time reduction from the group action discrete logarithm (DLP) problem to a specific cloning problem. A consequence of this result is that the public-key quantum money scheme proposed by Zhandry (2024), based on abelian group actions, is secure in the generic group action model. Specifically, our result shows that breaking the quantum money scheme is equivalent, under quantum polynomial-time reductions, to solving the group action DLP. Two immediate implications of our results are: i) A separation between quantum money and quantum lightning. This separation arises because our reduction is non-uniform, and quantum lightning is not secure against non-uniform adversaries. ii) Cloning vs. preparing Fourier states. Our main theorem shows that the problem of cloning group action Fourier states is equivalent to the problem of preparing these states.",

    "abstract": "Data privacy concerns are sharply rising in the current digital era, hyperdriven by cloud computing, big data analytics, and the Internet of Things. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) has emerged as an ideal technique for computing on encrypted data, but current schemes suffer from slow encryption speed and large ciphertext expansion. Practical implementation is hindered, especially when the client has limited bandwidth, memory, and computing power. In 2011, Naehrig et al. proposed transciphering, reducing computational and communication overload on the client side. This involves symmetric ciphers with minimized multiplicative complexity, \r\nreferred to as HE-Friendly Ciphers (HEFCs). \r\n\r\nIn this work, we present a detailed study of transciphering for HE by systematizing existing knowledge and crystallizing research challenges. Particularly we conduct a comprehensive study on state-of-the-art HEFC constructions. Our work highlights gaps, open problems, and directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "Homomorphic secret sharing (HSS) is a distributed analogue of fully-homomorphic encryption (FHE), where subsequent to an input-sharing phase, parties can locally compute a function over their shares to obtain shares of the function output.\r\n\r\nOver the last decade, HSS schemes have been constructed from an array of different assumptions. However, all schemes require a public-key or correlated-randomness setup. This limitation carries over to the applications of HSS.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we construct multi-key homomorphic secret sharing (MKHSS), where given only a common reference string (CRS), two parties can secret share their inputs to each other and then perform local computations as in HSS. We present the first MKHSS schemes supporting all NC1 computations from either the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH), Decisional Composite Residuosity (DCR), or class group assumptions.\r\n\r\nOur constructions imply the following applications in the CRS model:\r\n\r\n- Succinct two-round secure computation. Under the same assumptions as our MKHSS schemes, we construct succinct, two-round secure two-party computation for NC1 circuits. Previously, such a result was only known from the learning with errors assumption.\r\n\r\n- Attribute-based NIKE. Under DCR or class group assumptions, we construct non-interactive key exchange (NIKE) protocols where two parties agree on a key if and only if their secret attributes satisfy a public NC1 predicate. This significantly generalizes the existing notion of password-based NIKE.\r\n\r\n- Public-key PCFs. Under DCR or class group assumptions, we construct public-key pseudorandom correlation functions (PCFs) for any NC1 correlation. This yields the first public-key PCFs for Beaver triples (and more) from non-lattice assumptions.\r\n\r\n- Silent MPC. Under DCR or class group assumptions, we construct a p-party secure computation protocol in the silent preprocessing model where the preprocessing phase has communication O(p), ignoring polynomial factors. All prior protocols that do not rely on spooky encryption require $\u03a9(p^2)$ communication.",

    "abstract": "Distributed Point Functions (DPFs) are a useful cryptographic primitive enabling a dealer to distribute short keys to two parties, such that the keys encode additive secret shares of a secret point function. However, in many applications of DPFs, no single dealer entity has full knowledge of the secret point function, necessitating the parties to run an interactive protocol to emulate the setup. Prior works have aimed to minimize complexity metrics of such distributed setup protocols, e.g., round complexity, while remaining black-box in the underlying cryptography.\r\n\r\nWe construct Non-Interactive DPFs (NIDPF), which have a one-round (simultaneous-message, semi-honest) setup protocol, removing the need for a trusted dealer. Specifically, our construction allows each party to publish a special \"public key\" to a public channel or bulletin board, where the public key encodes the party's secret function parameters. Using the public key of another party, any pair of parties can locally derive a DPF key for the point function parameterized by the two parties' joint inputs.\r\n\r\nWe realize NIDPF from an array of standard assumptions, including DCR, SXDH, QR, and LWE. Each party's public key is of size $O(N^{2/3})$, for point functions with a domain of size $N$, which leads to a sublinear communication setup protocol. The only prior approach to realizing such a non-interactive setup required using multi-key fully-homomorphic encryption or indistinguishability obfuscation.\r\n\r\nAs immediate applications of our construction, we get \"public-key setups\" for several existing constructions of pseudorandom correlation generators and round-efficient protocols for secure comparisons.",

    "abstract": "We put forth and instantiate a new primitive we call simultaneous-message and succinct (SMS) secure computation. An SMS scheme enables a minimal communication pattern for secure computation in the following scenario: Alice has a large private input X, Bob has a small private input y, and Charlie wants to learn $f(X, y)$ for some public function $f$.\r\n\r\nGiven a common reference string (CRS) setup phase, an SMS scheme for a function f is instantiated with two parties holding inputs $X$ and $y$, and has the following structure:\r\n\r\n- The parties simultaneously exchange a single message.\r\n- Communication is succinct, scaling sublinearly in the size of $X$ and the output $f(X, y)$.\r\n- Without further interaction, the parties can locally derive additive secret shares of $f(X, y)$.\r\n\r\nIn this way, an SMS scheme incurs a communication cost that is only twice that of the function output length. Importantly, the size of Alice's message does not grow with the size of her input $X$, and both Alice's and Bob's first-round messages grow sublinearly in the size of the output. Additionally, Alice's or Bob's view provides no information about the other party's input besides the output of $f(X, y)$, even if colluding with Charlie.\r\n\r\nWe obtain the following results:\r\n\r\n- Assuming Learning With Errors (LWE), we build an SMS scheme supporting evaluation of depth-$d$ circuits, where Alice's message is of size $|f(X, y)|^{(2/3)}$\u00b7 poly(\u03bb, d), Bob's message is of size $(|y| + |f(X, y)|^{(2/3)})$ \u00b7 poly(\u03bb, d), and \u03bb is the security parameter. We can further extend this to support all functions by assuming the circular security of LWE.\r\n\r\n- Assuming sub-exponentially secure indistinguishability obfuscation, in conjunction with other standard assumptions, we build an SMS scheme supporting arbitrary polynomial-sized batch functions of the form $(f(x_1, y), ..., f(x_L, y))$, for $X = (x_1, ..., x_L)$. The size of Alice's and Bob's messages in this construction is poly(\u03bb) and poly(\u03bb, |f|, log L), respectively.\r\n\r\nWe show that SMS schemes have several immediate applications. An SMS scheme gives:\r\n\r\n- A direct construction of trapdoor hash functions (TDH) (D\u00f6ttling et al., Crypto'19) for the same class of functions as the one supported by the SMS scheme.\r\n\r\n- A simple and generic compiler for obtaining compact, rate-1 fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) from any non-compact FHE scheme.\r\n\r\n- A simple and generic compiler for obtaining correlation-intractable (CI) hash functions that are secure against all efficiently-searchable relations.\r\n\r\nIn turn, under the LWE assumption, we obtain the first construction of TDH for all functions and generic approaches for obtaining rate-1 FHE and CI hashing. We also show that our iO-based construction gives an alternative approach for two-round secure computation with communication succinctness in the output length (Hub\u00e1\u010dek and Wichs, ITCS'15).",

    "abstract": "Ethereum transitioned from Proof-of-Work consensus to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus in September 2022. While this upgrade brings significant improvements (e.g., lower energy costs and higher throughput), it also introduces new vulnerabilities. One notable example is the so-called malicious \\textit{reorganization attack}. Malicious reorganization denotes an attack in which the Byzantine faulty validators intentionally manipulate the canonical chain so the blocks by honest validators are discarded. By doing so, the faulty validators can gain benefits such as higher rewards, lower chain quality, or even posing a liveness threat to the system. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we show that the majority of the known attacks on Ethereum PoS are some form of reorganization attacks. In practice, most of these attacks can be launched even if the network is synchronous (there exists a known upper bound for message transmission and processing). Different from existing studies that mitigate the attacks in an ad-hoc way, we take a systematic approach and provide an elegant yet efficient solution to reorganization attacks. Our solution is provably secure such that no reorganization attacks can be launched in a synchronous network. In a partially synchronous network, our approach achieves the conventional safety and liveness properties of the consensus protocol. Our evaluation results show that our solution is resilient to five types of reorganization attacks and also highly efficient.",

    "abstract": "We propose a decentralized asset-transfer system that enjoys full privacy: no party can learn the details of a transaction, except for its issuer and its recipient. Furthermore, the recipient is only aware of the amount of the transaction. Our system does not rely on consensus or synchrony assumptions, and therefore, it is responsive, since it runs at the actual network speed. Under the hood, every transaction creates a consumable coin equipped with a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof (NIZK) that confirms that the issuer has sufficient funds without revealing any information about her identity, the recipient's identity, or the payment amount. Moreover, we equip our system with a regulatory enforcement mechanism that can be used to regulate transfer limits or restrict specific addresses from sending or receiving funds, while preserving the system's privacy guarantees.\r\n        \r\nFinally, we report on Paxpay, our implementation of Fully Private Asset Transfer (FPAT) that uses the Gnark library for the NIZKs. In our benchmark, Paxpay exhibits better performance than earlier proposals that either ensure only partial privacy, require some kind of network synchrony or do not implement regulation features. Our system thus reconciles privacy, responsiveness, regulation enforcement and performance.",

    "abstract": "Quantum key leasing, also known as public key encryption with secure key leasing (PKE-SKL),\r\nallows a user to lease a (quantum) secret key to a server for decryption purpose, with the capability of revoking the key afterwards.\r\nIn the pioneering work by Chardouvelis et al (arXiv:2310.14328), a PKE-SKL scheme utilizing classical channels was successfully built upon the noisy trapdoor claw-free (NTCF) family. This approach, however, relies on the superpolynomial hardness of learning with errors (LWE) problem, which could affect both efficiency and security of the scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our work, we demonstrate that the reliance on superpolynomial hardness is unnecessary, and that LWE with polynomial-size modulus is sufficient to achieve the same goal. \r\nOur approach enhances both efficiency and security, thereby improving the practical feasibility of the scheme on near-term quantum devices.\r\nTo accomplish this, we first construct a \\textit{noticeable} NTCF (NNTCF) family with the adaptive hardcore bit property, based on LWE with polynomial-size modulus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the adaptive hardcore bit property based on LWE with polynomial-size modulus, which may be of independent interest.\r\nBuilding on this foundation, we address additional challenges in prior work to construct the first PKE-SKL scheme satisfying the following properties:\r\n(\\textit{i}) the entire protocol utilizes only classical communication, and can also be lifted to support homomorphism.\r\n(\\textit{ii}) the security is solely based on LWE assumption with polynomial-size modulus.\r\n\r\nAs a demonstration of the versatility of our noticeable NTCF, we show that an efficient proof of quantumness protocol can be built upon it. Specifically, our protocol enables a classical verifier to test the quantumness while relying exclusively on the LWE assumption with polynomial-size modulus.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of quantum computers, proofs of quantumness have recently become an interesting and intriguing research direction. However, in all current schemes for proofs of quantumness, quantum provers almost invariably face the risk of being maliciously exploited by classical verifiers. In fact, through malicious strategies in interaction with quantum provers, classical verifiers could solve some instances of hard problems that arise from the specific scheme in use. In other words, malicious verifiers can break some schemes (that quantum provers are not aware of) through interaction with quantum provers. All this is due to the lack of formalization that prevents malicious verifiers from extracting useful information in proofs of quantumness.\r\n\r\nTo address this issue, we formalize zero-knowledge proofs of quantumness. Intuitively, the zero-knowledge property necessitates that the information gained by the classical verifier from interactions with the quantum prover should not surpass what can be simulated using a simulated classical prover interacting with the same verifier. As a result, the new zero-knowledge notion can prevent any malicious verifier from exploiting quantum advantage.\r\nInterestingly, we find that the classical zero-knowledge proof is sufficient to compile some existing proofs of quantumness schemes into zero-knowledge proofs of quantumness schemes.\r\n\r\nDue to some technical reasons, it appears to be more general to require zero-knowledge proof on the verifier side instead of the prover side. Intuitively, this helps to regulate the verifier's behavior from malicious to be honest-but-curious. As a result, both parties will play not only one role in the proofs of quantumness but also the dual role in the classical zero-knowledge proof. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the two principle proofs of quantumness schemes: Shor's factoring-based scheme and learning with errors-based scheme in [Brakerski et al, FOCS, 2018], can be transformed into zero-knowledge proofs of quantumness by requiring an extractable non-interactive zero-knowledge argument on the verifier side. \r\nNotably, the zero-knowledge proofs of quantumness can be viewed as an enhanced security notion for proofs of quantumness. To prevent malicious verifiers from exploiting the quantum device's capabilities or knowledge, it is advisable to transition existing proofs of quantumness schemes to this framework whenever feasible.",

    "abstract": "As cloud-based quantum computing services, such as those offered by D-Wave, become more popular for practical applications, privacy-preserving methods (such as obfuscation) are essential to address data security, privacy, and legal compliance concerns.\r\nSeveral efficient obfuscation methods have been proposed, which do not increase the time complexity of solving the obfuscated problem, for quantum optimization problems. These include {\\em sign reversing}, {\\em variable permutation}, and the combination of both methods assumed to provide greater protection. Unfortunately, sign reversing has already been shown to be insecure. \r\n\r\nWe present two attacks on variable permutation and the combined method, where it is possible to efficiently recover the deobfuscated problem, particularly when given access to the obfuscated problem and its obfuscated solution, as a cloud-based quantum provider would have.\r\nOur attacks are in the context of an optimization problem of cryptanalysis of the Trivium cipher family, but our approach generalizes to other similarly structured problems.\r\n\r\nOur attacks are efficient and practical.\r\nDeobfuscating an optimization problem with \\( n \\) variables obfuscated with the combined method has a complexity of $O(n^2)$ compared to the complexity of $O\\left( n \\cdot n! \\cdot 2^n \\right)$ of the brute force attack.\r\nWe provide an implementation of our attack; using a commodity laptop, our attack using the full Trivium cipher takes less than two minutes if optimized.\r\nWe also present possible countermeasures to mitigate our attacks and bring attention to the need for further development in this area.",

    "abstract": "Skyscraper is a cryptographic permutation published in TCHES 2025, optimized for use in proof systems such as PlonK. This primitive is based on a 10-round Feistel network combining $x^2$ monomials and lookup-based functions to achieve competitive plain performances and efficiency in proof systems supporting lookups. In terms of security, the $x^2$ monomials are supposed to provide security against statistical attacks, while lookups are supposed to provide security against algebraic attacks.\r\n\r\nIn this note, we show that this primitive has a much lower security margin than expected. Using a rebound attack, we find practical truncated differentials on the full permutation. As a corollary, we also find a practical collision attack on the compression function based on a 9-round Skyscraper permutation, which significantly reduces the security margin of the primitive. All of these attacks have been implemented and work in practice.",

    "abstract": "Boolean formula minimization is a notoriously hard problem that is known to be $\\varSigma_2^P$-complete. Circuit minimization, typically studied in the context of a much broader subject known as synthesis and optimization of circuits, introduces another layer of complexity since ultimately those technology-independent epresentations (e.g., Boolean formulas and truth tables) has to be transformed into a netlist of cells of the target technology library. To manage those complexities, the industrial community typically separates the synthesis process into two steps: technology-independent optimization and technology mapping. In each step, this approach only tries to find the local optimal solution and relies heavily on heuristics rather than a systematic search. However, for small S-boxes, a more systematic exploration of the design space is possible. Aiming at the global optimum, we propose a method which can synthesize a truth table for a small S-box directly into a netlist of the cells of a given technology library. Compared with existing technology-dependent synthesis tools like LIGHTER and PEIGEN, our method produces improved results for many S-boxes with respect to circuit area. In particular, by applying our method to the $\\mathbb{F}_{2^4}$-inverter involved in the tower field implementation of the AES S-box, we obtain the currently known lightest implementation of the AES S-box. The search framework can be tweaked to take circuit delay into account. As a result, we find implementations for certain S-boxes with both latency and area improved.",

    "abstract": "Introduced by Halevi, Ishai, Kushilevitz, and Rabin (CRYPTO 2023), Additive randomized encodings (ARE) reduce the computation of a $k$-party function $f(x_1,\\dots,x_k)$ to locally computing encodings $\\hat x_i$ of each input $x_i$ and then adding them together over some Abelian group into an output encoding $\\hat y = \\sum \\hat x_i$, which reveals nothing but the result. The appeal of ARE comes from the simplicity of the non-local computation, involving only addition. This gives rise for instance to non-interactive secure function evaluation in the shuffle model where messages from different parties are anonymously shuffled before reaching their destination. Halevi, Ishai, Kushilevitz, and Rabin constructed ARE based on Diffie-Hellman type assumptions in bilinear groups.\r\n\r\nWe construct ARE assuming public-key encryption. The key insight behind our construction is that one-sided ARE, which only guarantees privacy for one of the parties, are relatively easy to construct, and yet can be lifted to full-fledged ARE. We also give a more efficient black-box construction from the CDH assumption.",

    "abstract": "A memory checking argument enables a prover to prove to a verifier that it is correctly processing reads and writes to memory. They are used widely in modern SNARKs, especially in zkVMs, where the prover proves the correct execution of a CPU including the correctness of memory operations.\r\n\r\nWe describe a new approach for memory checking, which we call the method of one-hot addressing and increments. We instantiate this method via two different families of protocols, called Twist and Shout. Twist supports read/write memories, while Shout targets read-only memories (also known as lookup arguments). Both Shout and Twist have logarithmic verifier costs. Unlike prior works, these protocols do not invoke \"grand product\" or \"grand sum\" arguments.\r\n\r\nTwist and Shout significantly improve the prover costs of prior works across the full range of realistic memory sizes, from tiny memories (e.g., 32 registers as in RISC-V), to memories that are so large they cannot be explicitly materialized (e.g., structured lookup tables of size $2^{64}$ or larger, which arise in Lasso and the Jolt zkVM). Detailed cost analysis shows that Twist and Shout are well over 10x cheaper for the prover than state-of-the-art memory-checking procedures configured to have logarithmic proof length.\r\n\r\nPrior memory-checking procedures can also be configured to have larger proofs. Even then, we estimate that Twist and Shout are at least 2--4x faster for the prover in key applications. \r\n \r\nFinally, using Shout, we provide two fast-prover SNARKs for non-uniform constraint systems, both of which achieve minimal commitment costs (the prover commits only to the witness): (1) SpeedySpartan applies to Plonkish constraints, substantially improving the previous state-of-the-art protocol, BabySpartan; and (2)Spartan++ applies to CCS (a generalization of Plonkish and R1CS), improving prover times over the previous state-of-the-art protocol, Spartan, by 6x.",

    "abstract": "We present a new lattice-based signature scheme, called \u2018NTRU+Sign\u2019, using the Fiat-Shamir with Aborts framework. The proposed scheme is designed based on a novel NTRU-based key structure that fits well with bimodal distributions, enabling efficiency improvements compared to its predecessor, BLISS. The novel NTRU-based key structure is characterized by: (1) effectively changing a modulus from 2q to q, which is different from the existing usage of 2q for bimodal distributions, and (2) drastically reducing the magnitude of a secret key, which directly leads to compactness of signature sizes. We provide two concrete parameter sets for NTRU+Sign, supporting 93-bit and 211-bit security levels. Using the technique from GALACTICS (that was suggested as the constant-time implementation of BLISS),\r\nour analysis shows that NTRU+Sign achieves a good balance between computational efficiency and signature compactness, with constant-time implementation. For instance, at the NIST-3 security level, NTRU+Sign produces signatures that are significantly smaller than Dilithium and HAETAE, while providing faster verification speeds. These advantages position NTRU+Sign as a competitive and practical\r\nsolution for real-world deployments.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents dCTIDH, a CSIDH implementation that combines two recent developments into a novel state-of-the-art deterministic implementation. We combine the approach of deterministic variants of CSIDH with the batching strategy of CTIDH, which shows that the full potential of this key space has not yet been explored. This high-level adjustment in itself leads to a significant speed-up. To achieve an effective deterministic evaluation in constant time, we introduce Wombats, a new approach to performing isogenies in batches, specifically tailored to the behavior required for deterministic CSIDH using CTIDH batching. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, we explore the two-dimensional space of optimal primes for dCTIDH, with regard to both the performance of dCTIDH in terms of finite-field operations per prime and the efficiency of finite-field operations, determined by the prime shape, in terms of cycles. This allows us to optimize both for choice of prime and scheme parameters simultaneously. Lastly, we implement and benchmark constant-time, deterministic dCTIDH. Our results show that dCTIDH not only outperforms state-of-the-art deterministic CSIDH, but even non-deterministic CTIDH: dCTIDH-2048 is faster than CTIDH-2048 by 17 percent, and is almost five times faster than dCSIDH-2048.",

    "abstract": "The adoption of Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Secure\r\nFunction Evaluation (SFE) applications in the real world remains lim-\r\nited, even nearly 50 years after the introduction of HE. This is particu-\r\nlarly unfortunate given the strong privacy and confidentiality guarantees\r\nthese tools can offer to modern digital life.\r\nWhile attempting to incorporate a simple straw-man PSI protocol into\r\na web service for matching individuals based on their profiles, we en-\r\ncountered several shortcomings in current outsourcing frameworks. Ex-\r\nisting outsourced protocols either require clients to perform tasks beyond\r\nmerely contributing their inputs or rely on a non-collusion assumption\r\nbetween a server and a client, which appears implausible in standard web\r\nservice scenarios.\r\nTo address these issues, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first\r\ngeneral construction for non-interactive outsourced computation based\r\non black-box homomorphic encryption. This approach relies on a non-\r\ncollusion assumption between two dedicated servers, which we consider\r\nmore realistic in a web-service setting. Furthermore, we provide a proof\r\nof our construction within the Universal Composability (UC) framework,\r\nassuming semi-honest (i.e., passive) adversaries.\r\nUnlike general one-sided two-party SFE protocols, our construction addi-\r\ntionally requires sender privacy. Specifically, the sender must contribute\r\nits inputs solely in encrypted form. This ensures stronger privacy guar-\r\nantees and broadens the applicability of the protocol.\r\nOverall, the range of applications for our construction includes all one-\r\nsided two-party sender-private SFE protocols as well as server-based\r\narithmetic computations on encrypted inputs. Finally, we demonstrate\r\nthe practical applicability of our general outsourced computation frame-\r\nwork by applying it to the specific use case of Outsourced Private Set\r\nIntersection (OPSI) in a real-world scenario, accompanied by a detailed\r\nevaluation of its efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Homomorphic signatures for NP (HSNP) allow proving that a signed value is the result of a non-deterministic computation on signed inputs. At CCS'22, Fiore and Tucker introduced HSNP, showed how to use them for verifying arbitrary computations on data streams, and proposed a generic HSNP construction obtained by efficiently combining zkSNARKs with linearly homomorphic signatures (LHS), namely those supporting linear functions. Their proposed LHS however suffered from an high verification cost. In this work we propose an efficient LHS that significantly improves on previous work in terms of verification time. Using the modular approach of Fiore and Tucker, this yields a verifier-efficient HSNP. We show that the HSNP instantiated with our LHS is particularly suited to the case when the data is taken from consecutive samples, which captures important use cases including sliding window statistics such as variances, histograms and stock market predictions.",

    "abstract": "Twisted generalized Reed-Solomon (TGRS) codes constitute an interesting family of evaluation codes, containing a large class of maximum distance separable codes non-equivalent to generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) ones.\r\nMoreover, the Schur squares of TGRS codes may be much larger than those of GRS codes with same dimension.\r\nExploiting these structural differences, in 2018, Beelen, Bossert, Puchinger and Rosenkilde proposed a subfamily of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) Twisted Reed--Solomon (TRS) codes over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ with $\\ell$ twists $q \\approx n^{2^{\\ell}}$ for McEliece encryption, claiming their resistance to both Sidelnikov Shestakov attack and\r\nSchur products--based attacks. In short, they claimed these codes to resist to classical key recovery attacks on McEliece encryption scheme instantiated with Reed-Solomon (RS) or GRS codes. In 2020, Lavauzelle and Renner presented an original attack on this system based on the computation of the subfield subcode of the public TRS code.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we show that the original claim on the resistance of TRS and TGRS codes to Schur products based--attacks is wrong.\r\nWe identify a broad class of codes including TRS and TGRS ones that is distinguishable from random by computing the Schur square\r\nof some shortening of the code. Then, we focus on the case of single twist ({i.e.}, $\\ell = 1$), which is the most efficient one in terms of decryption complexity, to derive an attack. The technique is similar to the distinguisher-based attacks of RS code-based systems given by Couvreur, Gaborit, Gauthier-Uma\u00f1a, Otmani, Tillich in 2014.",

    "abstract": "The Stealth Address Protocol (SAP) allows users to receive assets through stealth addresses that are unlinkable to their stealth meta-addresses. The most widely used SAP, Dual-Key SAP (DKSAP), and the most performant SAP, Elliptic Curve Pairing Dual-Key SAP (ECPDKSAP), are based on elliptic curve cryptography, which is vulnerable to quantum attacks. These protocols depend on the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem, which could be efficiently solved on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer using the Shor algorithm. In this paper three novel post-quantum SAPs based on lattice-based cryptography are presented: LWE SAP, Ring-LWE SAP and Module-LWE SAP. These protocols leverage Learning With Errors (LWE) problem to ensure quantum-resistant privacy. Among them, Module-LWE SAP, which is based on the Kyber key encapsulation mechanism, achieves the best performance and outperforms ECPDKSAP by approximately 66.8% in the scan time of the ephemeral public key registry.",

    "abstract": "We propose efficient, post-quantum threshold ring signatures constructed from one-wayness of AES encryption and the VOLE-in-the-Head zero-knowledge proof system. Our scheme scales efficiently to large rings and extends the linkable ring signatures paradigm. We define and construct key-binding deterministic tags for signature linkability, that also enable succinct aggregation with approximate lower bound arguments of knowledge; this allows us to achieve succinct aggregation of our signatures without SNARKs. Finally, we extend our threshold ring signatures to realize post-quantum anonymous ledger transactions in the spirit of Monero. Our constructions assume symmetric key primitives only. \r\nWhilst it is common to build post-quantum signatures from the one-wayness property of AES and a post-quantum NIZK scheme, we extend this paradigm to define and construct novel security properties from AES that are useful for advanced signature applications. We introduce key-binding and pseudorandomness of AES to establish linkability and anonymity of our threshold ring signatures from deterministic tags, and similarly establish binding and hiding properties of block ciphers modeled as ideal permutations to build commitments from AES, a crucial building block for our proposed post-quantum anonymous ledger scheme.",

    "abstract": "We construct the first tightly secure signature schemes in the multi-user setting with adaptive corruptions from classical discrete logarithm, RSA,  factoring, or post-quantum group action discrete logarithm assumption. In contrast to our scheme, the previous tightly secure schemes are based on the decisional assumption (e.g., (group action) DDH) or interactive search assumptions (e.g., one-more CDH). \r\nThe security of our schemes is independent of the number of users, signing queries, and RO queries, and forging our signatures is as hard as solving the underlying search problem. Our starting point is an identification scheme with multiple secret keys per public key (e.g., Okamoto identification (CRYPTO'92) and parallel-OR identification (CRYPTO'94)). This property allows a reduction to solve a search problem while answering corruption queries for all users in the signature security game. To convert such an identification scheme into a signature scheme tightly, we employ randomized Fischlin's transformation introduced by Kondi and shelat (Asiacrypt 2022) that provides straight-line extraction. Intuitively, the transformation properties guarantee the tight security of our signature scheme in the programmable random oracle model, but we successfully prove its tight security in the non-programmable random oracle model.",

    "abstract": "CROSS is a post-quantum secure digital signature scheme submitted to NIST\u2019s Call for Additional Signatures which was recently selected for round 2. It features signature and key sizes in the range of SLH-DSA while providing a substantially faster signing operation. Within this work, we provide the first passive side-channel attack on the scheme. The attack recovers the secret key from all except one parameter sets from a single power trace while requiring at maximum two power traces for the R-SDP(G) 1 Fast instance. To successfully mount the attack, we show how to recover the secret key from side-channel information gained from the syndrome computation in CROSS\u2019 identification protocol. We furthermore show how the hypothesis space for the attack can be restricted using information from the published signature.",

    "abstract": "Post-quantum signatures have high costs compared to RSA and ECDSA, in particular for smart cards. A line of work originating from Even, Goldreich, and Micali (CRYPTO'89) aimed to reduce digital signature latency by splitting up signing into an online and offline phase. The online/offline paradigm combines an ordinary long-term signature scheme with a fast, generally one-time, signature scheme. We reconsider this paradigm in the context of lattice-based post-quantum signatures in the GPV framework, with an example instantiation based on Falcon.",

    "abstract": "The Fiat-Shamir (FS) transform is a prolific and powerful technique for compiling public-coin interactive protocols into non-interactive ones. Roughly speaking, the idea is to replace the random coins of the verifier with the evaluations of a complex hash function.\r\n    \r\nThe FS  transform is known to be sound in the random oracle model (i.e., when the hash function is modeled as a totally random function). However, when instantiating the random oracle using a concrete hash function, there are examples of  protocols in which the transformation is not sound. So far all of these examples have been contrived protocols that were specifically designed to fail.\r\n\r\nIn this work we show such an attack for a standard and popular interactive succinct argument, based on the GKR protocol, for verifying the correctness of a non-determinstic bounded-depth computation. For every choice of FS hash function, we show that a corresponding instantiation of this protocol, which was been widely studied in the literature and used also in practice, is not (adaptively) sound when compiled with the FS transform. Specifically, we construct an explicit circuit for which we can generate an accepting proof for a false statement.\r\n    \r\nWe further extend our attack and show that for every circuit $C$ and desired output $y$, we can construct a functionally equivalent circuit $C^*$, for which we can produce an accepting proof that $C^*$ outputs $y$ (regardless of whether or not this statement is true). This demonstrates that any security guarantee (if such exists) would have to depend on the specific implementation of the circuit $C$, rather than just its functionality.\r\n\r\nLastly, we also demonstrate versions of the attack that violate non-adaptive soundness of the protocol -- that is, we generate an attacking circuit that is independent of the underlying cryptographic objects. However, these versions are either less practical (as the attacking circuit has very large depth) or make some additional (reasonable) assumptions on the underlying cryptographic primitives.",

    "abstract": "PAKE protocols are used to establish secure communication channels using a relatively short, often human memorable, password for authentication. The currently standardized PAKEs however rely on classical asymmetric (public key) cryptography. Thus, these classical PAKEs may no longer maintain their security, should the expected quantum threat become a reality. Unlike prominent security protocols such as TLS, IKEv2 and VPN, quantum-safe PAKEs did not receive much attention from the ongoing PQC integration efforts. Thus, there is a significant gap in awareness compared to PQC schemes that are subject to the official governmental and institutional standardization processes. In the work at hand, we provide a comprehensive overview of the existing PQC PAKEs focusing on their design rationales, authentication methods and used asymmetric key agreement primitives. We highlight their performance and properties as per their assumed security assurances and practical usage in applications. Moreover, we address PAKE designs that are still non-present in the PQC realm and discuss the possibility of their adaptation. Thus, we offer a detailed reference and derive future work for quantum-safe PAKEs.",

    "abstract": "The Module Learning with Errors ($\\mathsf{MLWE}$) problem is one of the most commonly used hardness assumption in lattice-based cryptography. In its standard version, a matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is sampled uniformly at random over a quotient ring $R_q$, as well as noisy linear equations in the form of $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{s}+ \\mathbf{e} \\bmod q$, where $\\mathbf{s}$ is the secret, sampled uniformly at random over $R_q$, and $\\mathbf{e}$ is the error, coming from a Gaussian distribution.  Many previous works have focused on variants of $\\mathsf{MLWE}$, where the secret and/or the error are sampled from different distributions. Only few works have focused on different distributions for the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$. One variant proposed in the literature is to consider matrix distributions where the low-order bits of a uniform $\\mathbf{A}$ are deleted. This seems a natural approach in order to save in bandwidth. We call it truncated $\\mathsf{MLWE}$.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we show that the hardness of standard $\\mathsf{MLWE}$ implies the hardness of truncated $\\mathsf{MLWE}$, both for search and decision versions. Prior works only covered the search variant and relied on the (module) $\\mathsf{NTRU}$ assumption, limitations which we are able to overcome. Overall, we provide two approaches, offering different advantages. The first uses a general R\u00e9nyi divergence argument, applicable to a wide range of secret/error distributions, but which only works for the search variants of (truncated) $\\mathsf{MLWE}$. The second applies to the decision versions, by going through an intermediate variant of $\\mathsf{MLWE}$, where additional hints on the secret are given to the adversary. However, the reduction makes use of discrete Gaussian distributions.",

    "abstract": "In a single secret leader election (SSLE) protocol, all parties collectively and obliviously elect one leader. No one else should learn its identity unless it reveals itself as the leader. The problem is first formalized by Boneh \\textit{et al.} (AFT'20), which proposes an efficient construction based on the Decision Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption. Considering the potential risk of quantum computers, several follow-ups focus on designing a post-quantum secure SSLE protocol based on pure lattices or fully homomorphic encryption. However, no concrete benchmarks demonstrate the feasibility of deploying such heavy cryptographic primitives.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we present Qelect, the first practical constant-round post-quantum secure SSLE protocol. We first adapt the commitment scheme in Boneh \\textit{et al.} (AFT'23) into a \\textit{multi-party randomizable commitment} scheme, and propose our novel construction based on an adapted version of ring learning with errors (RLWE) problem. We then use it as a building block and construct a \\textit{constant-round} single secret leader election (crSSLE) scheme. We utilize the single instruction multiple data (SIMD) property of a specific threshold fully homomorphic encryption (tFHE) scheme to evaluate our election circuit efficiently. Finally, we built Qelect from the crSSLE scheme, with performance optimizations including a preprocessing phase to amortize the local computation runtime and a retroactive detection phase to avoid the heavy zero-knowledge proofs during the election phase. Qelect achieves asymptotic improvements and is concretely practical. We implemented a prototype of Qelect and evaluated its performance in a WAN. Qelect is at least two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we report on the latest GPU implementations of the three well-known methods for the key switching operation, which is critical for Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). Additionally, for the first time in the literature, we provide implementations of all three methods in GPU for leveled CKKS schemes. To ensure a fair comparison, we employ the most recent GPU implementation of the number-theoretic transform (NTT), which is the most time-consuming operation in key switching, and evaluate the performance across two fully homomorphic schemes: BFV and CKKS. Furthermore, we highlight the advantages and shortcomings of the three methods in the context of leveled HE schemes, and discuss other aspects such as memory requirements. Our GPU implementation is integrated with HEonGPU Library and delivers up to a \u00d7380 improvement in execution time compared to the Microsoft SEAL Library. Since key switching is a specialized form of the external product common in many HE schemes, our results are directly relevant to time-intensive homomorphic operations such as relinearization and rotation. As homomorphic rotation is one of the most dominant operations in bootstrapping, our results are also applicable in bootstrapping algorithms of BFV, BGV and CKKS schemes.",

    "abstract": "The Classical Bloom Filter (CBF) is a class of Probabilistic Data Structures (PDS) for handling Approximate Query Membership (AMQ). The Learned Bloom Filter (LBF) is a recently proposed class of PDS that combines the Classical Bloom Filter with a Learning Model while preserving the Bloom Filter's one-sided error guarantees. Bloom Filters have been used in settings where inputs are sensitive and need to be private in the presence of an adversary with access to the Bloom Filter through an API or in the presence of an adversary who has access to the internal state of the Bloom Filter. Prior work has investigated the privacy of the Classical Bloom Filter providing attacks and defenses under various privacy definitions. In this work, we formulate a stronger differential privacy-based model for the Bloom Filter. We propose constructions of the Classical and Learned Bloom Filter that satisfy $(\\epsilon, 0)$-differential privacy. This is also the first work that analyses and addresses the privacy of the Learned Bloom Filter under any rigorous model, which is an open problem.",

    "abstract": "With the development of decentralized identity (DID), anonymous credential (AC) technology, as well as its traceability, is receiving more and more attention. Most works introduce a trusted party (regulator) that holds a decryption key or backdoor to directly deanonymize the user identity of anonymous authentication. While some cryptographic primitives can help regulators handle complex tracing tasks among large amounts of user profiles (stored by the issuer) and authentication records (stored by the service provider), additional security primitives are still needed to ensure the privacy of other users. Besides, hardware-binding anonymous credential (hbAC) systems have been proposed to prevent credential sharing or address platform resource constraints, the traceability of hbAC has yet to be discussed.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce a public key encryption with equality test as a regulatory text for each authentication record to address the above-mentioned challenges. The security of this feature is guaranteed by the verifiability, non-frameability, and round isolation of the proposed scheme. We compared the asymptotic complexity of our scheme with other traceable AC schemes and shows our scheme has advantages in tracing tasks as well as securely outsourcing them. The key feature of our scheme is that the ability of equality test of regulatory texts is independent of the public key, but rather depends on the round identifier of the authentication. We instantiate a traceable, hardware-binding AC scheme based on smart cards and BBS+ signature and give the performance analysis of it.",

    "abstract": "Signature schemes from multi-round interactive proofs are becoming increasingly relevant in post-quantum cryptography. A prominent example is CROSS, recently admitted to the second round of the NIST on-ramp standardisation process for post-quantum digital signatures. While the security of these constructions relies on the Fiat-Shamir transform, in the case of CROSS the use of the fixed-weight parallel-repetition optimisation makes the security analysis fuzzier than usual. A recent work has shown that the fixed-weight parallel repetition of a multi-round interactive proof is still knowledge sound, but no matching result appears to be known for the non-interactive version.\r\nIn this paper we provide two main results. First, we explicitly prove the EUF-CMA security of CROSS, filling a gap in the literature. We do this by showing that, in general, the Fiat-Shamir transform of an HVZK and knowledge-sound multi-round interactive proof is EUF-CMA secure. Second, we present a novel forgery attack on signatures obtained from fixed-weight repetitions of 5-round interactive proofs, substantially improving upon a previous attack on parallel repetitions due to Kales and Zaverucha. Our new attack has particular relevance for CROSS, as it shows that several parameter sets achieve a significantly lower security level than claimed, with reductions up to 24% in the worst case.",

    "abstract": "We present the first complete asynchronous MPC protocols for the YOSO (You Speak Only Once) setting. Our protocols rely on threshold additively homomorphic Paillier encryption and are adaptively secure. We rely on the paradigm of Blum et al. (TCC `20) in order to recursively refresh the setup needed for running future steps of YOSO MPC, but replace any use of heavy primitives such as threshold fully homomorphic encryption in their protocol with more efficient alternatives. In order to obtain an efficient YOSO MPC protocol, we also revisit the consensus layer upon which our protocol is built. To this end, we present a novel total-order broadcast protocol with subquadratic communication complexity in the total number $M$ of parties in the network and whose complexity is optimal in the message length. This improves on recent work of Banghale et al. (ASIACRYPT `22) by giving a simplified and more efficient broadcast extension protocol for the asynchronous setting that avoids the use of cryptographic accumulators.",

    "abstract": "We construct the first polynomial commitment scheme (PCS) that has a transparent setup, quasi-linear prover time,  $\\log N$ verifier time, and $\\log \\log N$ proof size, for multilinear polynomials of size $N$. Concretely, we have the smallest proof size amongst transparent PCS, with proof size less than $4.5$KB for $N\\leq 2^{30}$. We prove that our scheme is secure entirely under falsifiable assumptions about groups of unknown order. The scheme significantly improves on the prior work of Dew (PKC 2023), which has super-cubic prover time and relies on the Generic Group Model (a non-falsifiable assumption). Along the way, we make several contributions that are of independent interest: PoKEMath, a protocol for efficiently proving that an arbitrary predicate over committed integer vectors holds; SIPA, a bulletproofs-style inner product argument in groups of unknown order; we also distill out what prior work required from the Generic Group Model and frame this as a falsifiable assumption.",

    "abstract": "The symmetric binary perceptron ($\\mathrm{SBP}_{\\kappa}$) problem with parameter $\\kappa : \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq1} \\to [0,1]$ is an average-case search problem defined as follows: given a random Gaussian matrix $\\mathbf{A} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)^{n \\times m}$ as input where $m \\geq n$, output a vector $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\{-1,1\\}^m$ such that $$|| \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x} ||_{\\infty} \\leq \\kappa(m/n) \\cdot \\sqrt{m}~.$$\r\nThe number partitioning problem ($\\mathrm{NPP}_{\\kappa}$) corresponds to the special case of setting $n=1$. There is considerable evidence that both problems exhibit large computational-statistical gaps.\r\n    \r\nIn this work, we show (nearly) tight average-case hardness for these problems, assuming the worst-case hardness of standard approximate shortest vector problems on lattices.\r\n\r\nFor $\\mathrm{SBP}_\\kappa$, statistically, solutions exist with $\\kappa(x) = 2^{-\\Theta(x)}$ (Aubin, Perkins and Zdeborova, Journal of Physics 2019). For large $n$, the best that efficient algorithms have been able to achieve is a far cry from the statistical bound, namely $\\kappa(x) = \\Theta(1/\\sqrt{x})$ (Bansal and Spencer, Random Structures and Algorithms 2020). The problem has been extensively studied in the TCS and statistics communities, and Gamarnik, Kizildag, Perkins and Xu (FOCS 2022) conjecture that Bansal-Spencer is tight: namely, $\\kappa(x) = \\widetilde{\\Theta}(1/\\sqrt{x})$ is the optimal value achieved by computationally efficient algorithms. \r\n        \r\nWe prove their conjecture assuming the worst-case hardness of approximating the shortest vector problem on lattices.\r\n\r\nFor $\\mathrm{NPP}_\\kappa$, statistically, solutions exist with $\\kappa(m) = \\Theta(2^{-m})$ (Karmarkar, Karp, Lueker and Odlyzko, Journal of Applied Probability 1986). Karmarkar and Karp's classical differencing algorithm achieves $\\kappa(m) = 2^{-O(\\log^2 m)}~.$\r\n        \r\nWe prove that Karmarkar-Karp is nearly tight: namely, no polynomial-time algorithm can achieve $\\kappa(m) = 2^{-\\Omega(\\log^3 m)}$, once again assuming the  worst-case subexponential hardness of approximating the shortest vector problem on lattices to within a subexponential factor.\r\n\r\nOur hardness results are versatile, and hold with respect to different distributions of the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ (e.g., i.i.d. uniform entries from $[0,1]$) and weaker requirements on the solution vector $\\mathbf{x}$.",

    "abstract": "Security models provide a way of formalising security properties in a rigorous way, but it is sometimes difficult to ensure that the model really fits the concept that we are trying to formalise. In this paper, we illustrate this fact by showing the discrepancies between the security model of anonymity of linkable ring signatures and the security that is actually expected for this kind of signature. These signatures allow a user to sign anonymously within an ad hoc group generated from the public keys of the group members, but all their signatures can be linked together. Reading the related literature, it seems obvious that users' identities must remain hidden even when their signatures are linked, but we show that, surprisingly, almost none have adopted a security model that guarantees it. We illustrate this by presenting two counter-examples which are secure in most anonymity model of linkable ring signatures, but which trivially leak a signer's identity after only two signatures.\r\n\r\n  A natural fix to this model, already introduced in some previous work, is proposed in a corruption model where the attacker can generate the keys of certain users themselves, which seems much more coherent in a context where the group of users can be constructed in an ad hoc way at the time of signing. We believe that these two changes make the security model more realistic. Indeed, within the framework of this model, our counter-examples becomes insecure. Furthermore, we show that most of the schemes in the literature we surveyed appear to have been designed to achieve the security guaranteed by the latest model, which reinforces the idea that the model is closer to the informal intuition of what anonymity should be in linkable ring signatures.",

    "abstract": "A private-information-retrieval (PIR) scheme lets a client fetch a record from a remote database without revealing which record it fetched. Classic PIR schemes treat all database records the same but, in practice, some database records are much more popular (i.e., commonly fetched) than others. We introduce distributional private information retrieval, a new type of PIR that can run faster than classic PIR\u2013both asymptotically and concretely\u2013when the popularity distribution is heavily skewed. Distributional PIR provides exactly the same cryptographic privacy as classic PIR. The speedup comes from a relaxed form of correctness: distributional PIR guarantees that in-distribution queries succeed with good probability, while out-of-distribution queries succeed with lower probability.\r\n\r\nWe construct a distributional-PIR scheme that makes black-box use of classic PIR protocols, and prove a lower bound on the server-runtime of a large class of distributional-PIR schemes. On two real-world popularity distributions, our distributional-PIR construction reduces compute costs by $5$-$77\\times$ compared to existing techniques. Finally, we build CrowdSurf, an end-to-end system for privately fetching tweets, and show that distributional-PIR reduces the end-to-end server cost by $8\\times$.",

    "abstract": "BFT protocols usually have a waterfall-like degradation in performance in the face of crash faults. Some BFT protocols may not experience sudden performance degradation under crash faults. They achieve this at the expense of increased communication and round complexity in fault-free scenarios. In a nutshell, existing protocols lack the adaptability needed to perform optimally under varying conditions.\r\n\r\nWe propose TockOwl, the first asynchronous consensus protocol with fault adaptability. TockOwl features quadratic communication and constant round complexity, allowing it to remain efficient in fault-free scenarios. TockOwl also possesses crash robustness, enabling it to maintain stable performance when facing crash faults. These properties collectively ensure the fault adaptability of TockOwl.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we propose TockOwl+ that has network adaptability. TockOwl+ incorporates both fast and slow tracks and employs hedging delays, allowing it to achieve low latency comparable to partially synchronous protocols without waiting for timeouts in asynchronous environments. Compared to the latest dual-track protocols, the slow track of TockOwl+ is simpler, implying shorter latency in fully asynchronous environments.",

    "abstract": "The problem of computing an isogeny of large prime degree from a supersingular elliptic curve of unknown endomorphism ring is assumed to be hard both for classical as well as quantum computers.\r\nIn this work, we first build a two-round identification protocol whose security reduces to this problem.  The challenge consists of a random large prime $q$ and the prover simply replies with an efficient representation of an isogeny of degree $q$ from its public key.\r\nUsing the hash-and-sign paradigm, we then derive a signature scheme with a very simple and flexible signing procedure and prove its security in the standard model.\r\nOur optimized C implementation of the signature scheme shows that signing is roughly $1.8\\times$ faster than all SQIsign variants, whereas verification is $1.4\\times$ times slower.  The sizes of the public key and signature are comparable to existing schemes.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the algorithmic problem of computing isomorphisms between products of supersingular elliptic curves, given their endomorphism rings. This computational problem seems to be difficult when the domain and codomain are fixed, whereas we provide efficient algorithms to compute isomorphisms when part of the codomain is built during the construction. We propose an authentication protocol whose security relies on this asymmetry. Its most prominent feature is that the endomorphism rings of the elliptic curves are not hidden. Furthermore, it does not require a trusted setup.",

It contains a novel modular multiplication design for modular multiplication with a constant for a constant modulus. This modular multiplication design does not require any DSP units or any dedicated multiplier unit, nor does it require extra logic whencompared to the state-of-the-art modular multipliers. Furthermore, we present an implementation of a constant multiplier Number Theoretic Transform design for TFHE-like schemes. Lastly, we use this Number Theoretic Transform design to implement a FINAL hardware accelerator for the AMD Alveo U55c which improves the Throughput metric of TFHE-like cryptosystems on FPGAs by a factor 9.28x over Li et al.'s NFP CHES 2024 accelerator and by 10-25% over the absolute state-of-the-art design FPT while using one third of FPTs DSPs.",

    "abstract": "In modern cryptography, relatively few instantiations of foundational cryptographic primitives are used across most cryptographic protocols. For example, elliptic curve groups are typically instantiated using P-256, P-384, Curve25519, or Curve448, while block ciphers are commonly instantiated with AES, and hash functions with SHA-2, SHA-3, or SHAKE. This limited diversity raises concerns that an adversary with nation-state-level resources could perform a preprocessing attack, generating a hint that might later be exploited to break protocols built on these primitives. It is often notoriously challenging to analyze and upper bound the advantage of a preprocessing attacker even if we assume that we have idealized instantiations of our cryptographic primitives (ideal permutations, ideal ciphers, random oracles, generic groups). Coretti et al. (CRYPTO/EUROCRYPT'18) demonstrated a powerful framework to simplify the analysis of preprocessing attacks, but they only proved that their framework applies when the cryptographic protocol uses a single idealized primitive. In practice, however, cryptographic constructions often utilize multiple different cryptographic primitives. \r\n\r\nWe verify that Coretti et al. (CRYPTO/EUROCRYPT'18)'s framework extends to settings with multiple idealized primitives and we apply this framework to analyze the multi-user security of (short) Schnorr Signatures and the CCA-security of PSEC-KEM against pre-processing attackers in the Random Oracle Model (ROM) plus the Generic Group Model (GGM). Prior work of Blocki and Lee (EUROCRYPT'22) used complicated compression arguments to analyze the security of {\\em key-prefixed} short Schnorr signatures where the random oracle is salted with the user's public key. However, the security analysis did not extend to standardized implementations of Schnorr Signatures (e.g., BSI-TR-03111 or ISO/IEC 14888-3) which do not adopt key-prefixing, but take other measures to protect against preprocessing attacks by disallowing signatures that use a preimage of $0$.  Blocki and Lee (EUROCRYPT'22) left the (in)security of such \"nonzero Schnorr Signature\" constructions as an open question. We fully resolve this open question demonstrating that (short) nonzero Schnorr Signatures are also secure against preprocessing attacks. We also analyze PSEC-KEM in the ROM+GGM demonstrating that this Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) is CPA-secure against preprocessing attacks.",

    "abstract": "The rise of 5G and IoT has shifted secure communication from centralized and homogeneous to a landscape of heterogeneous mobile devices constantly travelling between myriad networks. In such environments, it is desirable for devices to securely extend their connection from one network to another, often referred to as a handover. In this work we introduce the first cryptographic formalisation of secure handover schemes. We leverage our formalisation to propose path privacy, a novel security property for handovers that has hitherto remained unexplored. We further develop a syntax for secure handovers, and identify security properties appropriate for secure handover schemes. Finally, we introduce a generic handover scheme that captures all the strong notions of security we have identified, combining our novel path privacy concept with other security properties characteristic to existing handover schemes, demonstrating the robustness and versatility of our framework.",

    "abstract": "Everlasting (EL) privacy offers an attractive solution to the Store-Now-Decrypt-Later (SNDL) problem, where future increases in the attacker's capability could break systems which are believed to be secure today. Instead of requiring full information-theoretic security, everlasting privacy allows computationally-secure transmissions of ephemeral secrets, which are only \"effective\" for a limited periods of time, after which their compromise is provably useless for the SNDL attacker.\r\n\r\nIn this work we revisit such everlasting privacy model of Dodis and Yeo (ITC'21), which we call Hypervisor EverLasting Privacy (HELP). HELP is a novel architecture for generating shared randomness using a network of semi-trusted servers (or \"hypervisors\"), trading the need to store/distribute large shared secrets with the assumptions that it is hard to: (a) simultaneously compromise too many publicly accessible ad-hoc servers; and (b) break a computationally-secure encryption scheme very quickly. While Dodis and Yeo presented good HELP solutions in the asymptotic sense, their solutions were concretely expensive and used heavy tools (like large finite fields or gigantic Toeplitz matrices). \r\n\r\nWe abstract and generalize the HELP architecture to allow for more efficient instantiations, and construct several concretely efficient HELP solutions. Our solutions use elementary cryptographic operations, such as hashing and message authentication. We also prove a very strong composition theorem showing that our EL architecture can use any message transmission method which is computationally-secure in the Universal Composability (UC) framework. This is the first positive composition result for everlasting privacy, which was otherwise known to suffer from many \"non-composition\" results (M\u00fcller-Quade and Unruh; J of Cryptology'10).",

    "abstract": "Timed cryptography has initiated a paradigm shift in the design of cryptographic protocols: Using timed cryptography we can realize tasks fairly, which is provably out of range of standard cryptographic concepts. To a certain degree, the success of timed cryptography is rooted in the existence of efficient protocols based on the sequential squaring assumption.\r\n\r\n    In this work, we consider space analogues of timed cryptographic primitives, which we refer to as space-hard primitives. Roughly speaking, these notions require honest protocol parties to invest a certain amount of space and provide security against space constrained adversaries. While inefficient generic constructions of timed-primitives from strong assumptions such as indistinguishability obfuscation can be adapted to the space-hard setting, we currently lack concrete and versatile algebraically structured assumptions for space-hard cryptography.\r\n \r\n    In this work, we initiate the study of space-hard primitives from concrete algebraic assumptions relating to the problem of root-finding of sparse polynomials. Our motivation to study this problem is a candidate construction of VDFs by Boneh et al. (CRYPTO 2018) which are based on the hardness of inverting permutation polynomials. Somewhat anticlimactically, our first contribution is a full break of this candidate. However, we then revise this hardness assumption by dropping the permutation requirement and considering arbitrary sparse high degree polynomials. We argue that this type of assumption is much better suited for space-hardness rather than timed cryptography. We then proceed to construct both space-lock puzzles and verifiable space-hard functions from this assumption.",

    "abstract": "We present hax, a verification toolchain for Rust targeted at security-critical software such as cryptographic libraries, protocol imple- mentations, authentication and authorization mechanisms, and parsing and sanitization code. The key idea behind hax is the pragmatic observation that different verification tools are better at handling different kinds of verification goals. Consequently, hax supports multiple proof backends, including domain-specific security analysis tools like ProVerif and SSProve, as well as general proof assistants like Coq and F*. In this paper, we present the hax toolchain and show how we use it to translate Rust code to the input languages of different provers. We describe how we systematically test our translated models and our models of the Rust system libraries to gain confidence in their correctness. Finally, we briefly overview various ongoing verification projects that rely on hax.",

    "abstract": "We translate the expand-and-extract framework by Fitzi, Liu-Zhang, and Loss (PODC 21) to the asynchronous setting.\r\nWhile they use it to obtain a synchronous BA with $2^{-\\lambda}$ error probability in $\\lambda+1$ rounds, we make it work in asynchrony in $\\lambda+3$ rounds. At the heart of their solution is a generalization of crusader agreement and graded agreement to any number of grades called proxcensus. They achieve graded consensus with $2^r+1$ grades in $r$ rounds by reducing proxcensus with $2s-1$ grades to proxcensus with $s$ grades in one round. The expand-and-extract paradigm uses proxcensus to expand binary inputs to $2^\\lambda+1$ grades in $\\lambda$ rounds before extracting a binary output by partitioning the grades using a $\\lambda$ bit common coin. However, the proxcensus protocol by Fitzi et al. does not translate to the asynchronous setting without lowering the corruption threshold or using more rounds in each recursive step.\r\n\r\nThis is resolved by attaching justifiers to all messages: forcing the adversary to choose between being ignored by the honest parties, or sending messages with certain validity properties. Using these we define validated proxcensus and show that it can be instantiated in asynchrony with the same recursive structure and round complexity as synchronous proxcensus. In asynchrony the extraction phase incurs a security loss of one bit which is recovered by expanding to twice as many grades using an extra round of communication. This results in a $\\lambda+2$ round VABA and a $\\lambda+3$ round BA, both with $2^{-\\lambda}$ error probability and communication complexity matching Fitzi et al.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation schemes are powerful primitives that enable distributed and incremental verifiable computation with less overhead than recursive SNARKs. However, existing schemes with constant-size accumulation verifiers, suffer from linear-sized accumulators and deciders, leading to linear-sized proofs that are unsuitable in distributed settings. Motivated by the need for bandwidth efficient accountable voting protocols, (I) We introduce KZH, a novel polynomial commitment scheme, and (II) KZH-fold, the first sublinear accumulation scheme where the verifier only does $3$ group scalar multiplications and $O(n^{1/2})$ accumulator size and decider time. Our scheme generalizes to achieve accumulator and decider complexity of $k \\cdot n^{1/k}$ with verifier complexity $k$. Using the BCLMS compiler, (III) we build an IVC/PCD scheme with sublinear proof and decider. (IV) Next, we propose a new approach to non-uniform IVC, where the cost of proving a step is proportional only to the size of the step instruction circuit, and unlike previous approaches, the witness size is not linear in the number of instructions. (V) Leveraging these advancements, we demonstrate the power of KZH-fold by implementing an accountable voting scheme using a novel signature aggregation protocol supporting millions of participants, significantly reducing communication overhead and verifier time compared to BLS-based aggregation. We implemented and benchmarked our protocols and KZH-fold achieves a 2000x reduction in communication and a 50x improvement in decider time over Nova when proving 2000 Poseidon hashes, at the cost of 3x the prover time.",

    "abstract": "Overclocking is a a supported functionality of Nvidia GPUs, and is a common performance enhancement practice. However, overclocking poses a danger for cryptographic applications. As the temperature in the overclocked GPU increases, spurious computation faults occur. Coupled with well known fault attacks against RSA implementations, one can expect such faults to allow compromising RSA private keys during decryption or signing. \r\n\r\nWe first validate this hypothesis: We evaluate two commercial-grade GPU-based implementations of RSA within openSSL (called RNS and MP), under a wide range of overclocking levels and temperatures, and demonstrate that both implementations are vulnerable.\r\n\r\nHowever, and more importantly, we show for the first time that even if the GPU is benignly overclocked to a seemingly ``safe'' rate, a successful attack can still be mounted, over the network, by simply sending requests at an aggressive rate to increase the temperature. Hence, setting any level of overclocking on the GPU is risky.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we observe a huge difference in the implementations'\r\nvulnerability: the rate of RSA breaks for RNS is 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of MP. We attribute this difference to the implementations' memory usage patterns: RNS makes heavy use of the GPU's global memory, which is accessed via both the Unified (L1) cache and the L2 cache; MP primarily uses ``shared'' on-chip memory, which is local to each GPU Streaming MultiProcessor (SM) and is uncached,  utilizing the memory banks used for the L1 cache. We believe that the computation faults are caused by reads from the global memory, which under a combination of overclocking, high temperature and high memory contention, occasionally return stale values.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel single-trace side-channel attack on FALCON---a lattice-based post-quantum digital signature protocol recently approved for standardization by NIST. We target the discrete Gaussian sampling operation within the FALCON key generation scheme and use a single power measurement trace to succeed. Notably, negating the 'shift right 63-bit' operation (for 64-bit values) leaks critical information about the '-1' vs. '0' assignments to intermediate coefficients. These leaks enable full recovery of the generated secret keys. The proposed attack is implemented on an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller running both reference and optimized software implementation from FALCON's NIST Round 3 package. \r\n Statistical analysis with 500k tests reveals a per coefficient success rate of 99.9999999478% and a full key recovery success rate of 99.99994654% for FALCON-512. This work highlights the vulnerability of current software solutions to single-trace attacks and underscores the urgent need to develop single-trace resilient software for embedded systems.",

    "abstract": "We develop an efficient algorithm to detect whether a superspecial genus 2 Jacobian is optimally $(N, N)$-split for each integer $N \\leq 11$. Incorporating this algorithm into the best-known attack against the superspecial isogeny problem in dimension 2 (due to Costello and Smith) gives rise to significant cryptanalytic improvements. Our implementation shows that when the underlying prime $p$ is 100 bits, the attack is sped up by a factor of $25$; when the underlying prime is 200 bits, the attack is sped up by a factor of $42$; and, when the underlying prime is 1000 bits, the attack is sped up by a factor of $160$. Furthermore, we describe a more general algorithm to find endomorphisms of superspecial genus 2 Jacobians.",

    "abstract": "OPC UA is a standardized Industrial Control System (ICS) protocol, deployed in critical infrastructures, that aims to ensure security. The forthcoming version 1.05 includes major changes in the underlying cryptographic design, including a Diffie-Hellmann based key exchange, as opposed to the previous RSA based version. Version 1.05 is supposed to offer stronger security, including Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS). \r\n\r\nWe perform a formal security analysis of the security protocols specified in OPC UA v1.05 and v1.04, for the RSA-based and the new DH-based mode, using the state-of-the-art symbolic protocol verifier ProVerif. Compared to previous studies, our model is much more comprehensive, including the new protocol version, combination of the different sub-protocols for establishing secure channels, sessions and their management, covering a large range of possible configurations. This results in one of the largest models ever studied in ProVerif raising many challenges related to its verification mainly due to the complexity of the state machine. We discuss how we mitigated this complexity to obtain meaningful analysis results. Our analysis uncovered several new vulnerabilities, that have been reported to and acknowledged by the OPC Foundation. We designed and proposed provably secure fixes, most of which are included in the upcoming version of the standard.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study practical constructions of asynchronous distributed key reconfiguration ($\\mathsf{ADKR}$), which enables an asynchronous fault-tolerant system with an existing threshold cryptosystem to efficiently generate a new threshold cryptosystem for a reconfigured set of participants. While existing asynchronous distributed threshold key generation ($\\mathsf{ADKG}$) protocols theoretically solve $\\mathsf{ADKR}$, they fail to deliver satisfactory scalability due to cubic communication overhead, even with simplifications to the reconfiguration setting.\r\n\r\nWe introduce a more efficient \\textit{share-dispersal-then-agree-and-recast} paradigm for constructing $\\mathsf{ADKR}$ with preserving adaptive security. The method replaces expensive $O(n)$ asynchronous verifiable secret sharing   protocols in   classic $\\mathsf{ADKG}$ with $O(n)$ cheaper dispersals of publicly-verifiable sharing transcripts;  after consensus confirms a set of finished dispersals, it selects a small $\\kappa$-subset of finished dispersals for verification, reducing the total overhead to $O(\\kappa n^2)$ from $O(n^3)$, where $\\kappa$ is a small constant (typically $\\sim$30 or less). To further optimize concrete efficiency, we propose an interactive protocol with linear communication to generate publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) transcripts, avoiding computationally expensive non-interactive PVSS. Additionally, we introduce a distributed PVSS verification mechanism, minimizing redundant computations across different parties and reducing the dominating PVSS verification cost by about one-third.\r\n\r\nOur design also enables diverse applications: (i) given a quadratic-communication asynchronous coin-flipping protocol, it implies the first quadratic-communication $\\mathsf{ADKG}$; and (ii) it can   be extended to realize the first quadratic-communication asynchronous dynamic proactive secret sharing (ADPSS) protocol with adaptive security. Experimental evaluations on a global network of 256 AWS servers show up to 40\\% lower latency compared to state-of-the-art $\\mathsf{ADKG}$ protocols (with simplifications to the reconfiguration setting), highlighting the practicality of our $\\mathsf{ADKR}$ in large-scale asynchronous systems.",

    "abstract": "We give a sieving algorithm for finding pairs of primes with small multiplicative orders modulo each other. This problem is a necessary condition for obtaining constructions of $2$-cycles of pairing-friendly curves, which have found use in cryptographic applications. Our database of examples suggests that, with the exception of a well-known infinite family of such primes, instances become increasingly rare as the size of the primes increase. This leads to some interesting open questions for which we hope our database prompts further investigation.",

    "abstract": "We propose a quantum function secret sharing scheme in which the communication is exclusively classical. In this primitive, a classical dealer distributes a secret quantum circuit $C$ by providing shares to  $p$ quantum parties. The parties on an input state $\\ket{\\psi}$ and a projection $\\Pi$, compute values $y_i$ that they then classically communicate back to the dealer, who can then compute $\\lVert\\Pi C\\ket{\\psi}\\rVert^2$ using only classical resources. Moreover,  the shares do not leak much information about the secret circuit $C$.\r\nOur protocol for quantum secret sharing uses the Cayley path, a tool that has been extensively used to support quantum primacy claims. More concretely, the shares of $C$ correspond to randomized version of $C$ which are delegated to the quantum parties, and the reconstruction can be done by extrapolation. Our scheme has two limitations, which we prove to be inherent to our techniques: First, our scheme is only secure against single adversaries, and we show that if two parties collude, then they can break its security. Second, the evaluation done by the parties requires exponential time in the number of gates.",

    "abstract": "We propose the first $\\textit{distributed}$ version of a simple, efficient, and provably quantum-safe pseudorandom function (PRF). The distributed PRF (DPRF) supports arbitrary threshold access structures based on the hardness of the well-studied Learning with Rounding (LWR) problem. Our construction (abbreviated as $\\mathsf{PQDPRF}$) practically outperforms not only existing constructions of DPRF based on lattice-based assumptions, but also outperforms (in terms of evaluation time) existing constructions of: (i) classically secure DPRFs based on discrete-log hard groups, and (ii) quantum-safe DPRFs based on any generic quantum-safe PRF (e.g. AES). The efficiency of $\\mathsf{PQDPRF}$ stems from the extreme simplicity of its construction, consisting of a simple inner product computation over $\\mathbb{Z}_q$, followed by a rounding to a smaller modulus $p < q$. The key technical novelty of our proposal lies in our proof technique, where we prove the correctness and post-quantum security of $\\mathsf{PQDPRF}$ (against semi-honest corruptions of any less than threshold number of parties) for a polynomial $q/p$ (equivalently, \"modulus to modulus\")-ratio. \r\n\r\nOur proposed DPRF construction immediately enables efficient yet quantum-safe instantiations of several practical applications, including key distribution centers, distributed coin tossing, long-term encryption of information, etc. We showcase a particular application of $\\mathsf{PQDPRF}$ in realizing an efficient yet quantum-safe version of distributed symmetric-key encryption ($\\mathsf{DiSE}$ -- originally proposed by Agrawal et al. in CCS 2018), which we call $\\mathsf{PQ-DiSE}$. For semi-honest adversarial corruptions across a wide variety of corruption thresholds, $\\mathsf{PQ-DiSE}$ substantially outperforms existing instantiations of $\\mathsf{DiSE}$ based on discrete-log hard groups and generic PRFs (e.g. AES). We illustrate the practical efficiency of our $\\mathsf{PQDPRF}$ via prototype implementation of $\\mathsf{PQ-DiSE}$.",

    "abstract": "Quasi-cyclic moderate-density parity check (QC-MDPC) code-based encryption schemes under iterative decoders offer highly-competitive performance in the quantum-resistant space of cryptography, but the decoding-failure rate (DFR) of these algorithms are not well-understood. The DFR decreases extremely rapidly as the ratio of code-length to error-bits increases, then decreases much more slowly in regimes known as the waterfall and error-floor, respectively.\r\n\r\nThis work establishes three, successively more detailed probabilistic models of the DFR for iterative decoders for QC-MPDC codes: the simplified model, the refined model for perfect keys, and the refined model for all keys. The models are built upon a Markov model introduced by Sendrier and Vasseur that closely predicts decoding behavior in the waterfall region but does not capture the error floor behavior. The simplified model introduces a modification which captures the dominant contributor to error floor behavior which is convergence to near codewords introduced by Vasseur in his PhD thesis. The refined models give more accurate predictions taking into account certain structural features of specific keys.\r\n\r\nOur models are based on the step-by-step decoder, which is highly simplified and experimentally displays worse decoding performance than parallel decoders used in practice.  Despite the use of the simplified decoder, we obtain an accurate prediction of the DFR in the error floor and demonstrate that the error floor behavior is dominated by convergence to a near codeword during a failed decoding instance.  Furthermore, we have run this model for a simplified version of the QC-MDPC code-based cryptosystem BIKE to better ascertain whether the DFR is low enough to achieve IND-CCA2 security.  Our model for a modified version of BIKE 1 gives a DFR which is below $2^{-129.5}$, using a block length $r = 13477$ instead of the BIKE 1 parameter $r = 12323$.",

    "abstract": "As cryptographic protocols transition to post-quantum security, most adopt hybrid solutions combining pre-quantum and post-quantum assumptions. However, this shift often introduces trade-offs in terms of efficiency, compactness, and in some cases, even security. One such example is deniability, which enables users, such as journalists or activists, to deny authorship of potentially incriminating messages. While deniability was once mainly of theoretical interest, protocols like X3DH, used in Signal and WhatsApp, provide it to billions of users. Recent work (Collins et al., PETS'25) has further bridged the gap between theory and real-world applicability. In the post-quantum setting, however, protocols like PQXDH, as well as others such as Apple\u2019s iMessage with PQ3, do not support deniability. This work investigates how to preserve deniability in the post-quantum setting by leveraging unconditional (statistical) guarantees instead of computational assumptions - distinguishing deniability from confidentiality and authenticity.\r\n\r\nAs a case study, we present a hybrid authenticated key encapsulation mechanism (AKEM) that provides statistical deniability, while maintaining authenticity and confidentiality through a combination of pre-quantum and post-quantum assumptions. To this end, we introduce two combiners at different levels of abstraction. First, at the highest level, we propose a black-box construction that combines two AKEMs, showing that deniability is preserved only when both constituent schemes are deniable. Second, we present Shadowfax, a non-black-box combiner that integrates a pre-quantum NIKE, a post-quantum KEM, and a post-quantum ring signature. We demonstrate that Shadowfax ensures deniability in both dishonest and honest receiver settings. When instantiated, we rely on statistical security for the former, and on a pre- or post-quantum assumption in the latter. Finally, we provide an optimised, yet portable, implementation of a specific instantiation of Shadowfax yielding ciphertexts of 1781 bytes and public keys of 1449 bytes. Our implementation achieves competitive performance: encapsulation takes 1.9 million cycles and decapsulation takes 800000 cycles on an Apple M1 Pro.",

    "abstract": "Supersingular elliptic curve isogeny graphs underlie isogeny-based cryptography. For isogenies of a single prime degree $\\ell$, their structure has been investigated graph-theoretically.\r\nWe generalise the notion of $\\ell$-isogeny graphs to $L$-isogeny graphs (studied in the prime field case by Delfs and Galbraith), where $L$ is a set of small primes dictating the allowed isogeny degrees in the graph. We analyse the graph-theoretic structure of $L$-isogeny graphs. Our approaches may be put into two categories: cycles and graph cuts. \r\n\r\nOn the topic of cycles, we provide: a count for the number of non-backtracking cycles in the $L$-isogeny graph using traces of Brandt matrices; an efficiently computable estimate based on this approach; and a third ideal-theoretic count for a certain subclass of $L$-isogeny cycles. We provide code to compute each of these three counts.   \r\n\r\nOn the topic of graph cuts, we compare several algorithms to compute graph cuts which minimise a measure called the edge expansion, outlining a cryptographic motivation for doing so. Our results show that a greedy neighbour algorithm out-performs standard spectral algorithms for computing optimal graph cuts. We provide code and study explicit examples. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, we describe several directions of active and future research.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to verifiable vote tallying using additive  homomorphism, which can be appended to existing voting systems without modifying the underlying infrastructure.  Existing End-to-End Verifiable (E2E-V) systems like Belenios and ElectionGuard rely on distributed trust models or are vulnerable to decryption compromises, making them less suitable for general elections. Our approach introduces a tamper-evident commitment to votes through cryptographic hashes derived from homomorphic encryption schemes such as Paillier. The proposed system provides tallied-as-cast verifiability without revealing individual votes, thereby preventing coercion. The system also provides the ability to perform public verification of results. We also show that this system can be transitioned to quantum-secure encryption like Regev for future-proofing the system.  We discuss how to deploy this system in a real-world scenario, including for general political elections, analyzing the security implications and report on the limitations of this system. We believe that the proposed system offers a practical solution to the problem of verifiable vote tallying in general elections.",

    "abstract": "Physical side-channel analysis (SCA) operates on the foundational assumption of access to known plaintext or ciphertext. However, this assumption can be easily invalidated in various scenarios, ranging from common encryption modes like Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) to complex hardware implementations, where such data may be inaccessible. Blind SCA addresses this challenge by operating without the knowledge of plaintext or ciphertext. Unfortunately, prior such approaches have shown limited success in practical settings.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce the Deep Learning-based Blind Side-channel Analysis (DL-BSCA) framework, which leverages deep neural networks to recover secret keys in blind SCA settings. In addition, we propose a novel labeling method, Multi-point Cluster-based (MC) labeling, accounting for dependencies between leakage variables by exploiting multiple sample points for each variable, improving the accuracy of trace labeling. \r\nWe validate our approach across four datasets, including symmetric key algorithms (AES and Ascon) and a post-quantum cryptography algorithm, Kyber, with platforms ranging from high-leakage 8-bit AVR XMEGA to noisy 32-bit ARM STM32F4. Notably, previous methods failed to recover the key on the same datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the first successful blind SCA on a desynchronization countermeasure enabled by DL-BSCA and MC labeling. All experiments are validated with real-world SCA measurements, highlighting the practicality and effectiveness of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Impossible differential (ID) cryptanalysis and impossible boomerang (IB) cryptanalysis are two methods of impossible cryptanalysis against block ciphers. Since the seminal work introduced by Boura et al. in 2014, there have been no substantial advancements in the key recovery process for impossible cryptanalysis, particularly for the IB attack.In this paper, we propose a generic key recovery framework for impossible cryptanalysis that supports arbitrary key-guessing strategies, enabling optimal key recovery attacks. Within the framework, we provide a formal analysis of probabilistic extensions in impossible cryptanalysis for the first time. Besides, for the construction of IB distinguishers, we propose a new method for finding contradictions in multiple rounds.\r\n\r\nBy incorporating these techniques, we propose an Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)-based tool for finding full ID and IB attacks. To demonstrate the power of our methods, we applied it to several block ciphers, including SKINNY, SKINNYee, Midori, and Deoxys-BC. Our approach yields a series of optimal results in impossible cryptanalysis, achieving significant improvements in time and memory complexities. Notably, our IB attack on SKINNYee is the first 30-round attack.",

    "abstract": "In 2011, Lu introduced the impossible boomerang attack at DCC. This powerful cryptanalysis technique combines the strengths of the impossible differential and boomerang attacks, thereby inheriting the advantages of both cryptographic techniques. In this paper, we propose a holistic framework comprising two generic and effective algorithms and a MILP-based model to search for the optimal impossible boomerang attack systematically. The first algorithm incorporates any key guessing strategy, while the second integrates the meet-in-the-middle (MITM) attack into the key recovery process. Our framework is highly flexible, accommodating any set of attack parameters and returning the optimal attack complexity. When applying our framework to Deoxys-BC-256, Deoxys-BC-384, Joltik-BC-128, Joltik-BC-192, and SKINNYe v2, we achieve several significant improvements. We achieve the first 11-round impossible boomerang attacks on Deoxys-BC-256\\ and Joltik-BC-128. For SKINNYe v2, we achieve the first 33-round impossible boomerang attack, then using the MITM approach in the key recovery attack, the time complexity is significantly reduced. Additionally, for the 14-round Deoxys-BC-384 and Joltik-BC-192, the time complexity of the impossible boomerang attack is reduced by factors exceeding 2^{27} and 2^{12}, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The nonlinear filter model is an old and well understood approach to the design of secure stream ciphers. Extensive research over several decades has shown how to attack stream ciphers based on this model and has identified the security properties required of the Boolean function used as the filtering function to resist such attacks. This led to the problem of constructing Boolean functions which provide adequate security and at the same time are efficient to implement. Unfortunately, over the last two decades no good solutions to this problem appeared in the literature. The lack of good solutions has effectively led to nonlinear filter model becoming more or less obsolete. This is a big loss to the cryptographic design toolkit, since the great advantages of the nonlinear filter model are its simplicity, well understood security and the potential to provide low cost solutions for hardware oriented stream ciphers. In this paper we construct balanced functions on an odd number $n\\geq 5$ of variables with the following provable properties: linear bias equal to $2^{-\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor -1}$, algebraic degree equal to $2^{\\lfloor \\log_2\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor \\rfloor}$, algebraic immunity at least $\\lceil (n-1)/4\\rceil$, fast algebraic immunity at least $1+\\lceil (n-1)/4\\rceil $, and can be implemented using $O(n)$ NAND gates. The functions are obtained from a simple modification of the well known class of Maiorana-McFarland bent functions. By appropriately choosing $n$ and the length $L$ of the linear feedback shift register, we show that it is possible to obtain examples of stream ciphers which are $\\kappa$-bit secure against known types of attacks for various values of $\\kappa$. We provide concrete proposals for $\\kappa=80,128,160,192,224$ and $256$. For the $80$-bit, $128$-bit, and the $256$-bit security levels, the circuits for the corresponding stream ciphers require about 1743.5, 2771.5, and 5607.5 NAND gates respectively. For the $80$-bit and the $128$-bit security levels, the gate count estimates compare quite well to the famous ciphers Trivium and Grain-128a respectively, while for the $256$-bit security level, we do not know of any other stream cipher design which has such a low gate count.",

    "abstract": "Anonymous Attribute-Based Credentials (ABCs) allow users to prove possession of attributes while adhering to various authentication policies and without revealing unnecessary information. Single-use ABCs are particularly appealing for their lightweight nature and practical efficiency. These credentials are typically built using blind signatures, with Anonymous Credentials Light (ACL) being one of the most prominent schemes in the literature. However, the security properties of single-use ABCs, especially their secure showing property, have not been fully explored, and prior definitions and corresponding security proofs fail to address scenarios involving partial attribute disclosure effectively. In this work, we propose a stronger secure showing definition that ensures robust security even under selective attribute revelation. Our definition extends the winning condition of the existing secure showing experiment by adding various constraints on the subsets of opened attributes. We show how to represent this winning condition as a matching problem in a suitable bipartite graph, thus allowing for it to be verified efficiently. We then prove that ACL satisfies our strong secure showing notion without any modification. Finally, we define double-spending prevention for single-use ABCs, and show how ACL satisfies the definition.",

We consider an adversary that is a participating party of PJC and describe four practical attacks that break the other party's input privacy, and which are able to recover both membership of keys in the intersection and their associated values.  Our attacks consider the privacy threats associated with deployment and highlight the need to include the functionality output as part of the MPC security model.",

    "abstract": "The GINX method in TFHE offers low-latency ciphertext bootstrapping with relatively small bootstrapping keys, but is limited to binary or ternary key distributions. In contrast, the AP method supports arbitrary key distributions, however at the cost of significantly large bootstrapping keys. Building on AP, automorphism-based methods (LMK\u207a, EUROCRYPT 2023) achieve smaller keys, though each automorphism application necessitates a key switch, introducing computational overhead and noise.\r\nThis paper advances automorphism-based methods in two important ways. First, it proposes a novel traversal blind rotation algorithm that optimizes the number of key switches for a given key material. Second, it introduces an automorphism-parametrized external product that seamlessly applies an automorphism to one of the input ciphertexts. Together, these techniques substantially reduce the number of key switches, resulting in faster bootstrapping and improved noise control.  As an independent contribution, this paper also introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing the expected number of automorphism key switches, whose predictions perfectly align with the results of extensive numerical experiments, demonstrating its practical relevance.\r\nIn a typical setting, by utilizing additional key material, the LLW\u207a approach (TCHES 2024) reduces key switches by 17% compared to LMK\u207a. Our combined techniques achieve a 46% reduction using similar key material and can eliminate an arbitrary large number (e.g., > 99%) of key switches  with only a moderate (9x) increase in key material size.",

Over the last several decades, we have seen tremendous advances in new designs and constructions for $\\mathsf{FE}$ supporting different function classes, from a variety of assumptions and with varying levels of security. Unfortunately, the same has not been replicated in the multi-authority setting. The current scope of $\\mathsf{MA}$-$\\mathsf{FE}$ designs is rather limited, with positive results only known for (all-or-nothing) attribute-based functionalities, or need full power of general-purpose code obfuscation. This state-of-the-art in $\\mathsf{MA}$-$\\mathsf{FE}$ could be explained in part by the implication provided by Brakerski et al. (ITCS'17). It was shown that a general-purpose obfuscation scheme can be designed from any $\\mathsf{MA}$-$\\mathsf{FE}$ scheme for circuits, even if the $\\mathsf{MA}$-$\\mathsf{FE}$ scheme is secure only in a bounded-collusion model, where at most two keys per authority get corrupted.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we revisit the problem of $\\mathsf{MA}$-$\\mathsf{FE}$, and show that existing implication from $\\mathsf{MA}$-$\\mathsf{FE}$ to obfuscation is not tight. We provide new methods to design $\\mathsf{MA}$-$\\mathsf{FE}$ for circuits from simple and minimal cryptographic assumptions. Our main contributions are summarized below\r\n\r\n  1. We design a $\\mathsf{poly}(\\lambda)$-authority $\\mathsf{MA}$-$\\mathsf{FE}$ for circuits in the bounded-collusion model. Under the existence of public-key encryption, we prove it to be statically simulation-secure. Further, if we assume sub-exponential security of public-key encryption, then we prove it to be adaptively simulation-secure in the Random Oracle Model.\r\n  2. We design a $O(1)$-authority $\\mathsf{MA}$-$\\mathsf{FE}$ for circuits in the bounded-collusion model. Under the existence of 2/3-party non-interactive key exchange, we prove it to be adaptively simulation-secure.\r\n  3. We provide a new generic bootstrapping compiler for $\\mathsf{MA}$-$\\mathsf{FE}$ for general circuits to design a simulation-secure $(n_1 + n_2)$-authority $\\mathsf{MA}$-$\\mathsf{FE}$ from any two $n_1$-authority and $n_2$-authority $\\mathsf{MA}$-$\\mathsf{FE}$.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we revisit shuffle protocol for Shamir secret sharing. Upon examining previous works, we observe that existing constructions either produce non-uniform shuffle or require large communication and round complexity, e.g. exponential in the number of parties. We propose two shuffle protocols, both of which shuffle uniformly within $O(\\frac{k + l}{\\log k}n^2m\\log m)$ communication for shuffling rows of an $m\\times l$ matrix shared among $n$ parties, where $k\\leq m$ is a parameter balancing communication and computation. Our first construction is more concretely efficient, while our second construction requires only $O(nml)$ online communication within $O(n)$ round. In terms of overall communication and online communication, both shuffle protocols outperform current optimal shuffle protocols for Shamir secret sharing.\r\n        \r\nAt the core of our constructions is a novel permutation-sharing technique, which can be used to permute arbitrarily many vectors by computing matrix-vector products. Once shared, applying a permutation becomes much cheaper, which results in a faster online phase. Letting each party share one secret uniform permutation in the offline phase and applying them sequentially in the online phase, we obtain our first shuffle protocol. To further optimize online complexity and simplify the trade-off, we adopt the shuffle correlation proposed by Gao et al. and obtain the second shuffle protocol with $O(nml)$ online communication and $O(n^2ml)$ online computation. This brings an additional benefit that the online complexity is now independent of offline complexity, which reduces parameter optimization to optimizing offline efficiency.\r\n\r\nOur constructions require only most basic primitives in Shamir secret sharing scheme, and work for arbitrary field $\\mathbb{F}$ of size larger than $n$. As shuffle is a frequent operation in algorithm design, we expect them to accelerate many other primitives in context of Shamir secret sharing MPC, such as sorting, oblivious data structure, etc.",

    "abstract": "The computation of the inverse of a polynomial over a quotient ring or a finite field plays a very important role during the key generation of post-quantum cryptosystems like NTRU, BIKE, and LEDACrypt. It is therefore important that there exist an efficient algorithm capable of running in constant time, to prevent timing side-channel attacks. In this article, we study both constant-time algorithms based on Fermat's Little Theorem and the Extended $GCD$ Algorithm, and provide a detailed comparison in terms of performance. According to our conclusion, we see that the constant-time Extended $GCD$-based Bernstein-Yang's algorithm shows a better performance with 1.76x-3.76x on \\texttt{x86} platforms compared to FLT-based methods. Although we report numbers from a software implementation, we additionally provide a short glimpse of some recent results when these two algorithms are implemented on various hardware platforms. Finally, we also explore other exponentiation algorithms that work similarly to the Itoh-Tsuji inversion method. These algorithms perform fewer polynomial multiplications and show a better performance with 1.56x-1.96x on \\texttt{x86} platform compared to Itoh-Tsuji inversion method.",

    "abstract": "Recent server-side optimizations like speculative decoding significantly enhance the interactivity and resource efficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) services. However, we show that these optimizations inadvertently introduce new side-channel vulnerabilities through network packet timing and size variations that tend to be input-dependent. Network adversaries can leverage these side channels to learn sensitive information contained in \\emph{encrypted} user prompts to and responses from public LLM services.  \r\n\r\nThis paper formalizes the security implications using a novel indistinguishability framework and introduces a novel attack that establishes the insecurity of real-world LLM services with streaming APIs under our security framework.\r\n\r\nOur proposed attack effectively deconstructs encrypted network packet traces to reveal the sizes of underlying LLM-generated tokens and whether the tokens were generated with or without certain server-side optimizations. Our attack can accurately predict private attributes in real-world privacy-sensitive LLM applications in medicine and finance with $71$--$92\\%$ accuracy on an open-source vLLM service and $50$--$90\\%$ accuracy on the commercial ChatGPT service. Finally, we show that solutions that hide these side channels to different degrees expose a tradeoff between security and performance --- specifically, interactivity and network bandwidth overheads.",

    "abstract": "A secret sharing scheme is a cryptographic primitive that allows a dealer to share a secret among a set of parties, so that only authorized subsets of them can recover it. The access structure of the scheme is the family of authorized subsets. In a weighted threshold secret sharing scheme, each party is assigned a weight according to its importance, and the authorized subsets are those in which the sum of their weights is at least the threshold value. \r\n\r\nFor these access structures, the best general constructions were presented by Beimel and Weinreb [IPL 2006]: The scheme with perfect security has share size $n^{O(\\log n)}$, while the scheme with computational security has share size polynomial in $n$. However, these constructions require the use of shallow monotone sorting networks, which limits their practical use.\r\n\r\nIn this context, we revisit this work and provide variants of these constructions that are feasible in practice. This is done by considering alternative circuits and formulas for weighted threshold functions that do not require monotone sorting networks. We show that, under the assumption that subexponentially secure one-way functions exist, any WTAS over $n$ parties and threshold $\\sigma$ admits a computational secret sharing scheme where the size of the shares is $\\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ and the size of the public information is $O(n^2\\log n\\log \\sigma)$. Moreover, we show that any authorized subset only needs to download $O(n\\log n\\log \\sigma)$ bits of public information to recover the secret.",

    "abstract": "Correlated randomness lies at the core of efficient modern secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocols. Costs of generating such correlated randomness required for the MPC online phase protocol often constitute a bottleneck in the overall protocol. \r\nA recent paradigm of {\\em pseudorandom correlation generator} (PCG) initiated by Boyle et al. (CCS'18, Crypto'19) offers an appealing solution to this issue. In sketch, each party is given a short PCG seed, which can be locally expanded into long correlated strings, satisfying the target correlation. Among various types of correlations, there is oblivious linear evaluation (OLE), a fundamental and useful primitive for typical MPC protocols on arithmetic circuits. \r\nTowards efficient generating a great amount of OLE, and applications to MPC protocols, we establish the following results:\r\n\r\n(i) We propose a novel {\\em programmable} PCG construction for OLE over any field $\\mathbb{F}_p$.  For $kN$ OLE correlations, we require $O(k\\log{N})$ communication and $O(k^2N\\log{N})$ computation, where $k$ is an arbitrary integer $\\geq 2$. Previous works either have quadratic computation (Boyle et al. Crypto'19), or can only support fields of size larger than $2$ (Bombar et al. Crypto'23).\r\n\r\n(ii) We extend the above OLE construction to provide various types of correlations for any finite field. One of the fascinating applications is an efficient PCG for two-party {\\em authenticated Boolean multiplication triples}. For $kN$ authenticated triples, we offer PCGs with seed size of $O(k^2\\log{N})$ bits. To our best knowledge, such correlation has not been realized with sublinear communication and quasi-linear computation ever before. \r\n\r\n(iii) In addition, the \\emph{programmability} admits efficient PCGs for multi-party Boolean triples, and thus the first efficient MPC protocol for Boolean circuits with {\\em silent} preprocessing. In particular, we show $kN$ $m$-party Boolean multiplication triples can be generated in $O(m^2k\\log{N})$-bit communication, while the state-of-the-art FOLEAGE (Asiacrypt'24) requires a broadcast channel and takes $mkN+O(m^2\\log{kN})$ bits communication.\r\n\r\n(iv) Finally, we present efficient PCGs for circuit-dependent preprocessing, matrix multiplications triples, and string OTs etc. Compared to previous works, each has its own right.",

    "abstract": "The Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is a crucial component in many post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms, enabling efficient polynomial multiplication. However, the reliability of NTT computations is an important concern, especially for safety-critical applications. This work presents novel techniques to improve the fault tolerance of NTTs used in prominent PQC schemes such as Kyber, Dilithium, and Falcon. The work first establishes a theoretical framework for error detection in NTTs, exploiting the inherent algebraic properties of these transforms. It derives necessary and sufficient conditions for constructing error-detecting vectors that can identify single faults without the need for costly recomputation. For the Dilithium scheme, the work further advances the state-of-the-art by developing the first algorithm capable of detecting up to two maliciously placed faults. The proposed error detection methods are shown to reduce the number of required multiplications by half, leading to significant improvements in computational efficiency compared to existing single error-detecting algorithms. Concrete implementations for Kyber, Dilithium, and Falcon demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the error-detection scheme.",

    "abstract": "In white-box cryptography, early encoding-based countermeasures have been broken by the DCA attack, leading to the utilization of masking schemes against a surge of automated attacks. The recent filtering attack from CHES 2024 broke the last viable masking scheme from CHES 2021 resisting both computational and algebraic attacks, raising the need for new countermeasures.\r\n\r\n    In this work, we perform the first formal study of the combinations of existing countermeasures and demonstrate that applying Dummy Shuffling (EUROCRYPT 2021) then ISW masking (CRYPTO 2003) to a circuit carries algebraic, correlation, and filtering security - necessary conditions to withstand state-of-the-art automated attacks. We also show that applying these two countermeasures in the opposite order leads to a Higher-Order Filtering attack, highlighting the importance of the order of application of the combined countermeasures.\r\n\r\n    We also propose a new masking scheme called S5, standing for the Semi-Shuffled Secret Sharing Scheme, a scheme merging Dummy Shuffling and ISW in a single countermeasure more efficiently than a direct composition.",

    "abstract": "Zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs) are a powerful tool for proving computation correctness, attracting significant interest from researchers, developers, and users. However, the complexity of zk-SNARKs has created gaps between these groups, hindering progress. Researchers focus on constructing efficient proving systems with stronger security and new properties, while developers and users prioritize toolchains, usability, and compatibility.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we provide a comprehensive study of zk-SNARK, from theory to practice, pinpointing gaps and limitations. We first present a master recipe that unifies the main steps in converting a program into a zk-SNARK. We then classify existing zk-SNARKs according to their key techniques. Our classification addresses the main difference in practically valuable properties between existing zk-SNARK schemes. We survey over 40 zk-SNARKs since 2013 and provide a reference table listing their categories and properties. Following the steps in master recipe, we then survey 11 general-purpose popular used libraries. We elaborate on these libraries' usability, compatibility, efficiency and limitations. Since installing and executing these zk-SNARK systems is challenging, we also provide a completely virtual environment in which to run the compiler for each of them. We identify that the proving system is the primary focus in cryptography academia. In contrast, the constraint system presents a bottleneck in industry. To bridge this gap, we offer recommendations and advocate for the opensource community to enhance documentation, standardization and compatibility.",

    "abstract": "Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is currently being discussed as a technology to safeguard communication in a future where quantum computers compromise traditional public-key cryptosystems. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive security evaluation of QKD-based solutions, focusing on real-world use cases sourced from academic literature and industry reports. We analyze these use cases, assess their security and identify the possible advantages of deploying QKD-based solutions. We further compare QKD-based solutions with Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), the alternative approach to achieving security when quantum computers compromise traditional public-key cryptosystems, evaluating their respective suitability for each scenario. Based on this comparative analysis, we critically discuss and comment on which use cases QKD is suited for, considering factors such as implementation complexity, scalability, and long-term security. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the role QKD could play in future cryptographic infrastructures and offer guidance to decision-makers considering the deployment of QKD.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain service offerings have seen a rapid rise\r\nin recent times. Many of these services realize a decentralized\r\narchitecture with a threshold adversary to avoid a single\r\npoint of failure and to mitigate key escrow issues. While\r\npayments to such services are straightforward in systems\r\nsupporting smart contracts, achieving fairness poses challenges\r\nin systems like Bitcoin, adhering to the UTXO model with\r\nlimited scripting capabilities. This is especially challenging\r\nwithout smart contracts, as we wish to pay only the required\r\nthreshold of t + 1 out of the n servers offering the service\r\ntogether, without any server claiming the payment twice.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce VITARIT 1, a novel payment\r\nsolution tailored for threshold cryptographic services in UTXO\r\nsystems like Bitcoin. Our approach guarantees robust provable\r\nsecurity while facilitating practical deployment. We focus on\r\nthe t-out-of-n distributed threshold verifiable random function\r\n(VRF) service with certain properties, such as threshold BLS\r\nsignatures, a recently highlighted area of interest. Our protocol\r\nenables clients to request verifiable random function (VRF)\r\nvalues from the threshold service, triggering payments to up\r\nto t + 1 servers of the distributed threshold VRF.\r\n\r\nOur efficient design relies on simple transactions using\r\nsignature verification scripts, making it immediately applicable\r\nin Bitcoin-like systems. We also introduce new tools and\r\ntechniques at both the cryptographic and transaction layers,\r\nincluding a novel signature-VRF exchange protocol for standard\r\nconstructions, which may be of independent interest. Addition-\r\nally, our transaction flow design prevents malicious servers\r\nfrom claiming payments twice, offering broader implications for\r\ndecentralized payment systems. Our prototype implementation\r\nshows that in the two-party interaction, the client takes 126.4\r\nmsec, and the server takes 204 msec, demonstrating practicality\r\nand deployability of the system",

    "abstract": "We revisit Updatable Public-Key Encryption (UPKE), which was introduced as a practical mechanism for building forward-secure cryptographic protocols. We begin by observing that all UPKE notions to date are neither syntactically flexible nor secure enough for the most important multi-party protocols motivating UPKE. We provide an intuitive taxonomy of UPKE properties -- some partially or completely overlooked in the past -- along with an overview of known (explicit and implicit) UPKE constructions. We then introduce a formal UPKE definition capturing all intuitive properties needed for multi-party protocols.\r\n\r\nNext, we provide a practical pairing-based construction for which we provide concrete security bounds under a standard assumption in the random oracle and the algebraic group model. The efficiency profile of the scheme compares very favorably with existing UPKE constructions (despite the added flexibility and stronger security). For example, when used to improve the forward security of the Messaging Layer Security protocol [RFC9420], our new UPKE construction requires $\\approx 1\\%$ of the bandwidth of the next-most efficient UPKE construction satisfying the strongest UPKE notion previously considered.",

    "abstract": "Cross-chain bridges, realizing the transfer of information and assets between blockchains, form the core of blockchain interoperability solutions. Most existing bridge networks are modeled in an honest-malicious setting, where the bridge nodes are either honest or malicious. Rationality allows the nodes to deviate from the protocol arbitrarily for an economic incentive. In this work, we present HyperLoop, an efficient cross-chain multi-signature bridge and prove that it is safe and live game-theoretically, under the more realistic rational-malicious model.\r\n\r\nAs rational bridge nodes are allowed to deviate from the protocol and even collude, a monitor mechanism is necessitated, which we realize by introducing whistle-blower nodes. These whistle-blowers constantly check the operations of the bridge and raise complaints to a complaint resolution network in case of discrepancies. To enforce punishments, it is necessary for the nodes to stake an amount before participating as bridge nodes. Consequently, a cap on the volume of funds transferred over the bridge is established. We describe a sliding window mechanism and establish a relation between the stake and the sliding window limit necessary for the safety of the bridge.\r\n\r\nOur design yields an economic, computation, and communication-efficient bridge. We realize and deploy our bridge prototype bridging Ethereum and Polygon chains over testnets. For a 19-node bridge network, each bridge node takes an average of only 3 msec to detect and sign a source chain request, showing the highly efficiency and low-latency of the bridge.",

    "abstract": "Lund et al. (JACM 1992) invented the powerful Sumcheck protocol that has been extensively used in complexity theory and also for designing concretely efficient (zero-knowledge) arguments. In this work, we systematically study Sumcheck in the context of secure multi-party computation (MPC). Our main result is a new generic framework for lifting semi-honest MPC protocols to malicious security, with a {\\em constant} multiplicative overhead in {\\em both} computation and communication, and even additional logarithmic communication in the best case. In general, our approach applies to any semi-honest linear secret-sharing based MPC secure up to additive attacks, where secret-sharings can be added with an authentication property. At a high-level, our approach has a highly distributive flavor, where the parties jointly emulate a Sumcheck prover that proves the correctness of MPC semi-honest evaluations in zero-knowledge, meanwhile they also jointly emulate a Sumcheck verifier and verify the proof themselves. Along the way, we provide a new angle of view on the {\\em fully linear interactive oracle proof} (FLIOP) systems proposed by Boneh et al. (CRYPTO 2019). That is, essentially distributed sumcheck on proving a batch of multiplications is an optimized concrete instantiation of the FLIOP-based approach.\r\n\r\nAs concrete applications of our techniques, we first consider semi-honest MPC protocols based on Shamir secret-sharing with an honest majority. Suppose $M$-party and circuit size $N$, to achieve malicious security, our approach only introduces additional $10MN+O(M\\log{N})$ total computation,  communication of reconstructions of $4\\log{N}+6$ secret-shared values, $O(\\log{N})$ rounds and $O(\\log{N})$ correlated randomness. This shows that malicious security with abort in honest majority MPC comes {\\em free} in terms of both computation and communication.\r\n\r\nWe then consider dishonest majority MPC, where the best known semi-honest protocol achieves $2N$ online communication per party and sublinear preprocessing by using programmable pseudorandom correlation generators (PCGs). We realize malicious MPC with $4N+O(\\log{N})$ online communication as well as sublinear preprocessing, matching the optimal $2\\times$ communication overhead in Hazay et al. (JOC 2024). Our protocol is essentially obtained by using Sumcheck techniques to check authenticated multiplication triple relations, which requires only $N+1$ {\\em standard Beaver triples} and $O(\\log{N})$ random authenticated shares for $N$ semi-honestly generated authenticated triples. Compared to the FLIOP-based checking mechanism (Boyle et al. CRYPTO 2022) that requires $O(\\sqrt{N})$ communication and $O(N^{1.5})$ computation, we do not introduce any cryptographic assumption beyond PCGs, and have $O(N)$ computation.",

    "abstract": "SIMON is a lightweight block cipher proposed by the National Security Agency. \r\nAccording to previous cryptanalytic results on SIMON, differential and linear cryptanalysis are the two most effective attacks on it. \r\nUsually, there are many trails sharing the same input and output differences (resp. masks). \r\nThese trails comprise the differential (resp. linear hull) and can be used together when mounting attacks. \r\nIn ASIACRYPT 2021, Leurent et al. proposed a matrix-based method on SIMON-like ciphers, where only trails whose active bits stay in a $w$-bit window are considered. \r\nThe static window in each round is chosen to be $w$ least significant bits. \r\nThey applied this efficient framework on SIMON and SIMECK, and have obtained many better differentials and linear hulls than before. For SIMON, they also found that there seems to be some potential for improvement, which should be further investigated.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we dynamically choose window for each round to achieve better distinguishers. Benefiting from these dynamic windows, we can obtain stronger differentials and linear hulls than previously proposed for almost all versions of SIMON. \r\nFinally, we provided the best differential/linear attacks on SIMON48, SIMON64, and SIMON96 in terms of round number, complexity, or success rate.",

This ensures that, up to a threshold number, probes placed in different rounds remain independent. Based on this observation, we propose composition theorems for deterministic masking\r\nschemes. On the practical side, we extend the proof of first- and second-order probing security for Ascon\u2019s protected permutation from a single round to an arbitrary number of rounds",

    "abstract": "Payment channels have emerged as a promising solution to address the performance limitations of cryptocurrencies payments, enabling efficient off-chain transactions while maintaining security guarantees. However, existing payment channel protocols, including the widely-deployed Lightning Network and the state-of-the-art Sleepy Channels, suffer from a fundamental vulnerability: non-atomic state transitions create race conditions that can lead to unexpected financial losses. We first formalize current protocols into a common paradigm and prove that this vulnerability is fundamental\u2014any protocol following this paradigm cannot guarantee balance security due to the inherent race conditions in their design. To address this limitation, we propose a novel atomic paradigm for payment channels that ensures atomic state transitions, effectively eliminating race conditions while maintaining all desired functionalities. Based on this paradigm, we introduce Ultraviolet, a secure and efficient payment channel protocol that achieves both atomicity and high performance, while avoiding the introduction of unimplemented Bitcoin features. Ultraviolet reduces the number of required messages per transaction by half compared to existing solutions, while maintaining comparable throughput. We formally prove the security of Ultraviolet under the universal composability framework and demonstrate its practical efficiency through extensive evaluations across multiple regions. This results in a 37% and 52% reduction in latency compared to the Lightning Network and Sleepy Channels, respectively. Regarding throughput, Ultraviolet achieves performance comparable to the Lightning Network and delivers 2\u00d7 the TPS of Sleepy Channels.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we build upon the blinding methods introduced in recent years to enhance the protection of lattice-based cryptographic schemes against side-channel and fault injection attacks. Specifically, we propose a cost-efficient blinded Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) that impedes the convergence of Soft Analytical Side-Channel Attacks (SASCA), even with limited randomness sampling. Additionally, we extend the blinding mechanism based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) and  Redundant Number Representation (RNR) introduced by Heiz and P\u00f6ppelmann by reducing the randomness sampling overhead and accelerating the verification phase.\r\n\r\nThese two blinding mechanisms are nicely compatible with each other's and, when combined, provide enhanced resistance against side-channel attacks, both classical and soft analytical, as well as fault injection attacks, while maintaining high performance and low overhead, making the approach well-suited for practical applications, particularly in resource-constrained IoT environments.",

    "abstract": "We introduce an enhanced requirement of deniable public key encryption that we call dual-deniability. It asks that a sender who is coerced should be able to produce fake randomness, which can explain the target ciphertext as the encryption of any alternative message under any valid key she/he desires to deny. Compared with the original notion of deniability (Canetti et al. in CRYPTO \u201997, hereafter named message-deniability), this term further provides a shield for the anonymity of the receiver against coercion attacks.\r\n      We first give a formal definition of dual-deniability, along with its weak-mode variant. For conceptual understanding, we then show dual-deniability implies semantic security and anonymity against CPA, separates full robustness, and even contradicts key-less or mixed robustness, while is (constructively) implied by key-deniability and full robustness with a minor assumption for bits encryption. As for the availability of dual-deniability, our main scheme is a generic approach from ciphertext-simulatable PKE, where we devise a subtle multi-encryption schema to hide the true message within random masking ciphertexts under plan-ahead setting. Further, we leverage the weak model to present a more efficient scheme having negligible detection probability and constant ciphertext size. Besides, we revisit the notable scheme (Sahai and Waters in STOC \u201914) and show it is inherently dual-deniable. Finally, we extend the Boneh-Katz transform to capture CCA security, deriving dual-deniable and CCA-secure PKE from any selectively dual-deniable IBE under multi-TA setting. Overall our work mounts the feasibility of anonymous messaging against coercion attacks.",

Obliviousness ensures nothing is revealed about the data besides input/output sizes, even against a strong adversary that can observe memory access patterns.\r\nOur solution achieves this by combining trusted hardware with efficient oblivious primitives for compaction and sorting, and two oblivious algorithms: (i) an oblivious aggregation tree, which can be described as a variation of the parallel prefix sum, customized for trusted hardware, and (ii) a novel algorithm for obliviously expanding the elements of a relation.\r\nIn the sequential setting, our oblivious join performs $4.6\\times$- $5.14\\times$ faster than the prior state-of-the-art solution (Krastnikov et al., VLDB 2020) on data sets of size $n=2^{24}$. In the parallel setting, our algorithm achieves a speedup of up to roughly $16\\times$ over the sequential version, when running with 32 threads (becoming up to $80\\times$ compared to the sequential algorithm of Krastnikov et al.).\r\nFinally, our oblivious operators can be used independently to support other oblivious relational database queries, such as oblivious selection and oblivious group-by.",

    "abstract": "Differential cryptanalysis is one of the main methods of cryptanalysis and has been applied to a wide range of ciphers. While it is very successful, it also relies on certain assumptions that do not necessarily hold in practice. One of these is the hypothesis of stochastic equivalence, which states that the probability of a differential characteristic behaves similarly for all keys. Several works have demonstrated examples where this hypothesis is violated, impacting the attack complexity and sometimes even invalidating the investigated prior attacks. Nevertheless, the hypothesis is still typically taken for granted. In this work, we propose AutoDiVer, an automatic tool that allows to thoroughly verify differential characteristics. First, the tool supports calculating the expected probability of differential characteristics while considering the key schedule of the cipher. Second, the tool supports estimating the size of the space of keys for which the characteristic permits valid pairs, and deducing conditions for these keys. AutoDiVer implements a custom SAT modeling approach and takes advantage of a combination of features of advanced SAT solvers, including approximate model counting and clause learning. To show applicability to many different kinds of block ciphers like strongly aligned, weakly aligned, and ARX ciphers, we apply AutoDiVer to GIFT, PRESENT, RECTANGLE, SKINNY, WARP, SPECK, and SPEEDY.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate several computational problems motivated by post-quantum cryptosystems based on isogenies and ideal class group actions on oriented elliptic curves. Our main technical contribution is an efficient algorithm for embedding the ring of integers of an imaginary quadratic field \\( K \\) into some maximal order of the quaternion algebra \\( B_{p,\\infty} \\) ramified at a prime \\( p \\) and infinity. Assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), our algorithm runs in probabilistic polynomial time, improving upon previous results that relied on heuristics or required the factorization of \\( \\textnormal{disc}(K) \\). Notably, this algorithm may be of independent interest.\r\n    Our approach enhances the work of Love and Boneh on computing isogenies between \\( M \\)-small elliptic curves by eliminating heuristics and improving computational efficiency. Furthermore, given a quadratic order \\( \\mathfrak{O} \\) in \\( K \\), we show that our algorithm reduces the computational endomorphism ring problem of \\( \\mathfrak{O} \\)-oriented elliptic curves to the Vectorization problem in probabilistic polynomial time, assuming the conductor of \\( \\mathfrak{O} \\) can be efficiently factorized. Previously, the best known result required the full factorization of \\( \\textnormal{disc}(\\mathfrak{O}) \\), which may be exponentially large.\r\n    Additionally, when the conductor of \\( \\mathfrak{O} \\) can be efficiently factorized, we establish a polynomial-time equivalence between the Quaternion Order Embedding Problem, which asks to embed a quadratic order \\( \\mathfrak{O} \\) into a maximal order in \\( B_{p,\\infty} \\), and computing horizontal isogenies between \\( \\mathfrak{O} \\)-oriented elliptic curves. Leveraging this reduction, we propose a rigorous algorithm, under GRH, that solves the quaternion order embedding problem in time \\( \\tilde{O}(|\\mathrm{disc}(\\mathfrak{O})|^{1/2}) \\), improving upon previous methods that required higher asymptotic time and relied on several heuristics.",

    "abstract": "RingCT signatures are essential components of Ring Confidential Transaction (RingCT) schemes on blockchain platforms, enabling anonymous transaction spending and significantly impacting the scalability of these schemes. This paper makes two primary contributions:\r\n\r\nWe provide the first thorough analysis of a recently developed Any-out-of-N proof in the discrete logarithm (DLOG) setting and the associated RingCT scheme, introduced by ZGSX23 (S&P '23). The proof conceals the number of the secrets to offer greater anonymity than K-out-of-N proofs and uses an efficient \"K-Weight\" technique for its construction. However, we identify for the first time several limitations of using Any-out-of-N proofs, such as increased transaction sizes, heightened cryptographic complexities and potential security risks. These limitations prevent them from effectively mitigating the longstanding scalability bottleneck.\r\n\r\nWe then continue to explore the potential of using K-out-of-N proofs to enhance scalability of RingCT schemes. Our primary innovation is a new DLOG-based RingCT signature that integrates a refined \"K-Weight\"-based K-out-of-N proof and an entirely new tag proof. The latter is the first to efficiently enable the linkability of RingCT signatures derived from the former, effectively resisting double-spending attacks.\r\n\r\nFinally, we identify and patch a linkability flaw in ZGSX23's signature. We benchmark our scheme against this patched one to show that our scheme achieves a boost in scalability, marking a promising step forward.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of finding a path between conjugate supersingular elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ for a prime $p$, which is important for cycle finding in supersingular isogeny graphs. We see that for any given $p$, there is some $l$ corresponding to $p$ which accelerates the process of conjugate path-finding. Also, time-wise, the most efficient way of overviewing the graph is seeing $i(=3)$ steps at once. We have outlined methods in which the next vertex of any pseudo-random walk should be chosen to reach conjugate vertex faster. We have experimentally investigated the paths between frobenius conjugates for wide ranges of small prime $l$. We introduce sets to experimentally learn about the structure of the isogeny graphs when short cycles are present.",

    "abstract": "We study error detection and correction in a computationally bounded world, where errors are introduced by an arbitrary $\\textit{polynomial-time}$ adversarial channel. Our focus is on $\\textit{seeded}$ codes, where the encoding and decoding procedures can share a public random seed, but are otherwise deterministic. We can ask for either $\\textit{selective}$ or $\\textit{adaptive}$ security, depending on whether the adversary can choose the message being encoded before or after seeing the seed. For large alphabets, a recent construction achieves essentially optimal rate versus error tolerance trade-offs under minimal assumptions, surpassing information-theoretic limits. However, for the binary alphabet, the only prior improvement over information theoretic codes relies on non-standard assumptions justified via the random oracle model. We show the following:\r\n\r\n$\\textbf{Selective Security under LWE:}$ Under the learning with errors (LWE) assumption, we construct selectively secure codes over the binary alphabet. For error detection, our codes achieve essentially optimal rate $R \\approx 1$ and relative error tolerance $\\rho \\approx \\frac{1}{2}$. For error correction, they can uniquely correct $\\rho < 1/4$ relative errors with a rate $R$ that essentially matches that of the best list-decodable codes with error tolerance $\\rho$. Both cases provide significant improvements over information-theoretic counterparts. The construction relies on a novel form of 2-input correlation intractable hash functions that we construct from LWE.\r\n\r\n$\\textbf{Adaptive Security via Crypto Dark Matter:}$  Assuming the exponential security of a natural collision-resistant hash function candidate based on the ``crypto dark matter'' approach  of mixing linear functions over different moduli, we construct adaptively secure codes over the binary alphabet, for both error detection and correction. They achieve essentially the same trade-offs between error tolerance $\\rho$ and rate $R$ as above, with the caveat that for error-correction they only do so for sufficiently small values of $\\rho$.",

    "abstract": "It is often desirable to break cryptographic primitives into two components: an input-independent offline component, and a cheap online component used when inputs arrive. Security of such online/offline primitives must be proved in the input-adaptive setting: the adversary chooses its input adaptively, based on what it sees in the offline-phase. Proving security in the input-adaptive setting can be difficult, particularly when one wishes to achieve simulation security and avoid idealized objects like a random oracle (RO).\r\n\r\nThis work proposes a framework for reasoning about input-adaptive primitives: adaptive distributional security (ADS). Roughly, an ADS primitive provides security when it is used with inputs drawn from one of two distributions that are themselves hard to distinguish. ADS is useful as a framework for the following reasons:\r\n    - An ADS definition can often circumvent impossibility results imposed on the corresponding simulation-based definition. This allows us to decrease the online-cost of primitives, albeit by using a weaker notion of security.\r\n    - With care, one can typically upgrade an ADS-secure object into a simulation-secure object (by increasing cost in the online-phase).\r\n    - ADS is robust, in the sense that (1) it enables a form of composition and (2) interesting ADS primitives are highly interconnected in terms of which objects imply which other objects.\r\n    - Many useful ADS-secure objects are plausibly secure from straightforward symmetric-key cryptography.\r\n\r\nWe start by defining the notion of an ADS encryption (ADE) scheme.\r\nA notion of input-adaptive encryption can be easily achieved from RO, and the ADE definition can be understood as capturing the concrete property provided by RO that is sufficient to achieve input-adaptivity. From there, we use ADE to achieve ADS variants of garbled circuits and oblivious transfer, to achieve simulation-secure garbled circuits, oblivious transfer, and two-party computation, and prove interconnectedness of these primitives. In sum, this results in a family of objects with extremely cheap online-cost.",

    "abstract": "The decentralized nature of blockchains is touted to provide censorship resistance. However, in reality, the ability of proposers to completely control the contents of a block makes censorship relatively fragile. To combat this, a notion of inclusion lists has been proposed in the blockchain community. This paper presents the first formal study of inclusion lists. Our inclusion list design leverages multiple proposers to propose transactions and improve censorship resistance. The design has two key components. The first component is a utility-maximizing input list creation mechanism that allows rational proposers to achieve a correlated equilibrium while prioritizing high-value transactions. The second component, AUCIL (auction-based inclusion list), is a mechanism for aggregating the input lists from the proposers to output an inclusion list.",

However, to our knowledge, there is no attack in the literature that takes advantage of an attacker knowing rejected signatures. The aim of this paper is to create a practical black-box attack against Dilithium with a weakened rejection sampling. We succeed in showing that an adversary with enough rejected signatures can recover Dilithium's secret key in less than half an hour on a desktop computer. There is one possible application for this result: by physically preventing one of the rejection sampling tests from happening, we obtain two fault attacks against Dilithium.",

    "abstract": "The present article is a natural extension of the previous one about the GLV method of accelerating a (multi-)scalar multiplication on elliptic curves of moderate CM discriminants $D < 0$. In comparison with the first article, much greater magnitudes of $D$ (in absolute value) are achieved, although the base finite fields of the curves have to be pretty large. This becomes feasible by resorting to quite powerful algorithmic tools developed primarily in the context of lattice-based and isogeny-based cryptography. Curiously, pre-quantum cryptography borrows research outcomes obtained when seeking conversely quantum-resistant solutions or attacks on them. \r\n\r\nFor instance, some $2$-cycle of pairing-friendly MNT curves (with $-D \\approx 100{,}000{,}000$, i.e., $\\log_2(-D) \\approx 26.5$) is relevant for the result of the current article. The given $2$-cycle was generated at one time by Guillevic to provide $\\approx 128$ security bits, hence it was close to application in real-world zk-SNARKs. Another more performant MNT $2$-cycle (with slightly smaller security level, but with much larger $D$) was really employed in the protocol Coda (now Mina) until zero-knowledge proof systems on significantly faster pairing-free (or half-pairing) $2$-cycles were invented. It is also shown in the given work that more lollipop curves, recently proposed by Costello and Korpal to replace MNT ones, are now covered by the GLV technique.",

    "abstract": "This work proposes an encrypted hybrid database framework that combines vectorized data search and relational data query over quantized fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). We observe that, due to the lack of efficient encrypted data ordering capabilities, most existing encrypted database (EDB) frameworks do not support hybrid queries involving both vectorized and relational data. To further enrich query expressiveness while retaining evaluation efficiency, we propose Engorgio, a hybrid EDB framework based on quantized data ordering techniques over FHE.  Specifically, we design a new quantized data encoding scheme along with a set of novel comparison and permutation algorithms to accurately generate and apply orders between large-precision data items. Furthermore, we optimize specific query types, including full table scan, batched query, and Top-k query to enhance the practical performance of the proposed framework. In the experiment, we show that, compared to the state-of-the-art EDB frameworks, Engorgio is up to 28x--854x faster in homomorphic comparison, 65x--687x faster in homomorphic sorting and 15x--1,640x faster over a variety of end-to-end relational, vectorized, and hybrid SQL benchmarks. Using Engorgio, the amortized runtime for executing a relational and hybrid query on a 48-core processor is under 3 and 75 seconds, respectively, over a 10K-row hybrid database.",

    "abstract": "We propose a sublinear-sized proof system for rank-one constraint satisfaction over polynomial rings (Ring-R1CS), particularly for rings of the form $Z_{Q}[X]/(X^N+1)$. These rings are widely used in lattice-based constructions, \r\nwhich underlie many modern post-quantum cryptographic schemes. \r\nConstructing efficient proof systems for arithmetic over these rings is challenged by two key obstacles: (1) Under practical popular choices of $Q$ and $N$, the ring $Z_{Q}[X]/(X^N+1)$ is not field-like, and thus tools like Schwartz\u2013Zippel lemma cannot apply; (2) when $N$ is large, which is common in implementations of lattice-based cryptosystems, the ring is large, causing the proof size suboptimal.\r\nIn this paper, we address these two obstacles, enabling more efficient proofs for arithmetics over $Z_{Q}[X]/(X^N+1)$ when $Q$ is a `lattice-friendly' modulus, \r\nincluding moduli that support fast NTT computation or power-of-two moduli. \r\nOur primary tool is a novel \\emph{ring switching} technique. \r\nThe core idea of ring switching is to convert the R1CS over $Z_{Q}[X]/(X^N+1)$ into another R1CS instance over Galois rings, which is field-like and small (with size independent with $N$).\r\nAs (zero-knowledge) proofs have many applications in cryptography, we expect that efficient proof systems for polynomial ring arithmetic could lead to more efficient constructions of advanced primitives from lattice assumptions, such as aggregate signatures, group signatures, verifiable random function, or verifiable fully holomorphic encryption.",

    "abstract": "Multiplication and other non-linear operations are widely recognized as the most costly components of secure two-party computation (2PC) based on linear secret sharing. Multiplication and non-linear operations are well known to be the most expensive protocols in secure two-party computation (2PC). Moreover, the comparison protocol (or $\\mathsf{Wrap}$ protocol) is essential for various operations such as truncation, signed extension, and signed non-uniform multiplication. This paper aims to optimize these protocols by avoiding invoking the costly comparison protocol, thereby improving their efficiency.\r\n\r\nWe propose a novel approach to study 2PC from a geometric perspective. Specifically, we interpret the two shares of a secret as the horizontal and vertical coordinates of a point in a Cartesian coordinate system, with the secret itself represented as the corresponding point. This reformulation allows us to address the comparison problem by determining the region where the point lies. Furthermore, we identify scenarios where the costly comparison protocol can be replaced by more efficient evaluating AND gate protocols within a constrained range. Using this method, we improve protocols for truncation, signed extension and signed non-uniform multiplication, all of which are fundamental to 2PC. In particular, for the one-bit error truncation protocol and signed extension protocols, we reduce the state-of-the-art communication complexities of Cheetah (USENIX\u201922) and SirNN (S\\&P\u201921) from $\\approx \\lambda (l + 1)$ to $\\approx \\lambda$ in two rounds, where $l$ is the input length and $\\lambda$ is the security parameter. For signed multiplication with non-uniform bit-width, we reduce the communication cost of SirNN's by 40\\% to 60\\%.",

    "abstract": "Quantum money is the cryptographic application of the quantum no-cloning theorem. It has recently been instantiated by Montgomery and Sharif (Asiacrypt'24) from class group actions on elliptic curves. In this work, we propose a novel method to forge a quantum banknote by leveraging the efficiency of evaluating division polynomials with the coordinates of rational points, offering a more efficient alternative to brute-force attack. Since our attack still requires exponential time, it remains impractical to forge a quantum banknote. Interestingly, due to the inherent properties of quantum money, our attack method also results in a more efficient verification procedure. As our algorithm employs the rational points and the quadratic twists to verify the cardinality of the superposition of elliptic curves, we expect it to inspire future research on elliptic-curve-based quantum cryptography.",

    "abstract": "Distributed certification is a set of mechanisms that allows an all-knowing prover to convince the units of a communication network that the network's state has some desired property, such as being $3$-colorable or triangle-free. Classical mechanisms, such as proof labeling schemes (PLS), consist of a message from the prover to each unit, followed by on-e round of communication between each unit and its neighbors. \r\nLater works consider extensions, called distributed interactive proofs, where the prover and the units can have multiple rounds of communication before the communication among the units. Recently, Bick, Kol, and Oshman (SODA '22) defined a zero-knowledge version of distributed interactive proofs, where the prover convinces the units of the network\u2019s state without revealing any other information about the network\u2019s state or structure.  In their work, they propose different variants of this model and show that many graph properties of interest can be certified with them.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we define and study distributed non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (dNIZK); these can be seen as a non-interactive version of the aforementioned model, and also as a zero-knowledge version of PLS.  We prove the following: \r\n\r\n- There exists a dNIZK protocol for $3$-coloring with  $O(\\log n)$-bit messages from the prover and $O(\\log n)$-size messages among neighbors. This disproves a conjecture from previous work asserting that the total number of bits from the prover should grow linearly with the number of edges.  \r\n\r\n- There exists a family of dNIZK protocols for triangle-freeness, that presents a trade-off between the size of the messages from the prover and the size of the messages among neighbors. Interestingly, we also introduce a variant of this protocol where the message size depends only on the maximum degree of a node and not on the total number of nodes, improving upon the previous non-zero-knowledge protocol for this problem.  \r\n\r\n-  There exists a dNIZK protocol for any graph property in NP in the random oracle models, which is secure against an arbitrary number of malicious parties. Previous work considered compilers from PLS to distributed zero-knowledge protocol, which results in protocols with parameters that are incomparable to ours.",

    "abstract": "Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is a privacy-enhancing technology that enables computation over encrypted data without the need for decryption. A primary application of HE is in the construction of communication-efficient Two-Party Computation (2PC) protocols between a client and a server, serving as the key owner and the evaluator, respectively. In this context, it is reasonable to assume that the evaluation circuit involves some confidential information of the server; otherwise, the client could compute it on their own. However, the 2PC protocol built on an HE scheme is not necessarily secure, as the standard IND-CPA security of HE does not guarantee the privacy of the evaluation circuit. Several enhanced security notions for HE, such as circuit privacy and sanitization, have been proposed to address this issue, but they require significant overhead in terms of parameter size or complexity.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we introduce a novel security notion for HE, called ciphertext simulatability, which precisely captures the security requirements of HE in the construction of 2PC. Then, we provide a concrete construction of ciphertext-simulatable HE from the BFV scheme by modifying its evaluation algorithm. We provide theoretical analysis and demonstrate experimental results to ensure that our solution has insignificant overhead in terms of parameter size and error growth. As a matter of independent interest, we demonstrate how our approach of designing ciphertext-simulatable BFV can be further extended to satisfy stronger security notions such as sanitization.",

    "abstract": "Deniable Authentication is a highly desirable guarantee for secure messaging: it allows Alice to authentically send a message $m$ to a designated receiver Bob in a *Plausibly Deniable* manner. Concretely, while Bob is guaranteed Alice sent $m$, he cannot convince a judge Judy that Alice really sent this message---even if he gives Judy his secret keys. This is because Judy knows Bob *can* make things up. This paper models the security of Multi-Designated Verifier Signatures (MDVS) and Multi-Designated Receiver Signed Public Key Encryption (MDRS-PKE)---two (related) types of schemes that provide such guarantees---in the Constructive Cryptography (CC) framework (Maurer and Renner, ICS '11).\r\n\r\nThe only work modeling dishonest parties' ability of \"making things up\" was by Maurer et al. (ASIACRYPT '21), who modeled the security of MDVS, also in CC. Their security model has two fundamental limitations:\r\n  1. deniability is not guaranteed when honest receivers read;\r\n  2. it relies on the CC-specific concept of specifications.  \r\n\r\nWe solve both problems. Regarding the latter, our model is a standard simulator-based one. Furthermore, our composable treatment allowed to identify a new property, Forgery Invalidity, without which we do not know how to prove the deniability of neither MDVS nor MDRS-PKE when honest receivers read. Finally, we prove that Chakraborty et al.'s MDVS (EUROCRYPT '23) has this property, and that Maurer et al.'s MDRS-PKE (EUROCRYPT '22) preserves it from the underlying MDVS.",

    "abstract": "Payment channels are auspicious candidates in layer-2 solutions to reduce the number of on-chain transactions on traditional blockchains and increase transaction throughput. To construct payment channels, peers lock funds on 2-of-2 multisig addresses and open channels between one another to transact via instant peer-to-peer transactions. Transactions between peers without a direct channel are made possible by routing the payment over a series of adjacent channels. In certain cases, this can lead to relatively low transaction success rates and high transaction fees. In this work, we introduce pliability to constructing payment channels and graft edges with more than two endpoints into the payment graph. We refer to these constructions as hyperedges. We present hyperedge-based topologies to form hypergraphs and compare them to Bitcoin's Lightning network and other state-of-the-art solutions. The results demonstrate that hyperedge-based implementations can both increase transaction success rate, in addition to decreasing the network cost by more than 50% compared to that of the Lightning Network.",

    "abstract": "We present new techniques for garbling mixed arithmetic and boolean circuits, utilizing the homomorphic secret sharing scheme introduced by Roy \\& Singh (Crypto 2021), along with the half-tree protocol developed by Guo et al (Eurocrypt 2023). Compared to some two-party interactive protocols, our mixed garbling only requires several times $(<10)$ more communication cost.\r\n\r\nWe construct the bit decomposition/composition gadgets with communication cost $O((\\lambda+\\lambda_{\\text{DCR}}/k)b)$ for integers in the range $(-2^{b-1}, 2^{b-1})$, requiring $O(2^k)$ computations for the GGM-tree. Our approach is compatible with constant-rate multiplication protocols, and the cost decreases as $k$ increases. Even for a small $k=8$, the concrete efficiency ranges from $6\\lambda b$ ($b \\geq 1000$ bits) to $9\\lambda b$ ($b \\sim 100$ bits) per decomposition/composition. In addition, we develop the efficient gadgets for mod $q$ and unsigned truncation based on bit decomposition and composition.\r\n\r\nWe construct efficient arithmetic gadgets over various domains. For bound integers, we improve the multiplication rate in the work of Meyer et al. (TCC 2024) from $\\textstyle\\frac{\\zeta-2}{\\zeta+1}$ to $\\frac{\\zeta-2}{\\zeta}$. We propose new garbling schemes over other domains through bounded integers with our modular and truncation gadgets, which is more efficient than previous constructions. For $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^b}$, additions and multiplication can be garbled with a communication cost comparable to our bit decomposition. For general finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, particularly for large values of $p$ and $n$, we garble the addition and multiplication at the cost of $O((\\lambda+\\lambda_{\\text{DCR}}/k)b)$, where $b = n\\lceil \\log p \\rceil$. For applications to real numbers, we introduce an ``error-based'' truncation that makes the cost of multiplication dependent solely on the desired precision.",

    "abstract": "NovaTEE is a novel private multilateral settlement network designed to address critical inefficiencies in both traditional financial markets and cryptocurrency trading. The current clearing landscape suffers from fragmented capital allocation, restrictive prime brokerage relationships, and prolonged settlement timeframes in traditional finance, while cryptocurrency markets face challenges with over-collateralization, siloed lending pools, and security risks from centralized exchanges.\r\n\r\nWe introduce a settlement system that leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and threshold cryptography to enable secure, private, and efficient settlement of obligations between multiple parties. The system utilizes a distributed key generation model and novel clearing mechanisms to optimize capital efficiency through multilateral netting, while maintaining strong privacy guarantees and regulatory compliance capabilities. By combining TEE-based security with advanced cryptographic protocols, including zero-knowledge proofs and sparse Merkle trees for data verification, our solution enables efficient cross-venue and cross-chain settlement while protecting sensitive trading information. This approach significantly reduces capital requirements for market participants, optimizes transaction costs, and provides institutional-grade clearing infrastructure without compromising on security or privacy. The system's architecture ensures that no single party has complete access to transaction details while maintaining auditability through a distributed backup network, offering a practical solution for institutional adoption of on-chain settlement.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces practical schemes for keyword Private Information Retrieval (keyword PIR), enabling private queries on public databases using keywords. Unlike standard index-based PIR, keyword PIR presents greater challenges, since the query's position within the database is unknown and the domain of keywords is vast. Our key insight is to construct an efficient and compact key-to-index mapping, thereby reducing the keyword PIR problem to standard PIR. To achieve this, we propose three constructions incorporating several new techniques. The high-level approach involves (1) encoding the server's key-value database into an indexable database with a key-to-index mapping and (2) invoking standard PIR on the encoded database to retrieve specific positions based on the mapping. We conduct comprehensive experiments, with results showing substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art keyword PIR, ChalametPIR (CCS'24), i.e., a $15\\sim178 \\times$ reduction in communication and $1.1 \\sim 2.4 \\times$ runtime improvement, depending on database size and entry length. Our constructions are practical, executing keyword PIR in just 47 ms for a database containing 1 million 32-byte entries.",

    "abstract": "Differential privacy (DP) is a fundamental technique used in machine learning (ML) training for protecting the privacy of sensitive individual user data. In the past few years, a new approach for combining prior-based Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanisms with a relaxed DP criterion, known as Label DP, has shown great promise in increasing the utility of the final trained model without compromising on the DP privacy budget. In this work, we identify a crucial privacy gap in the current implementations of these prior-based LDP mechanisms, namely the leakage of sensitive priors. We address the challenge of implementing such LDP mechanisms without leaking any information about the priors while preserving the efficiency and accuracy of the current insecure implementations. To that end, we design simple and efficient secure two-party computation (2PC) protocols for addressing this challenge, implement them, and perform end-to-end testing on standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10. Our empirical results indicate that the added security benefit essentially comes almost for free in the sense that the gap between the current insecure implementations and our proposed secure version, in terms of run-time overhead and accuracy degradation, is minimal. E.g., for CIFAR-10, with strong DP privacy parameter, the additional runtime due to 2PC is $\\approx 3.9\\%$ over WAN with $0.4\\%$ decrease in accuracy over an insecure (non-2PC) approach.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of quantum computers, optimizing the quantum implementations of symmetric-key ciphers, which constitute the primary components of the quantum oracles used in quantum attacks based on Grover and Simon's algorithms, has become an active topic in the cryptography community. In this field, a challenge is to construct quantum circuits that require the least amount of quantum resources. In this work, we aim to address the problem of constructing quantum circuits with the minimal T-depth or width (number of qubits) for nonlinear components, thereby enabling implementations of symmetric-key ciphers with the minimal T-depth or width. Specifically, we propose several general methods for obtaining quantum implementation of generic vectorial Boolean functions and multiplicative inversions in GF(2^n), achieving the minimal T-depth and low costs across other metrics. As an application, we present a highly compact T-depth-3 Clifford+T circuit for the AES S-box. Compared to the T-depth-3 circuits presented in previous works (ASIACRYPT 2022, IEEE TC 2024), our circuit has significant reductions in T-count, full depth and Clifford gate count. Compared to the state-of-the-art T-depth-4 circuits, our circuit not only achieves the minimal T-depth but also exhibits reduced full depth and closely comparable width. This leads to lower costs for the DW-cost and T-DW-cost. Additionally, we propose two methods for constructing minimal-width implementations of vectorial Boolean functions. As applications, for the first time, we present a 9-qubit Clifford+T circuit for the AES S-box, a 16-qubit Clifford+T circuit for a pair of AES S-boxes, and a 5-qubit Clifford+T circuit for the chi function of SHA3. These circuits can be used to derive quantum circuits that implement AES or SHA3 without ancilla qubits.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces \"Little OaldresPuzzle_Cryptic,\" a novel lightweight symmetric encryption algorithm.\r\n\r\nAt the core of this algorithm are two main cryptographic components: the NeoAlzette permutation S-box based on ARX (Addition-Rotation-XOR) primitives and the innovative pseudo-random number generator XorConstantRotation (XCR), used exclusively in the key expansion process. The NeoAlzette S-box, a non-linear function for 32-bit pairs, is meticulously designed for both encryption strength and operational efficiency, ensuring robust security in resource-constrained environments. During the encryption and decryption processes, a pseudo-randomly selected mixed linear diffusion function, distinct from XCR, is applied, enhancing the complexity and unpredictability of the encryption.\r\n\r\nWe comprehensively explore the various technical aspects of the Little OaldresPuzzle_Cryptic algorithm.\r\n\r\nIts design aims to balance speed and security in the encryption process, particularly for high-speed data transmission scenarios. Recognizing that resource efficiency and execution speed are crucial for lightweight encryption algorithms, without compromising security, we conducted a series of statistical tests to validate the cryptographic security of our algorithm. These tests included assessments of resistance to linear and differential cryptanalysis, among other measures.\r\n\r\nBy combining the NeoAlzette S-box with sophisticated key expansion using XCR, and integrating the pseudo-randomly selected mixed linear diffusion function in its encryption and decryption processes, our algorithm significantly enhances its capability to withstand advanced cryptographic analysis techniques while maintaining lightweight and efficient operation. Our test results demonstrate that the Little OaldresPuzzle_Cryptic algorithm effectively supports the encryption and decryption needs of high-speed data, ensuring robust security and making it an ideal choice for various modern cryptographic application scenarios.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Symmetric Encryption Algorithm, Lightweight Cryptography, ARX Primitives, PRNG, NeoAlzette S-boxes, XorConstantRotation, Diffusion and Confusion Layers, Cryptographic Security, Statistical Tests, Resource-Constrained Environments.",

    "abstract": "Rejection sampling is a crucial security mechanism in lattice-based signature schemes that follow the Fiat-Shamir with aborts paradigm, such as ML-DSA/CRYSTALS-Dilithium. This technique transforms secret-dependent signature samples into ones that are statistically close to a secret-independent distribution (in the random oracle model). While many side-channel attacks have directly targeted sensitive data such as nonces, secret keys, and decomposed commitments, fewer studies have explored the potential leakage associated with rejection sampling. Notably, Karabulut~et~al. showed that leakage from rejected challenges can undermine, but not entirely break, the security of the Dilithium scheme.\r\n\r\nMotivated by the above, we convert the problem of key recovery (from the leakage of rejection sampling) to an integer linear programming problem (ILP), where rejected responses of unique Hamming weights set upper/lower constraints of the product between the challenge and the private key. We formally study the worst-case complexity of the problem as well as empirically confirm the practicality of the rejected challenge attack. For all three security levels of Dilithium-2/3/5, our attack recovers the private key in seconds or minutes with a 100% Success Rate (SR).\r\n\r\nOur attack leverages knowledge of the rejected challenge and response, and thus we propose methods to extract this information by exploiting side-channel leakage from  Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) operations. We demonstrate the practicality of this rejected challenge attack by using real side-channel leakage on a Dilithium-2 implementation running on an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first efficient side-channel key recovery attack on ML-DSA/Dilithium that targets the rejection sampling procedure. Furthermore, we discuss some countermeasures to mitigate this security issue.",

    "abstract": "Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables the computation of arbitrary circuits over encrypted data. A widespread application of FHE is a simple two-party computation (2PC) protocol, where the server evaluates a circuit over the client's encrypted data and its private inputs. However, while the security of FHE guarantees that the client's data is protected from the server, there is no inherent support for the privacy of the server's input and the circuit.\r\n\r\nOne effective solution to this problem is an additional algorithm for FHE called sanitization, introduced by Ducas and Stehl\u00e9 (Eurocrypt 2016). Roughly speaking, a sanitization algorithm removes any meaningful information contained in the ciphertext, including previous evaluations of circuits. Following their definition, several constructions for sanitization have been proposed, particularly for TFHE. However, all of these methods were impractical, requiring several bootstrappings or an excessive amount of randomized evaluations.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we construct a novel sanitization algorithm for TFHE that overcomes these issues. Our method only adds two lightweight randomization steps to the original TFHE bootstrapping, without any modifications to the core algorithms. As a result, our algorithm achieves sanitization with a single bootstrapping and minimal randomization, bringing sanitization closer to practicality.\r\n\r\nTo empirically evaluate the efficiency of our method, we provide concrete benchmark results based on our proof-of-concept implementation. Our algorithm sanitizes a single TFHE ciphertext in 35.88 ms, which is only 3.4% (1.18 ms) slower than the original TFHE bootstrapping with the same parameters. When directly compared to previous works, our method achieves a speedup by a factor of 4.82 to 209.03.",

    "abstract": "We present the first protocol for efficient Fuzzy Private Set Intersection (PSI) that achieves linear communication complexity, does not depend on restrictive assumptions on the distribution of party inputs, and abstains from inefficient fully homomorphic encryption. Specifically, our protocol enables two parties to compute all pairs of elements from their respective sets that are within a given Hamming distance, without constraints on how these sets are structured.\r\n\r\nOur key insight is that securely computing the (threshold) Hamming distance between two inputs can be reduced to securely computing their inner product. Leveraging this reduction, we construct a Fuzzy PSI protocol using recent techniques for inner-product predicate encryption. To enable the use of predicate encryption in our setting, we establish that these predicate encryption schemes satisfy a weak notion of simulation security and demonstrate how their internal key derivation can be efficiently distributed without a trusted third party.\r\n\r\nAs a result, our Fuzzy PSI on top of predicate encryption features not only asymptotically optimal linear communication complexity but is also concretely practical.",

    "abstract": "The Log Structured Merge (LSM) Tree is a popular choice for key-value stores that focus on optimized write throughput while maintaining performant, production-ready read latencies. To optimize read performance, LSM stores rely on a probabilistic data structure called the Bloom Filter (BF). In this paper, we focus on adversarial workloads that lead to a sharp degradation in read performance by impacting the accuracy of BFs used within the LSM store. Our evaluation shows up to $800\\%$ increase in the read latency of lookups for popular LSM stores. We define adversarial models and security definitions for LSM stores. We implement adversary resilience into two popular LSM stores, LevelDB and RocksDB. We use our implementations to demonstrate how performance degradation under adversarial workloads can be mitigated.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we demonstrate that Ethereum's current proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism poses a significant threat to decentralisation. Our research focuses on the manipulability of distributed randomness beacons (DRBs) in leader selection. Specifically, we show that RANDAO - Ethereum's DRB - is seriously vulnerable to manipulations in its current form.  For example, if a lucrative slot is foreseen, there is a risk that staking entities may temporarily collude to control $33\\%$ of the validators, enabling them to execute a series of RANDAO manipulation attacks that secure the target slot with a $99.5\\%$ success rate. The effectiveness of our method stems from the fact that we work with a significantly richer model of the possible attacks compared to previous works. Our manipulative strategies work by missing blocks from the canonical chain - either by withholding blocks in the adversary's own slots or by forking out blocks proposed by others. We argue that while PoS can pave the path in the future for blockchains, Ethereum's current DRB implementation has to be replaced with a more secure mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Quantum cryptography allows to achieve security goals which are unobtainable using classical cryptography alone: it offers the promise of everlasting privacy. Thatis, an adversary trying to attack a protocol must succeed during the run of the protocol.\r\nAfter the protocol has terminated, security holds unconditionally.\r\nIn this work, we initiate the study of a new model which we call the quantum decoherence model (QDM). In a nutshell, this model captures adversaries that are computationally bounded during the run of a protocol (and some time after), but become computationally unbounded long after the protocol terminates. Importantly, once the adversary becomes computationally unbounded, he can only remember a bounded number of qubits from before the computational bound was lifted.\r\nWe provide a variant of the Universal Composability framework which captures the new notion of quantum decoherence and augment it with quantum random oracles. As our main contribution, we construct a non-interactive commitment scheme achieving unconditional and statistical security against malicious senders and everlasting security against malicious receivers under our new security notion. Such commitments imply general secure multiparty computation with everlasting security.\r\nFinally, we show that our core technique can be applied to a broader spectrum of problems. We show that it gives rise to everlasting public key encryption and OT in the QDM. Finally, we also consider the weaker notion of incompressible encryption in the setting of quantum decoherence, and show that post-quantum IND-CPA secure public\r\nkey encryption is sufficient to realize this notion without resorting to random oracles.\r\nAt the technical core of our constructions is a new, conceptually simple yet powerful reverse entropic uncertainty relation.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a general, low-cost, low-power statistical test for\r\ntransactions in transaction protocols with small anonymity set authentication (TPSASAs), such as Monero. The test classifies transactions as ad hoc (spontaneously constructed to spend a deterministically selected key) or self-churned (constructed from a probability distribution very close to that of the default wallet software, and with the same sender and receiver). The test is a uniformly most powerful (UMP) likelihood ratio tests (LRT) from the Neyman-Pearson Lemma, and makes no assumptions about user behavior. We extend these tests to expoit prior information about user behavior. We discuss test parameterization, as well as how anonymity set cardinality and user behavior impact test performance. We also describe a maximum-likelihood de-anonymization attack on Monero based on our test.",

    "abstract": "The ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD scheme is widely used as an alternative for AES-GCM on platforms without AES hardware instructions. Although recent analysis by Degabriele et al. shows that ChaCha20-Poly1305 provides adequate security in the conventional multiuser model, the construction is totally broken when a single nonce is repeated \u2013 a real-word scenario that can occur due to faulty implementations or the desire to use random nonces.\r\n\r\nWe present a new nonce-misuse resistant and key-committing authenticated encryption scheme, called ChaCha20-Poly1305-PSIV, that is based on carefully combining the ChaCha20-Poly1305 building blocks into the NSIV paradigm proposed by Peyrin and Seurin (CRYPTO 2016) without performance loss. We analyze the security of the underlying mode PSIV in the multi-user faulty-nonce model assuming that the underlying permutation is ideal, and prove its key-committing security in the cmt-1 model. Rust and C implementations are provided, and benchmarks confirm that performance is comparable to the ChaCha20-Poly1305 implementation in libsodium.\r\n\r\nIn terms of security and efficiency (without hardware support), our proposal compares favorably to AES-GCM-SIV. Since we reuse the ChaCha20-Poly1305 building blocks, we expect ChaCha20-Poly1305-PSIV to benefit from existing analysis and to be easy to deploy in practice.",

    "abstract": "It is well-known that any single-server PIR scheme with sublinear communication necessitates public-key cryptography. Several recent studies, which we collectively refer to as lightweight PIR, demonstrate that this limitation can be circumvented to some extent. However, all such schemes require at least $O(n^{1/2})$ communication per-query, where $n$ is the size of the database. Indeed, the celebrated result provided by Ishai et al. (Crypto '24) implies that, with solely symmetric-key cryptography,  achieving per-query communication below  $O(n^{1/2})$  necessitates more than $O(n^{1/2})$ client storage. Whether this barrier can be overcome with limited use of public-key cryptography remains an open question. In this paper, we tackle this question by presenting the first lightweight single-server PIR scheme with $O_\\lambda(n^{1/3})$ communication while allowing arbitrary (non-zero) client storage.",

    "abstract": "Time-lock puzzles are cryptographic primitives that guarantee to the generator that the puzzle cannot be solved in less than $\\mathcal{T}$ sequential computation steps. They have recently found numerous applications, e.g., in fair contract signing and seal-bid auctions. However, solvers have no a priori guarantee about the solution they will reveal, e.g., about its ``usefulness'' within a certain application scenario. In this work, we propose verifiable time-lock puzzles (VTLPs) that address this by having the generator publish a succinct proof that the solution satisfies certain properties (without revealing anything else about it). Hence solvers are now motivated to ``commit'' resources into solving the puzzle. We propose VTLPs that support proving arbitrary NP relations $\\mathcal{R}$ about the puzzle solution. \r\nAt a technical level, to overcome the performance hurdles of the ``naive'' approach of simply solving the puzzle within a SNARK that also checks $\\mathcal{R}$, our scheme combines the ``classic'' RSA time-lock puzzle of Rivest, Shamir, and Wagner, with novel building blocks for ``offloading'' expensive modular group exponentiations and multiplications from the SNARK circuit. We then propose a second VTLP specifically for checking RSA-based signatures and verifiable random functions (VRFs). Our second scheme does not rely on a SNARK and can have several applications, e.g., in the context of distributed randomness generation. Along the road, we propose new constant-size proofs for modular exponent relations over hidden-order groups that may be of independent interest. Finally, we experimentally evaluate the performance of our schemes and report the findings and comparisons with prior approaches.",

    "abstract": "Isogeny-based cryptography relies its security on the hardness of the supersingular isogeny problem: finding an isogeny between two supersingular curves defined over a quadratic field.\r\n\r\nThe Delfs-Galbraith algorithm is the most efficient procedure for solving the supersingular isogeny problem with a time complexity of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(p^{1/2})$ operations. The bottleneck of the Delfs-Galbraith algorithm is the so-called subfield curve search (i.e., finding an isogenous supersingular elliptic curve defined over the base field), which determines the time complexity.\r\n\r\nGiven that, for efficiency, most recent isogeny-based constructions propose using finite fields with field characteristics equal to $p = 2^a \\cdot f - 1$ for some positive integers $a$ and $f$.\r\nThis work focuses on primes of that particular form, and it presents two new algorithms for finding subfield curves with a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(p^{1/2})$ operations and a memory complexity polynomial in $\\log_2{p}$. Such algorithms exploit the existence of large torsion-$2^a$ points and extend the subfield root detection algorithm of Santos, Costello, and Shi (Crypto 2022) to our case study. In addition, it is worth highlighting that these algorithms easily extend to primes of the form $p =2^a \\cdot f + 1$ and $p = \\ell^a \\cdot f - 1$ with $\\ell$ being a small integer. \r\n\r\nThis study also examines the usage of radical $3$-isogenies with the proposed extended subfield root detection algorithm. In this context, the results indicate that the radical $3$-isogeny approach is competitive compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The Linear Code Equivalence ($\\mathsf{LCE}$) problem asks, for two given linear codes $\\mathcal{C}, \\mathcal{C}'$, to find a monomial $\\mathbf{Q}$ mapping $\\mathcal{C}$ into $\\mathcal{C}'$. Algorithms solving $\\mathsf{LCE}$ crucially rely on a (heuristic) subroutine, which recovers the secret monomial from $\\Omega(\\log n)$ pairs of codewords $(\\mathbf{v}_i, \\mathbf{w}_i)\\in \\mathcal{C} \\times \\mathcal{C}'$ satisfying $\\mathbf{w}_i = \\mathbf{v}_i\\mathbf{Q}$. We greatly improve on this known bound by giving a constructive (heuristic) algorithm that recovers the secret monomial from any \\emph{two} pairs of such codewords for any $q\\geq 23$. We then show that this reduction in the number of required pairs enables the design of a more efficient algorithm for solving the $\\mathsf{LCE}$ problem. Our asymptotic analysis shows that this algorithm outperforms previous approaches for a wide range of parameters, including all parameters proposed across the literature. Furthermore, our concrete analysis reveals significant bit security reductions for suggested parameters. Most notably, in the context of the LESS signature scheme, a second-round contender in the ongoing NIST standardization effort for post-quantum secure digital signatures, we obtain bit security reductions of up to 24 bits.",

    "abstract": "Network agnostic protocols (Blum, Katz, Loss TCC `19) are consensus or MPC protocols that strike a balance between purely synchronous and asynchronous protocols. Given thresholds $t_a,t_s$ that satisfy $t_a<n/3<t_s<n/2$ and $2t_s+t_a<n$, they have the unique property of remaining secure against an adversary that either (1) corrupts up to $t_s$ parties in a synchronous execution where all messages are delivered within a known bound $\\Delta$ or (2) corrupts up to $t_a$ in an asynchronous execution where messages can be delayed arbitrarily. All existing network agnostic protocols follow a design pattern which first attempts to run a synchronous path, and then switches to an asynchronous path as a fallback option if the synchronous path times out after some time $T$ due to the network being asynchronous. Unfortunately, $T$ has to be set conservatively to account for the possibility that the synchronous path might take an unusually long time even when the network is synchronous. As a result, for various basic tasks including Byzantine Agreement or MPC, no existing network agnostic protocol is able to terminate for all honest parties within constant expected time in all possible executions.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we introduce a new paradigm to construct network agnostic consensus (and MPC) that, for the first time overcome this barrier. Using this new design pattern we first present simple protocols for reliable broadcast (RB) and binary agreement (BA)\r\nthat are responsive when no more than $t_a$ parties are corrupted and run in expected constant time regardless of the network conditions. We then extend our results to asynchronous common subset (ACS) and MPC. Notably, our approach reverses the order of the synchronous and asynchronous path by designing protocols that are first and foremost asynchronous and only fall back to the synchronous execution path when more than $t_a$ parties are corrupted.",

    "abstract": "The Messaging Layer Security protocol MLS is standardized in IETF\u2019s RFC 9420 and allows a group of parties to securely establish and evolve group keys even if the servers are malicious. Its core mechanism is based on the TreeKEM protocol, but has gained many additional features and modifications during the development of the MLS standard. Over the last years, several partial security analyses have appeared of incomplete drafts of the protocol. One of the major additions to the TreeKEM design in MLS RFC 9420 (the final version of the standard) are the external operations, i.e., external commits and proposals, which interact deeply with the core TreeKEM protocol. These operations have not been considered in any previous security analysis, leaving their impact on the protocol\u2019s overall security unclear.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we formalize ETK: External-Operations TreeKEM that includes external commits and proposals. We develop a corresponding ideal functionality $F_\\mathit{ECGKA}$ and prove that ETK indeed realizes $F_\\mathit{ECGKA}$.\r\n\r\nOur work is the first cryptographic analysis that considers both the final changes to the standard\u2019s version of TreeKEM as well as external proposals and external commits. Compared to previous works that considered MLS draft versions, our ETK protocol is by far the closest to the final MLS RFC 9420 standard. Our analysis implies that the core of MLS\u2019s TreeKEM variant as defined in RFC 9420 is an ETK protocol that realizes $F_\\mathit{ECGKA}$, when used with an SUF-CMA secure signature scheme, such as the IETF variant of Ed25519. We show that contrary to previous claims, MLS does not realize $F_\\mathit{ECGKA}$ [Crypto2022] when used with signature schemes that only guarantee EUF-CMA, such as ECDSA.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we show that the security of the protocol could be further strengthened by adding a functionality to insert PSKs, allowing another form of healing, and give a corresponding construction ETK-PSK and ideal functionality $F_{\\mathit{ECGKA}^\\mathit{PSK}}$ .",

    "abstract": "A privately constrained pseudorandom function (pCPRF) is a PRF with the additional property that one can derive a constrained key that allows evaluating the PRF only on inputs satisfying a constraint predicate $C$, without revealing $C$ itself or leaking information about the PRF\u2019s output on inputs that do not satisfy the constraint.\r\n\r\nExisting privately constrained PRFs face significant limitations: either (1) they rely on assumptions known to imply fully-homomorphic encryption or indistinguishability obfuscation, (2) they support only highly restricted classes of constraints\u2014for instance, no known group-based pCPRF even supports the simple class of puncturing constraints (where the constrained key permits evaluation on all but one point while hiding the punctured point), or (3) they are limited to polynomial-size input domains. A long-standing open question has been whether one can construct a privately constrained PRF from group-based assumptions for more expressive classes of constraints. In this work, we present a pCPRF based on the decisional composite residuosity (DCR) assumption that supports a highly expressive class of predicates, namely constraints with polynomially bounded Waring rank, which notably includes puncturing.\r\n\r\nFrom a technical perspective, our work follows the general template of Couteau, Meyer, Passel\u00e8gue, and Riahinia (Eurocrypt'23), who constructed a pCPRF from group-based homomorphic secret-sharing but were limited to inner-product constraints in the constraint-hiding setting. Leveraging novel techniques for computing with distributed discrete logarithms (DDLog), we enable the non-interactive authentication of powers of linear combinations of shares of some value. This, in turn, allows us to express constraints with polynomially bounded Waring rank. \r\n\r\nOur construction is single-key, selectively secure, and supports an exponential-size domain.",

    "abstract": "We show a generic compiler from KEM to (Universally Composable) PAKE in the Random Oracle Model (ROM) and without requiring an Ideal Cipher.  The compiler is akin to Encrypted Key Exchange (EKE) by Bellovin-Merritt, but following the work of McQuoid et al. it uses only a 2-round Feistel to password-encrypt a KEM public key. The resulting PAKE incurs only insignificant cost overhead over the underlying KEM, and it is a secure UC PAKE if KEM is secure and key-anonymous under the Plaintext-Checking Attack (PCA).\r\n\r\nSeveral KEM-to-PAKE compilers were shown recently, secure under the OW-PCA and ANO-PCA assumptions on KEM, but all used an Ideal Cipher in addition to ROM.  While there are techniques for emulating ROM against quantum attackers, it is currently unknown how to extend many of such techniques to the Ideal Cipher Model.  Consequently, doing without the Ideal Cipher in protocol design makes the resulting construction a more plausible candidate for post-quantum secure PAKE if instantiated with post-quantum PCA-secure and anonymous KEM, such as the ML-KEM standard itself.\r\n\r\nOur construction and proofs build on many of the ideas underlying the KEM-to-PAKE compiler using 2-round Feistel given by McQuoid et al, but our protocol is more efficient and our proofs address limitations in the analysis therein.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a constant-round actively secure two-party computation protocol with small communication based on the ring learning with errors (RLWE) assumption with key-dependent message security. Our result builds on the recent BitGC protocol by Liu, Wang, Yang, and Yu (Eurocrypt 2025) with communication of one bit per gate for semi-honest security. First, we achieve a different manner of distributed garbling, where the global correlation is secret-shared among the two parties. The garbler always and only holds the garbled labels corresponding to the wire values when all inputs are zero, while the evaluator holds the labels corresponding to the real evaluation.  In the second phase, we run an authentication protocol that requires some extra communication, which allows two parties to check the correct computation of each gate by treating the ciphertext as commitments, now that the global key is distributed. For layered circuits, the extra communication for authentication is $o(1)$ bits per gate, resulting in total communication of $1+o(1)$ bits per gate. For generic circuits, the extra communication cost can be $1$ bit per gate in the worst case, and thus, the total communication cost would be 2 bits per gate.",

    "abstract": "Anamorphic encryption (AE), introduced by Persiano, Phan and Yung at Eurocrypt 22, allows to establish secure communication in scenarios where users might be forced to hand over their decryption keys to some hostile authority. Over the last few years, several work have improved our understanding of the primitive by proposing novel realizations, new security notions and studying inherent limitations. \r\nThis work makes progress, mainly, on this last line of research. \r\nWe show concrete realizations of so-called Anamorphic Resistant Encryption (ARE, for short). These are (public key) encryption schemes that, provably, cannot be turned anamorphic. \r\nWe also show that, under certain conditions, anamorphic encryption turns out to be equivalent to algorithm substitution attacks. This result allows to positively reinterpret our AREs as PKE schemes provably resistant to subversion attacks. To the best of our knowledge, these seem to be the first IND-CPA secure schemes that achieve subversion resistance without trust assumptions or non-black-box decomposition techniques. \r\nOur two AREs heavily rely, among other things, on a direct usage of extremely lossy functions: here the lossyness property is used in the constructions, rather than just in the proofs. The first construction is in the public parameters model and also requires iO. The second construction eliminates the need of both public parameters and iO, but is in the random oracle and relies on the novel concept of robust extremely lossy functions with group structure, a primitive that we define and (show how to) realize in this paper.",

    "abstract": "We study append-only set commitments with efficient updates and inclusion proofs, or cryptographic accumulators. In particular, we examine how often the inclusion proofs (or witnesses) for individual items must change as new items are added to the accumulated set. Using a compression argument, we show unconditionally that to accumulate a set of $n$ items, any construction with a succinct commitment ($O(\\lambda \\text{ polylog} \\ n)$ storage) must induce at least $\\omega(n)$ total witness updates as $n$ items are sequentially added. In a certain regime, we strengthen this bound to $\\Omega(n \\log n/\\log \\log n)$ total witness updates. These lower bounds hold not just in the worst case, but with overwhelming probability over a random choice of the accumulated set. Our results show that a close variant of the Merkle Mountain range, an elegant construction that has become popular in practice, is essentially optimal.",

    "abstract": "Can a sender commit to a long input without even reading all of it? Can a prover convince a verifier that an NP statement holds without  even reading the entire witness? Can a set of parties run a multiparty computation (MPC) protocol in the RAM model, without necessarily even reading their entire inputs? We show how to construct such \"doubly efficient\" schemes in a setting where parties can preprocess their input offline, but subsequently they can engage in many different protocol executions over this input in sublinear online time. We do so in the plain model, without any common setup. Our constructions rely on doubly efficient private information retrieval (DEPIR) as a building block and can be instantiated based on Ring LWE. \r\n\r\nIn more detail, we begin by constructing doubly efficient (interactive) commitments, where the sender preprocesses the input offline, and can later commit to this input to arbitrary  receivers in sublinear online time. Moreover, the sender  can open individual bits of the committed input in sublinear time.  We then use these commitments to implement doubly succinct (interactive) arguments, where the prover preprocesses the statement/witness offline, and can subsequently run many proof protocols to convince arbitrary verifiers of the statement's validity in sublinear online time. Furthermore, we augment these to get a doubly efficient \"commit, prove and locally open\" protocol, where the prover can commit to a long preprocessed input, prove that it satisfies some global property, and locally open individual bits, all in sublinear time. Finally, we leverage these tools to construct a RAM-MPC with malicious security in the plain model. Each party individually preprocesses its input offline, and can then run arbitrary MPC executions over this input with arbitrary other parties. The online run-time of each MPC execution is only proportional to the RAM run-time of the underlying program, that can be sublinear in the input size.",

    "abstract": "Indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) has seen remarkable theoretical progress, yet it remains impractical due to its high complexity and inefficiency. A common bottleneck in recent iO schemes is the reliance on bootstrapping techniques from functional encryption (FE) into iO, which requires recursively invoking the FE encryption algorithm for each input bit\u2014creating a significant barrier to practical iO schemes.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose diamond iO, a new lattice-based iO construction that replaces the costly recursive encryption process with lightweight matrix operations. Our construction is proven secure under the learning with errors (LWE) and evasive LWE assumptions, as well as our new assumption\u2014all-product LWE\u2014in the pseudorandom oracle model. By leveraging the FE scheme for pseudorandom functionalities introduced by Agrawal et al. (ePrint\u201924) in a non-black-box manner, we remove the reliance on prior FE-to-iO bootstrapping techniques and thereby significantly reduce complexity. A remaining challenge is to reduce our new assumption to standard assumptions such as LWE, further advancing the goal of a practical and sound iO construction.",

    "abstract": "Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) is a type of key exchange protocols secure against man-in-the-middle adversaries, in the setting where the two parties only agree upon a low-entropy \"password\" in advance. The first and arguably most well-studied PAKE protocol is Encrypted Key Exchange (EKE) (Bellovin and Marritt, 1992), and the standard security notion for PAKE is in the Universal Composability (UC) framework (Canetti et al., 2005). While the UC-security of EKE has been \"folklore\" knowledge for many years, a satisfactory formal proof has long been elusive.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we present a UC-security proof for the most common instantiation of EKE, which is based on hashed Diffie\u2013Hellman. Our proof is in the random oracle + ideal cipher models, and under the computational Diffie\u2013Hellman assumption. We thoroughly discuss the UC-security definition for PAKE, subtleties and pitfalls in the security proof, how to write a UC proof, and flaws in existing works; along the way we also present some philosophical discussions on security definitions and security proofs in general. In this way, we hope to draw attention to several understudied, underexplained or underappreciated aspects of the UC-security of EKE.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial can be viewed as a simplified version of the recent work by Januzelli, Roy and Xu (2025); however, we completely rewrite most of the materials there to make them much more approachable to beginners who have just learned the UC framework.",

    "abstract": "Cryptographic proof systems enable a verifier to be convinced of of a computation's correctness  without re-executing it; common efficiency requirements include both succinct proofs and fast verification.\r\nIn this work we put forth the general study of cryptographic proof systems with sublinear proving time (after a preprocessing).\r\nPrior work has achieved sublinear proving only for limited computational settings (e.g., vector commitments and lookup arguments), relying on specific assumptions or through non-black-box use of cryptographic primitives. In  this work we lift many of these limitations through the systematic study of a specific object: polynomial commitments (PC) with sublinear proving time, a choice motivated by the crucial role that PC play in the design of efficient cryptographic schemes.  \r\nOur main result is a simple construction of a PC with sublinear prover based on any vector commitment scheme (VC) and any preprocessing technique for fast polynomial evaluation. We prove that this PC satisfies evaluation binding, which is the standard security notion for PC, and show how to expand our construction to achieve the stronger notion of knowledge soundness (extractability). \r\nThe first application of our result is a construction of \"index-efficient\" SNARKs  meaning that the prover is  sublinear, after preprocessing, in the size of the index (i.e., the NP-relation describing the proven statement).  Our main technical contribution is a method to transform a class of standard Polynomial Interactive Oracle Proofs (PIOPs) into index-efficient PIOPs. Our construction of index-efficient SNARKs makes black-box use of such index-efficient PIOPs and a PC with sublinear prover. \r\nAs a corollary, this yields the first lookup argument for unstructured tables in which the prover is sublinear in the size of the table, while making only black-box use of a VC and thus allowing instantiations from generic assumptions such as collision-resistant hash functions. Prior lookup arguments with sublinear provers were only known with non-black-box use of cryptographic primitives, or from pairings. Finally, our last application is a transformation that builds UC-secure SNARKs from simulation-extractable ones, with an approximately linear overhead in proving time (as opposed to quadratic in prior work).",

    "abstract": "We introduce DART, a fully anonymous, account-based payment system designed to address a comprehensive set of real-world considerations, including regulatory compliance, while achieving constant transaction size. DART supports multiple asset types, enabling users to issue on-chain assets such as tokenized real-world assets. It ensures confidentiality and anonymity by concealing asset types, transaction amounts, balances, and the identities of both senders and receivers, while guaranteeing unlinkability between transactions. Our design provides a mechanism for asset-specific auditing. Issuers can designate asset-specific auditors for the assets they issue, with the system preserving the privacy of the auditor\u2019s identity to achieve asset type privacy. Only the designated auditor is authorized to decrypt transactions related to their associated asset, and users efficiently prove the association between the (hidden) asset type and the (hidden) designated auditor in their transactions. \r\n\r\nDART supports non-interactive payments, allowing an online sender to submit a transaction even when the receiver is offline, while still incorporating a receiver affirmation mechanism that captures the real-world compliance consideration where the receiver must confirm (or deny) an incoming transaction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scheme of this kind in the permissionless setting. To accommodate all eventualities, DART also incorporates a reversibility mechanism, enabling senders to reclaim funds from pending transactions if the receiver\u2019s affirmation is not yet provided. Finally, it offers a privacy-preserving proof of balance (per asset type) mechanism. \r\n\r\nOur system achieves full anonymity while supporting concurrent incoming and outgoing transactions, resolving a common issue that plagues many account-based anonymous systems. We further demonstrate how our system supports multi-party transactions, allowing payment to multiple receivers in one transaction efficiently. We provide a full formal model in the Universal Composition (UC) setting, as well as a UC protocol realization.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a decentralized and leaderless sealed bid auction model for dynamic pricing of intents across blockchain networks. We leverage Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) to improve pricing while ensuring fairness and decentralization. By addressing the vulnerabilities of current centralized or static pricing mechanisms, our approach fosters transparent, secure, and competitive price discovery. We further enhance the confidentiality of intents through Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), and Trusted Execution Environments (TEE). Our novel methodology mitigates the risks of frontrunning and centralization while preserving the rapid settlement times essential to decentralized finance (DeFi).",

    "abstract": "The rational secret sharing problem (RSS) considers incentivizing rational parties to share their received information to reconstruct a correctly shared secret. Halpern and Teague (STOC'04) demonstrate that solving the RSS problem deterministically with explicitly bounded runtime is impossible, if parties prefer learning the secret than not learning, and they prefer fewer other parties to learn. \r\n\r\nTo overcome this impossibility result, we propose RSS with competition. We consider a slightly different yet sensible preference profile: Each party prefers to learn the secret early and prefers fewer parties learning before them. This preference profile changes the information-hiding dynamics among parties in prior works: First, those who have learned the secret are indifferent towards or even prefer informing others later; second, the competition to learn the secret earlier among different access groups in the access structure facilitates information sharing inside an access group. As a result, we are able to construct the first deterministic RSS algorithm that terminates in at most two rounds. Additionally, our construction does not employ any cryptographic machinery (being fully game-theoretic and using the underlying secret-sharing scheme as a black-box) nor requires the knowledge of the parties' exact utility function. Furthermore, we consider general access structures.",

    "abstract": "$\\textit{Linkable ring signatures}$ (LRS) allow a user to sign anonymously on behalf of a ring, while maintaining linkability\u2014two signatures from the same signer are publicly identified, i.e., linked. This linkability makes LRS suitable to prevent double-voting in classical, $\\textit{plurality}$ voting protocols\u2014each voter casts one vote and the candidate with the most votes wins the election. \r\n\r\n    Several voting scenarios rely on (generalized) rules rather than plurality. For example, in $\\textit{ranked voting}$, voters submit a ranking of the candidates, and the outcome is a function of these rankings. Such generalized voting rules are common in social choice theory, and have recently found their way into blockchain governance, e.g., for prioritizing (voting on) proposed (candidate)  projects. However, unlike plurality voting, using LRS for voters to sign their votes (rankings) does not guarantee vote privacy as one can observe the rankings of each individual voter, which, depending on the scoring rule, is more information than what the outcome of the election offers. \r\n\r\nWe introduce $k$-$\\textit{linkable ring signatures}$ ($k$-LRS) as a primitive for simultaneously achieving anonymity and privacy in generalized voting. A $k$-LRS scheme has the following properties: \r\n   ($k$-)$\\textit{Anonymity}$: a user can sign anonymously (on behalf of the ring) up to $k$ times, so that even an unbounded adversary cannot link his signatures.\r\n   ($k$-)$\\textit{Linkability}$: If any signer signs more than $k$ times, all his signatures are publicly linked $\\textit{(individual $k$-linkability)}$; and, any set of $c$ signers cannot generate more than $k\\cdot c$ unlinked signatures $\\textit{(collective $k$-linkability)}$.\r\n\r\n    We provide two constructions of $k$-LRS: one is from the DDH, and the other is from SIS (hence post-quantum). Finally, we show how $k$-LRS can be applied to a broad range of voting rules, including $\\textit{score voting}$, $\\textit{multi-voting}$, and $\\textit{Borda}$. Our protocols are non-interactive voting\u2014each voter just posts a message on a bulletin board\u2014which highlights the potential of $k$-LRS in blockchain-governance scenarios.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a general template for building garbled circuits with low communication, under the decisional composite residuosity (DCR) assumption. For the case of layered Boolean circuits, we can garble a circuit of size $s$ with communication proportional to $O(s/\\log\\log s)$ bits, plus an additive factor that is polynomial in the security parameter. For layered arithmetic circuits with $B$-bounded integer computation, we obtain a similar result: the garbled arithmetic circuit has size $O(s/\\log\\log s) \\cdot (\\lambda + \\log B)$ bits, where $\\lambda$ is the security parameter. These are the first constructions of general-purpose, garbled circuits with sublinear size, without relying on heavy tools like indistinguishability obfuscation or attribute-based and fully homomorphic encryption.\r\n\r\nTo achieve these results, our main technical tool is a new construction of a form of homomorphic secret sharing where some of the inputs are semi-private, that is, known to one of the evaluating parties. Through a new relinearisation technique that allows performing arbitrary additions and multiplications on semi-private shares, we build such an HSS scheme that supports evaluating any function of the form $C(x) \\cdot C'(y)$, where $C$ is any polynomially-sized circuit applied to the semi-private input $y$, and $C'$ is a restricted-multiplication (or, NC1) circuit applied to the private input $x$. This significantly broadens the expressiveness of prior known HSS constructions.",

In this scenario, the best known protocol due to Elsheimy, Loss, and Papamanthou (ASIACRYPT `24) achieves a round complexity of $(1+\\epsilon)\\cdot f$ for some constant $0<\\epsilon<1$. We begin by introducing an improvement to the Elsheimy et al. approach which can be used to obtain the first polynomial-time early stopping agreement protocols in the $t<n/2$ corruption regime which achieve a complexity of $f+O(\\sqrt{f})$. We then instantiate our generic framework with refined components to obtain a very concretely efficient protocol with a round complexity of only $f + 6\\lceil\\sqrt{f}\\rceil+6$ and polynomial communication complexity. Finally, we show that it is possible to come within one round of the optimal round complexity by presenting a broadcast protocol based on the exponential information gathering approach, which achieves a round complexity of $\\min\\{f + 3, t + 1\\}$, albeit with exponential communication complexity.",

    "abstract": "Folding is a technique for building efficient succinct proof systems. Many existing folding protocols rely on the discrete-log based Pedersen commitment scheme, and are therefore not post-quantum secure and require a large (256-bit) field. Recently, Boneh and Chen constructed LatticeFold, a folding protocol using lattice-based commitments which is plausibly post-quantum secure and can operate with small (64-bit) fields. For knowledge soundness, LatticeFold requires the prover to provide a range proof on all the input witnesses using bit-decomposition, and this slows down the prover. In this work we present LatticeFold+, a very different lattice-based folding protocol that improves on LatticeFold in every respect: the prover is five to ten times faster, the verification circuit is simpler, and the folding proofs are shorter. To do so we develop two novel lattice techniques. First, we develop a new purely algebraic range proof which is much more efficient than the one in LatticeFold, and may be of independent interest. We further shrink the proof using double commitments (commitments of commitments). Second, we show how to fold statements about double commitments using a new sumcheck-based transformation.",

    "abstract": "In block ciphers, the attacker should not be able to distinguish a block cipher from a random permutation, making the existence of a distinguisher important. Cryptanalysis of the reduced-round variants of block ciphers is also important in cryptographic design. AES is the most widely used block cipher, and currently, the best-known distinguisher for 5-round AES has a data and time complexity of $2^{29.95}$ with a success probability of 55\\%. In this paper, we propose the fully active exchanged boomerang and multiple exchanged boomerang distinguishers for 5-round AES, based on the retracing boomerang key-recovery attack. The fully active exchanged boomerang distinguisher utilizes the probability that either each byte of the diagonal of the returned plaintext pair is fully active, or the diagonal is inactive for all diagonals. This probability is very high, but we enhance it using the friends pair technique to distinguish a block cipher from a random permutation. The multiple exchanged boomerang distinguisher utilizes the fact that there are three trails where the probability of one diagonal of the returned plaintext pair being inactive is higher than the random probability, and one trail where it is equal to the random probability. This 5-round distinguisher has a complexity of $2^{27.08}$ and a success probability of 82\\%, which represents a new best-known result for the secret-key distinguisher on 5-round AES.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of quantum computing has ushered in a new era of post-quantum cryptography, urgently demanding quantum-resistant digital signatures to secure modern communications and transactions. Among NIST-standardized candidates, Falcon\u2014a compact lattice-based signature scheme\u2014stands out for its suitability in size-sensitive applications. In this paper, we present cuFalcon, a high-throughput GPU implementation of Falcon that addresses its computational bottlenecks through adaptive parallel strategies.  At the operational level, we optimize Falcon key components for GPU architectures through memory-efficient FFT, adaptive parallel ffSampling, and a compact computation mode. For signature-level optimization, we implement three versions of cuFalcon: the raw key version, the expanded key version, and the balanced version, which achieves a trade-off between efficiency and memory usage. Additionally, we design batch processing, streaming mechanisms, and memory pooling to handle multiple signature tasks efficiently. Ultimately, performance evaluations show significant improvements, with the raw key version achieving 172k signatures per second and the expanded key version reaching 201k.  Compared to the raw key version, the balanced version achieves a 7% improvement in throughput, while compared to the expanded key version, it reduces memory usage by 70%. Furthermore, our raw key version implementation outperforms the reference implementation by 36.75 $\\times$ and achieves a 2.94$\\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art GPU implementation.",

    "abstract": "We study the round-complexity of secure multi-party computation (MPC) in the post-quantum regime where honest parties and communication channels are classical but the adversary can be a quantum machine. Our focus is on the $\\mathit{fully}$ black-box setting where both the construction as well as the security reduction are black-box in nature. In this context, Chia, Chung, Liu, and Yamakawa [FOCS'22] demonstrated the infeasibility of achieving standard simulation-based security within constant rounds, unless $\\mathbf{NP} \\subseteq \\mathbf{BQP}$. This outcome leaves crucial feasibility questions unresolved. Specifically, it remains unknown whether black-box constructions are achievable within polynomial rounds; additionally, the existence of constant-round constructions with respect to $\\epsilon$-$\\mathit{simulation}$, a relaxed yet useful alternative to the standard simulation notion, remains unestablished. \r\n\r\nThis work provides positive answers to the aforementioned questions. We introduce the first black-box construction for post-quantum MPC in polynomial rounds, from the minimal assumption of post-quantum semi-honest oblivious transfers. In the two-party scenario, our construction requires only $\\omega(1)$ rounds. These results have already found application in the oracle separation between classical-communication quantum MPC and $\\mathbf{P} = \\mathbf{NP}$ in the recent work of Kretschmer, Qian, and Tal [STOC'25].\r\n\r\nAs for $\\epsilon$-simulation, Chia, Chung, Liang, and Yamakawa [CRYPTO'22] resolved the issue for the two-party setting, leaving the general multi-party setting as an open question. We complete the picture by presenting the first black-box and constant-round construction in the multi-party setting. Our construction can be instantiated using various standard post-quantum primitives including lossy public-key encryption, linearly homomorphic public-key encryption, or dense cryptosystems.\r\n\r\nEn route, we obtain a black-box and constant-round post-quantum commitment that achieves a weaker version of the standard 1-many non-malleability, from the minimal assumption of post-quantum one-way functions. Besides its utility in our post-quantum MPC construction, this commitment scheme also reduces the assumption used in the lower bound of quantum parallel repetition recently established by Bostanci, Qian, Spooner, and Yuen [STOC'24]. We anticipate that it will find more applications in the future.",

Input $x$ is called a $\\textit{streaming}$ input if it is only available on-the-fly as part of an ongoing data generation/streaming process, and not available at once. We also propose a new notion of zero-knowledge features for IVsC that guarantees the proof can be incrementally verified w.r.t.~an encrypted digest, where the proof and digest hide the full data stream. We design zero-knowledge IVsC from a wide variety of standard falsifiable assumptions (such as decision-linear/sub-exponential DDH/LWE).\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also introduce a new notion of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, that we call $\\textit{step-by-step}$ zero-knowledge protocols. Such protocols have strong zero-knowledge guarantees, wherein the prover's entire internal memory is simulatable at any point during proof generation. That is, unlike standard zero-knowledge proofs, where only the final proof is simulatable, we can also simulate prover's state at every step of the computation. Such proof systems will be useful in settings where an adversary could corrupt an honest prover even before it generates the full proof. We show that a zero-knowledge IVsC system can be used (almost) as a black-box to design step-by-step zero-knowledge proof systems, therefore secure under standard assumptions.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a high-performance architecture for accelerating Multi-Scalar Multiplication (MSM) on ASIC platforms, targeting cryptographic applications with high throughput demands. Unlike prior MSM accelerators that focus solely on efficient processing elements (PEs), our chiplet-based design optimally balances area, power, and computational throughput. We identify a mixed window configuration of 12- and 13-bit windows that enables an efficient multi-PE integration of 10 PEs per chiplet. Our single-PE design achieves a 1.37x speedup and 1.3x area reduction over prior works, while the multi-PE chiplet design improves the area-time product by 2.2x, offering scalability, lower production costs, and higher manufacturing yields.",

    "abstract": "Current adaptively secure identity-based encryption (IBE) constructions from lattices are unable to achieve a good balance among the master public key size, secret key size, modulus and reduction loss. All existing lattice-based IBE schemes share a common restriction: the modulus is quadratic in the trapdoor norm.\r\nIn this work, we remove this restriction and present a new adaptively secure IBE scheme from lattices in the standard model, which improves the state-of-the-art construction proposed by Abla et al. (TCC 2021) and achieves asymptotically better efficiency. More precisely, we achieve the asymptotically minimal number of public vectors among all the existing schemes, along with a significantly smaller modulus compared to the scheme by Abla et al. (TCC 2021). Furthermore, our scheme enjoys the smallest Gaussian width of the secret key among all existing schemes and has the same tightness as Abla et al.'s scheme.\r\nWe propose a novel cross-multiplication design for our IBE scheme, along with several novel tools and techniques, including: (a) a homomorphic computation algorithm that outputs BGG+-style encoding with two distinct-norm trapdoors; (b) a sampling algorithm with hybrid Gaussian outputs; and (c) a partial rerandomization algorithm. These new tools and techniques are general and could find rich applications in lattice-based cryptography.",

    "abstract": "Garbled Circuit (GC) is a fundamental tool in cryptography, especially in secure multiparty computation.  Most garbling schemes follow a gate-by-gate paradigm.  The communication cost is proportional to the circuit size times the security parameter $\\lambda$.\r\n\r\nRecently, Heath, Kolesnikov and Ng (Eurocrypt 2024) partially transcend the circuit size barrier by considering large gates.  To garble an arbitrary $n$-input $m$-output gate, their scheme requires $O(nm\\lambda) + 2^nm$ bits of communication.  The security relies on circular correlation robust hash functions (CCRH).\r\n\r\nWe further improve the communication cost to $O(n \\lambda_{\\sf DCR} + m\\lambda)$, removing the exponential term.  The computation cost is $O(2^n (\\lambda_{\\sf DCR})^2)$, dominated by $O(2^nn)$ exponentiations. Our construction is built upon recent progress in DCR-based Homomorphic Secret Sharing (HSS), so it additionally relies on the decisional composite residuosity (DCR) assumption.\r\n\r\nAs an intermediate step, we construct programmable distributed point functions with decomposable keys, relying on the DCR assumption.

    "abstract": "To counteract side-channel attacks, a masking scheme splits each intermediate variable into $n$ shares and transforms each elementary operation (e.g., field addition and multiplication) to the masked correspondence called gadget, such that intrinsic noise in the leakages renders secret recovery infeasible in practice. A simple and efficient security notion is the probing model ensuring that any $n-1$ shares are independently distributed from the secret input. One requirement of the probing model is the noise in the leakages should increase with the number of shares, largely restricting the side-channel security in the low-noise scenario. Another security notion for masking, called the random probing model, allows each variable to leak with a probability $p$. While this model reflects the physical reality of side channels much better, it brings significant overhead. At Crypto 2018, Ananth et al. proposed a modular approach that can provide random probing security for any security level by expanding small base gadgets with $n$ share recursively, such that the tolerable leakage probability $p$ decreases with $n$ while the security increases exponentially with the recursion depth of expansion. Then, Bela\u00efd et al. provided a formal security definition called Random Probing Expandability (RPE) and an explicit framework using the modular approach to construct masking schemes at Crypto 2020.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we investigate how to tighten the RPE definition via allowing the dependent failure probabilities of multiple inputs, which results in a new definition called related RPE. It can be directly used for the expansion of multiplication gates and reduce the complexity of the base multiplication gadget from $\\mathcal{O}(n^2\\log n)$ proposed at Asiacrypt 2021 to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ and maintain the same security level. Furthermore, we describe a method to expand any gates (rather than only multiplication) with the related RPE gadgets.\r\nBesides, we denote another new RPE definition called Multiple inputs RPE used for the expansion of multiple-input gates composed with any gates. Utilizing these methods, we reduce the complexity of 3-share circuit compiler to $\\mathcal{O}(|C|\\cdot\\kappa^{3.2})$, where $|C|$ is the size of the unprotected circuit and the protection failure probability of the global circuit is $2^{-\\kappa}$. In comparison, the complexity of the state-of-the-art work, proposed at Eurocrypt 2021, is $\\mathcal{O}(|C|\\cdot\\kappa^{3.9})$ for the same value of $n$. Additionally, we provide the construction of a 5-share circuit compiler with a complexity $\\mathcal{O}(|C|\\cdot\\kappa^{2.8})$.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we construct distortion-free and unforgeable watermarks for language models and generative agents. The watermarked output cannot be forged by a adversary nor removed by the adversary without significantly degrading model output quality. That is, the watermarked output is distortion-free: the watermarking algorithm does not noticeably change the quality of the model output and without the public detection key, no efficient adversary can distinguish output that is watermarked from outputs which are not. The core of the watermarking schemes involve embedding a message and publicly-verifiable digital signature in the generated model output. The message and signature can be extracted during the detection phase and verified by any authorized entity that has a public key. We show that, assuming the standard cryptographic assumption of one-way functions, we can construct distortion-free and unforgeable watermark schemes. Our framework relies on analyzing the inaccessible entropy of the watermarking schemes based on computational entropy notions derived from the existence of one-way functions.",

    "abstract": "Floating-point arithmetic plays a central role in computer science and is used in various domains where precision and computational scale are essential. One notable application is in machine learning, where Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) can play a crucial role in safeguarding user privacy. In this paper, we focus on TFHE and develop novel homomorphic operators designed to enable the construction of precise and adaptable homomorphic floating-point operations. Integrating floating-point arithmetic within the context of FHE is particularly challenging due to constraints such as small message space and the lack of information during computation. Despite these challenges, we were able to determine parameters for common precisions (e.g., 32-bit, 64-bit) and achieve remarkable computational speeds, with 32-bit floating-point additions completing in 2.5 seconds and multiplications in approximately 1 second in a multi-threaded environment. These metrics provide empirical evidence of the efficiency and practicality of our proposed methods, which significantly outperform previous efforts. Our results demonstrate a significant advancement in the practical application of FHE, making it more viable for real-world scenarios and bridging the gap between theoretical encryption techniques and practical usability.",

    "abstract": "Publicly identifiable abort is a critical feature for ensuring accountability in outsourced computations using secure multiparty computation (MPC). Despite its importance, no prior work has specifically addressed identifiable abort in the context of outsourced computations. In this paper, we present the first MPC protocol that supports publicly identifiable abort with minimal overhead for external clients. Our approach minimizes client-side computation by requiring only a few pseudorandom function evaluations per input. On the server side, the verification process involves lightweight linear function evaluations using homomorphic encryption. This results in verification times of a few nanoseconds per operation for servers, with client overhead being approximately two orders of magnitude lower. Additionally, the publicly verifiable nature of our protocol reduces client input/output costs compared to SPDZ-based protocols, on which we base our protocol. For example, in secure aggregation use cases, our protocol achieves over twice the efficiency during the offline phase and up to an 18 % speedup in the online phase, significantly outperforming SPDZ.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, the introduction of advanced cryptographic protocols operating on large finite fields $\\mathbb{F}_q$ has raised the need for efficient cryptographic primitives in this setting, commonly referred to as Arithmetization-Oriented (AO). The cryptanalysis of AO hash functions is essentially done through the study of the CICO problem on the underlying permutation. Two recent works at Crypto 2024 and Asiacrypt 2024 managed to solve the CICO problem much more efficiently than traditional Gr\u00f6bner basis methods, using respectively advanced Gr\u00f6bner basis techniques and resultants.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose an attack framework based on resultants that applies to a wide range of AO permutations and improves significantly upon these two recent works. Our improvements mainly come from an efficient reduction procedure that we propose and rigorously analyze, taking advantage of fast multivariate multiplication. We present the most efficient attacks on Griffin, Arion, Anemoi, and Rescue. We show that most variants of Griffin, Arion and Anemoi fail to reach the claimed security level. For the first time, we successfully break a parameter set of Rescue, namely its $512$-bit security variant. The presented theory and complexity estimates are backed up with experimental attacks. Notably, we practically find CICO solutions for $8$ out of $10$ rounds of Griffin, $11$ out of $20$ rounds of Anemoi,  $6$ out of $18$ rounds of Rescue, improving by respectively $1$, $3$ and $1$ rounds on the previous best practical attacks.",

    "abstract": "Secure key leasing (SKL) is an advanced encryption functionality that allows a secret key holder to generate a quantum decryption key and securely lease it to a user. Once the user returns the quantum decryption key (or provides a classical certificate confirming its deletion), they lose their decryption capability. Previous works on public key encryption with SKL (PKE-SKL) have only considered the single-key security model, where the adversary receives at most one quantum decryption key. However, this model does not accurately reflect real-world applications of PKE-SKL. To address this limitation, we introduce collusion-resistant security for PKE-SKL (denoted as PKE-CR-SKL). In this model, the adversary can adaptively obtain multiple quantum decryption keys and access a verification oracle which validates the correctness of queried quantum decryption keys. Importantly, the size of the public key and ciphertexts must remain independent of the total number of generated quantum decryption keys. We present the following constructions:\r\n\r\n- A PKE-CR-SKL scheme based on the learning with errors (LWE) assumption.\r\n\r\n- An attribute-based encryption scheme with collusion-resistant SKL (ABE-CR-SKL), also based on the LWE assumption.\r\n\r\n- An ABE-CR-SKL scheme with classical certificates, relying on multi-input ABE with polynomial arity.",

    "abstract": "Recently, there is a growing need for SNARKs to operate over a broader range of algebraic structures, and one important structure is Galois ring. We present transparent SNARK schemes over arbitrary Galois rings. Compared with Rinocchio scheme in Ganesh et al.

Using this expander code, we then extend the Brakedown commitment scheme in Golovnev et al. (CRYPTO 2023) to Galois rings. By combining the Libra framework in Xie et al. (CRYPTO 2019), we present a transparent SNARK for log-space uniform circuits over Galois rings, achieving $O(n)$ prover time, $O(\\sqrt{n})$ proof size, and $O(\\sqrt{n})$ verifier time. And by combining HyperPlonk in Chen et al.

    "abstract": "The adaptive security of threshold signatures considers an adversary that adaptively corrupts users to learn their secret key shares and states. Crites, Komlo, and Maller (Crypto 2023) proposed Sparkle, the first threshold signature scheme in the pairing-free discrete-log setting to be proved adaptively secure. However, its proof of full adaptive security requires the algebraic group model (AGM) and is based on an interactive assumption. Bacho, Loss, Tessaro, Wagner, and Zhu (Eurocrypt 2024) proposed Twinkle, whose full adaptive security can be based on the standard DDH assumption only.\r\n\r\nWe propose Dazzle and Dazzle-T, adaptively secure threshold signature schemes based on DDH without the AGM, the same assumption and model as Twinkle. Our schemes improve upon Twinkle in signature size, round complexity, and/or security tightness. In particular, Dazzle and Dazzle-T both have signatures that are shorter than Twinkle by one group element. Regarding the round complexity and tightness, Twinkle is three-round and non-tight. Our Dazzle is two-round and has the same security loss as Twinkle, while Dazzle-T is three-round and fully tight.\r\n\r\nWe achieve our improvements by optimizing the underlying single-party signature scheme and showing that the single-party scheme can be transformed to a threshold scheme by a simpler transformation than that of Twinkle.",

    "abstract": "Software watermarking for cryptographic functionalities enables embedding an arbitrary message (a mark) into a cryptographic function. An extraction algorithm, when provided with a (potentially unauthorized) circuit, retrieves either the embedded mark or a special symbol unmarked indicating the absence of a mark. It is difficult to modify or remove the embedded mark without destroying the functionality of a marked function. Previous works have primarily employed black-box extraction techniques, where the extraction algorithm requires only input-output access to the circuit rather than its internal descriptions (white-box extraction). Zhandry (CRYPTO 2021) identified several challenges in watermarking public-key encryption (PKE) with black-box extraction and introduced the notion of privacy for white-box watermarking against classical adversaries. Kitagawa and Nishimaki (Journal of Cryptology 37(3)) extended watermarking techniques to pseudorandom functions (PRFs) and PKE in the presence of quantum adversaries, enabling extraction from pirate quantum circuits but failing to achieve privacy.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we investigate white-box watermarking for digital signatures secure against quantum adversaries. Our constructions enable the extraction of embedded marks from the description of a pirate quantum circuit that produces valid signatures while ensuring that black-box access to a marked signing function does not reveal information about the embedded mark. We define and construct white-box watermarking signatures that are secure against quantum adversaries, leveraging the leaning with errors (LWE) assumption and quantum fully homomorphic encryption. Furthermore, we highlight that privacy concerns are even more critical in the context of signatures than in PKE. We also present a compelling practical application of white-box watermarking signatures.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we explore the concept of universal copy protection for signatures. We define universal copy protection as a mechanism that transforms any quantumly secure signature scheme into a copy-protected variant without altering the verification key or verification algorithm. This approach is preferable to developing specific copy-protected signature schemes, as it allows existing schemes to be secured without modifying their published verification keys. We demonstrate that universal copy protection for all quantum secure signatures is impossible by leveraging our white-box watermarking signatures secure against quantum adversaries.",

    "abstract": "The study of attack algorithms for the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem is crucial for the cryptanalysis of LWE-based cryptosystems. The BKW algorithm has gained significant attention as an important combinatorial attack for solving LWE. However, its exponential time and memory requirements severely limit its practical applications, even with medium-sized parameters. In this paper, we present a memory-efficient BKW algorithm for LWE, which extends Bogos's work [Asiacrypt'16] on the Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem. While their work improved efficiency, it overlooked the high memory demands of the BKW algorithm. We address this with two key improvements. First, we propose an efficient reduction technique for low-memory regimes, \\(c\\)-sum-PCS-reduce, which combines the \\(c\\)-sum technique with Parallel Collision Search (PCS) to achieve a better time-memory trade-off. Second, we present an improved memory-optimized finite automaton for our optimized BKW algorithm by incorporating several efficient memory-saving reduction techniques and pruning potential high-memory paths. Our algorithm, using graphs as a meta tool, can automatically identify the optimal reduction path within the graph, aiming to reduce both time and memory complexities. Compared to the state-of-the-art coded-BKW in the lattice-estimator, our algorithm achieves time complexity improvements ranging from \\(2^{3.3}\\) to \\(2^{26.2}\\). Furthermore, memory complexity is improved, with reductions ranging from \\(2^{9.7}\\) to \\(2^{71.3}\\).",

    "abstract": "Garbling schemes are a fundamental cryptographic tool for enabling private computations and ensuring that nothing leaks beyond the output. As a widely studied primitive, significant efforts have been made to reduce their size. Until recently, all such schemes followed the Lindell and Pinkas paradigm for Boolean circuits (JoC 2009), where each gate is represented as a set of ciphertexts computed using only symmetric-key primitives. However, this approach is inherently limited to \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udf06) bits per gate, where \ud835\udf06 is the security parameter. Recently, it has been shown that achieving smaller garbled circuit size is possible under stronger assumptions, such as variants of Learning with Errors (LWE) or Indistinguishability Obfuscation (iO). In addition to requiring high-end cryptography, none of these constructions is black-box in the underlying cryptographic primitives, a key advantage of prior work. In this paper, we\r\npresent the first approach to garbling Boolean circuits that makes a black-box use of a group and uses \ud835\udc5c(\ud835\udf06) bits per gate.\r\n\r\nBuilding on a novel application of the Reverse Multiplication-Friendly Embeddings (RMFE) paradigm (Cascudo et al., CRYPTO 2018), We introduce a new packing mechanism for garbling schemes, that packs boolean values into integers and leverage techniques for arithmetic garbling over integer rings. Our results introduce two new succinct schemes that achieve improved rates by a factor of\u221a\ufe01 log \ud835\udf06, retaining the black-box usage. (1) Our first scheme is proven in the Generic Group model (GGM) for circuits with \u03a9(\u221a\ufe01 log \ud835\udf06) width, obtaining a garbled circuit size of \ud835\udf06 \u00b7 |C|/\u221a\ufe01 log(\ud835\udf06). (2) Our second scheme is proven in the plain model under the Power-DDH assumption, attaining a garbled circuit size of \ud835\udf06 \u00b7 (|C|/\u221a\ufe01 log(\ud835\udf06) + poly(\ud835\udf06) \u00b7 depth(C), but is restricted to layered circuits. Our schemes are the first to achieve sublinear (in \ud835\udf06) cost per gate under assumptions that do not imply fully homomorphic encryption; in addition, our scheme is also the first to achieve this while making a black-box use of cryptography.",

    "abstract": "Secure computation enables mutually distrusting parties to jointly compute a function on their secret inputs, while revealing nothing beyond the function output. A long-running challenge is understanding the required communication complexity of such protocols \u2013 in particular, when communication can be sublinear in the circuit representation size of the desired function. While several techniques have demonstrated the viability of sublinear secure computation in the two-party setting, known methods for the corresponding multi-party setting rely either on fully homomorphic encryption, non-standard hardness assumptions, or are limited to a small number of parties. In this work, we expand the study of multi-party sublinear secure computation by demonstrating sublinear-communication 10-party computation from various combinations of standard hardness assumptions. In particular, our contributions show:\r\n\r\n\u2013 8-party homomorphic secret sharing under the hardness of (DDH or DCR), the superpolynomial hardness of LPN, and the existence of constant-depth pseudorandom generators;\r\n\u2013 A general framework for achieving (N + M )-party sublinear secure computation using M-party homomorphic secret sharing for NC1 and correlated symmetric PIR.\r\n\r\nTogether, our constructions imply the existence of a 10-party MPC protocol with sublinear computation. At the core of our techniques lies a novel series of computational approaches based on homomorphic secret sharing.",

    "abstract": "Masking is a common countermeasure against side-channel attacks that encodes secrets into multiple shares, each of which may be subject to leakage. A key question is under what leakage conditions, and to what extent, does increasing the number of shares actually improve the security of these secrets. Although this question has been studied extensively in low-SNR regimes, scenarios where the adversary obtains substantial information\u2014such as on low-noise processors or through static power analysis\u2014have remained underexplored.\r\nIn this paper, we address this gap by deriving necessary and sufficient noise requirements for masking security in both standalone encodings and linear gadgets. We introduce a decomposition technique that reduces the relationship between an extended-field variable and its leakage into subproblems involving linear combinations of the variable\u2019s bits. By working within binary subfields, we derive optimal bounds and then lift these results back to the extended field.\r\nBeyond binary fields, we also present a broader framework for analyzing masking security in other structures, including prime fields. As an application, we prove a conjecture by Dziembowski et al. (TCC 2016), which states that for an additive group \\(\\mathbb{G}\\) with its largest subgroup \\(\\mathbb{H}\\), a \\(\\delta\\)-noisy leakage satisfying \\(\\delta < 1 - \\tfrac{|\\mathbb{H}|}{|\\mathbb{G}|}\\) ensures that masking enhances the security of the secret.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we prove that the supersingular isogeny problem (Isogeny), endomorphism ring problem (EndRing) and maximal order problem (MaxOrder) are equivalent under probabilistic polynomial time reductions, unconditionally.\r\nIsogeny-based cryptography is founded on the presumed hardness of these problems, and their interconnection is at the heart of the design and analysis of cryptosystems like the SQIsign digital signature scheme. Previously known reductions relied on unproven assumptions such as the generalized Riemann hypothesis. In this work, we present unconditional reductions, and extend this network of equivalences to the problem of computing the lattice of all isogenies between two supersingular elliptic curves (HomModule).\r\nFor cryptographic applications, one requires computational problems to be hard on average for random instances. It is well-known that if Isogeny is hard (in the worst case), then it is hard for random instances. We extend this result by proving that if any of the above-mentionned classical problems is hard in the worst case, then all of them are hard on average. In particular, if there exist hard instances of Isogeny, then all of Isogeny, EndRing, MaxOrder and HomModule are hard on average.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain interoperability solutions allow users to hold and transfer assets among different chains, and in so doing reap the benefits of each chain. To fully reap the benefits of multi-chain financial operations, it is paramount to support interoperability and cross-chain transactions also on Layer-2 networks, in particular payment channel networks (PCNs). Nevertheless, existing works on Layer-2 interoperability solutions still involve on-chain events, which limits their scalability and throughput. In this work, we present X-Transfer, the first secure, scalable, and fully off-chain protocol that allows payments across different PCNs. We formalize and prove the security of X-Transfer against rational adversaries with a game theoretic analysis. In order to boost efficiency and scalability, X-Transfer also performs transaction aggregation to increase channel liquidity and transaction throughput while simultaneously minimizing payment routing fees.  Our empirical evaluation of X-Transfer shows that X-Transfer achieves at least twice as much throughput compared to the baseline of no transaction aggregation, confirming X-Transfer's efficiency.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel scheme for securely computing the AND operation, without requiring additional online randomness. Building on the work of Nikova et al., our construction extends security beyond the first order while ensuring a uniform output distribution and resilience against glitches up to a specified threshold. This result addresses a longstanding open problem in side-channel-resistant masking schemes.\r\nOur approach is based on a new method of share clustering, inspired by finite affine geometry, enabling simultaneous consideration of both security and uniformity. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this clustering-based framework can be applied to higher-order protection of ciphers like Ascon under a fully deterministic masking regime. \r\nBy eliminating the need for online randomness within the protected circuit, our work expands the practical scope of efficient and higher-order masking schemes for resource constraint applications.",

    "abstract": "We construct a novel code-based blind signature scheme, us- ing the Matrix Equivalence Digital Signature (MEDS) group action. The scheme is built using similar ideas to the Schnorr blind signature scheme and CSI-Otter, but uses additional public key and commitment informa- tion to overcome the difficulties that the MEDS group action faces: lack of module structure (present in Schnorr), lack of a quadratic twist (present in CSI-Otter), and non-commutativity of the acting group. We address security concerns related to public key validation, and prove the security of our protocol in the random oracle model, using the security framework of Kastner, Loss, and Xu, under a variant of the Inverse Matrix Code Equivalence problem and a mild heuristic assumption.",

    "abstract": "We show that the randomized TFHE bootstrapping technique of Bourse and Izabech\u00e9ne provides a form of sanitization which is error-simulatable. This means that the randomized bootstrap can be used not only for sanitization of ciphertexts (i.e. to hide the function that has been computed), but that it can also be used in server-assisted threshold decryption. Thus we extend the server-assisted threshold decryption method of Passel\u00e9gue and Stehl\u00e9 (ASIACRYPT '24) to FHE schemes which have small ciphertext modulus (such as TFHE). In addition the error-simulatable sanitization enables us to obtain FuncCPA security for TFHE essentially for free.",

    "abstract": "NIST has standardized ML-KEM and ML-DSA as replacements for pre-quantum key exchanges and digital signatures. Both schemes have already seen analysis with respect to side-channels, and first fully masked implementations of ML-DSA have been published. Previous attacks have focused on unprotected implementations or assumed only hiding countermeasures to be in-place. Thus, in contrast to ML-KEM, the threat of side-channel attacks for protected implementations of ML-DSA is mostly unclear.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we analyze the side-channel vulnerability of masked ML-DSA implementations. We first systematically assess the vulnerability of several potential points of attacks in different leakage models using information theory. Then, we explain how an adversary could launch first, second, and higher-order attacks using a recently presented framework for side-channel information in lattice-based schemes. In this context, we propose a filtering technique that allows the framework to solve for the secret key from a large number of hints; this had previously been prevented by numerical instabilities. We simulate the presented attacks and discuss the relation to the information-theoretic analysis.\r\n\r\nFinally, we carry out relevant attacks on a physical device, discuss recent masked implementations, and instantiate a countermeasure against the most threatening attacks. The countermeasure mitigates the attacks with the highest noise-tolerance while having very little overhead. The results on a physical device validate our simulations.",

    "abstract": "The secure management of private keys is a fundamental challenge, particularly for the general public, as losing these keys can result in irreversible asset loss. Traditional custodial approaches pose security risks, while decentralized secret sharing schemes offer a more resilient alternative by distributing trust among multiple parties. In this work, we extend an existing decentralized, verifiable, and extensible cryptographic key recovery scheme based on Shamir's secret sharing. We introduce a refresh phase that ensures proactive security, preventing long-term exposure of secret shares. Our approach explores three distinct methods for refreshing shares, analyzing and comparing their security guarantees and computational complexity. Additionally, we extend the protocol to support more complex access structures, with a particular focus on threshold access trees, enabling fine-grained control over key reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "The random probing model formalizes a leakage scenario where each wire in a circuit leaks with probability $p$. This model holds practical relevance due to its reduction to the noisy leakage model, which is widely regarded as the appropriate formalization for power and electromagnetic side-channel attacks. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present new techniques for designing efficient masking schemes that achieve tighter random probing security with lower complexity. First, we introduce the notion of \\emph{cardinal random probing composability} (Cardinal-RPC), offering a new trade-off between complexity and security for composing masking gadgets. Next, we propose a novel refresh technique based on a simple iterative process: randomly selecting and updating two shares with fresh randomness. While not perfectly secure in the standard probing model, this method achieves arbitrary cardinal-RPC security, making it a versatile tool for constructing random-probing secure circuits. Using this refresh, we develop additional basic gadgets (e.g., linear multiplication, addition, and copy) that satisfy the cardinal-RPC notion. Despite the increased complexity, the gains in security significantly outweigh the overhead, with the number of iterations offering useful flexibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo showcase our techniques, we apply them to lattice-based signatures. Specifically, we introduce a new random-probing composable gadget for sampling small noise, a key component in various post-quantum algorithms. To assess security in this context, we generalize the random probing security model to address auxiliary inputs and public outputs. We apply our findings to Raccoon, a masking-friendly signature scheme originally designed for standard probing security. We prove the secure composition of our new gadgets for key generation and signature computation, and show that our masking scheme achieves a superior security-performance tradeoff compared to previous approaches based on random probing expansion. To our knowledge, this is the first fully secure instantiation of a post-quantum algorithm in the random probing model.",

The main families of fields used in cryptography are the highly predominant cyclotomic fields (used for instance in the HAWK scheme), as well as the NTRU Prime fields, used for instance in the eponymous NTRU Prime scheme (Bernstein, Chuengsatiansup, Lange, van Vredendaal, SAC 2017).\r\n\r\nIn this work, we generalize the attack of Mureau et al. against rank-$2$ module-LIP to the family of all number fields with at least one real embedding, which contains the NTRU Prime fields. We present three variants of our attack, firstly a heuristic one that runs in quantum polynomial time. Secondly, under the extra assumption that the defining polynomial of $K$ has a $2$-transitive Galois group (which is the case for the NTRU Prime fields), we give a provable attack that runs in quantum polynomial time. And thirdly, with the same $2$-transitivity assumption we give a heuristic attack that runs in classical polynomial time. For the latter we use a generalization of the Gentry--Szydlo algorithm to any number field which might be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Garbling is a fundamental cryptographic primitive, with numerous theoretical and practical applications. Since the first construction by Yao (FOCS\u201982, \u201986), a line of work has concerned itself with reducing the communication and computational complexity of that construction. One of the most efficient garbling schemes presently is the \u2018Half Gates\u2019 scheme by Zahur, Rosulek, and Evans (Eurocrypt\u201915). Despite its widespread adoption, the provable security of this scheme has been based on assumptions whose only instantiations are in idealized models. For example, in their original paper, Zahur, Rosulek, and Evans showed that hash functions satisfying a notion called circular correlation robustness (CCR) suffice for this task, and then proved that CCR secure hash functions can be instantiated in the random permutation model. In this work, we show how to securely instantiate the Half Gates scheme in the standard model. To this end, we first show how this scheme can be securely instantiated given a (family of) weak CCR hash function, a notion that we introduce. Furthermore, we show how a weak CCR hash function can be used to securely instantiate other efficient garbling schemes, namely the ones by Rosulek and Roy (Crypto\u201921) and Heath (Eurocrypt\u201924). Thus we believe this notion to be of independent interest. Finally, we construct such weak CCR hash functions using indistinguishability obfuscation and one-way functions. The security proof of this construction constitutes our main technical contribution. While our construction is not practical, it serves as a proof of concept supporting the soundness of these garbling schemes, which we regard to be particularly important given the recent initiative by NIST to standardize garbling, and the optimizations in Half Gates being potentially adopted.",

    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows computations on encrypted data without requiring decryption, ensuring data privacy during processing.  However, FHE introduces a significant expansion of ciphertext sizes compared to plaintexts, which results in higher communication. A practical solution to mitigate this issue is  transciphering, where only the master key is homomorphically encrypted, while the actual data is encrypted using a symmetric cipher, usually a stream cipher. The server then homomorphically evaluates the stream cipher to convert the encrypted data into a homomorphically encrypted form.\r\n\r\nWe introduce Transistor, a stream cipher specifically designed for efficient homomorphic evaluation within the TFHE scheme, a widely-used FHE framework known for its fast bootstrapping and ability to handle low-precision data. Transistor operates on $\\mathbb{F}_{17}$ which is chosen to optimize TFHE performances. Its components are carefully engineered to both control noise growth and provide strong security guarantees. First, a simple TFHE-friendly implementation technique for LFSRs allows us to use such components to cheaply increase the state size. At the same time, a small Finite State Machine is the only part of the state updated non-linearly, each non-linear operation corresponding in TFHE to a rather expensive Programmable Bootstrapping. This update is done using an AES-round-like transformation. But, in contrast to other stream ciphers like SNOW or LEX, our construction comes with information-theoretic security arguments proving that an attacker cannot obtain any information about the secret key from three or fewer consecutive keystream outputs. These information-theoretic arguments are then combined with a thorough analysis of potential correlations to bound the minimal keystream length required for recovering the secret key.\r\n\r\nOur implementation of Transistor significantly outperforms the state of the art of TFHE transciphering, achieving a throughput of over 60 bits/s on a standard CPU, all while avoiding the need for an expensive initialization process.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we consider the communication complexity of MPC protocols in honest majority setting achieving malicious security in both information-theoretic setting and computational setting. On the one hand, we study the possibility of basing honest majority MPC protocols on oblivious linear evaluation (OLE)-hybrid model efficiently with information-theoretic security. More precisely, we instantiate preprocessing phase of the recent work Sharing Transformation (Goyal, Polychroniadou, and Song, CRYPTO 2022) assuming random OLE correlations. Notably, we are able to prepare packed Beaver triples with malicious security achieving amortized communication of $O(n)$ field elements plus a number of $O(n)$ OLE correlations per packed Beaver triple, which is the best known result. To further efficiently prepare random OLE correlations, we resort to IKNP-style OT extension protocols (Ishai et al., CRYPTO 2003) in random oracle model. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we derive a communication lower bound for preparing OLE correlations in the information-theoretic setting based on negative results due to Damg\u00e5rd, Larsen, and Nielsen (CRYPTO 2019).\r\n\r\nCombining our positive result with the work of Goyal, Polychroniadou, and Song (CRYPTO 2022), we derive an MPC protocol with amortized communication of $O(\\ell+\\kappa)$ elements per gate in random oracle model achieving malicious security, where $\\ell$ denotes the length of a field element and $\\kappa$ is the security parameter.",

    "abstract": "Decentralized Autonomous Organization operates without a central entity, being owned and governed collectively by its members. In this organization, decisions are carried out automatically through smart contracts for routine tasks, while members vote for unforeseen issues. Scalability in decision-making through voting on proposals is essential to accommodate a growing number of members without sacrificing security. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a scalable and secure DAO voting system that ensures security through Groth16 zk-SNARKs and exponential ElGamal encryption algorithm while achieving scalability by verifiably delegating heavy computations to untrusted entities. While offline computation on the exponential ElGamal homomorphic encryption algorithm is enabled to reduce the computational cost of the blockchain, Groth16 is allowed to maintain robust off-chain calculation without revealing any further details. Specifically, the Groth16 proof guarantees that (i) the encrypted votes accurately reflect the voter's voting power, ensuring no unauthorized weight manipulation; (ii) only valid non-negative vote values are encrypted, preventing unintended or malicious vote tampering; and (iii) the homomorphic summation is performed correctly.  The implementation shows that the proofs are verified remarkably fast, making the S2DV protocol highly suitable for scalable DAO voting, while preserving the security of the election.",

    "abstract": "We investigate two natural relaxations of quantum cryptographic assumptions. First, we examine primitives such as pseudorandom generators ($\\text{PRG}$s) and pseudorandom states ($\\text{PRS}$s), extended with quantum input sampling, which we term $\\text{PRG}^{qs}$ and $\\text{PRS}^{qs}$. In these primitives, the input is sampled via a quantum algorithm rather than uniformly at random. The second relaxation, $\\bot$-pseudodeterminism, allows the generator to output $\\bot$ on an inverse-polynomial fraction of inputs.\r\n\r\nWe demonstrate an equivalence between (bounded-query) logarithmic-sized $\\text{PRS}^{qs}$, logarithmic-sized $\\text{PRS}^{qs}$, and $\\text{PRG}^{qs}$. Notably, such an equivalence remains unknown for the uniform key sampling versions of these primitives. Furthermore, we establish that $\\text{PRG}^{qs}$ can be constructed from $\\bot$-pseudodeterministic $\\text{PRG}$s ($\\bot\\text{-PRG}$s). \r\n\r\nTo further justify our exploration, we present two separation results. First, we examine the relationship between $\\bot$-pseudodeterministic notions and their deterministic counterparts. We show that there does not exist a black-box construction of a one-way state generator $(\\text{OWSG})$ from a $\\bot\\text{-PRG}$, indicating that $\\bot$-pseudodeterministic primitives may be inherently weaker than their deterministic counterparts. Second, we explore the distinction between quantum and uniform input sampling. We prove that there does not exist a black-box construction of a $\\bot$-psuedodeterministic $\\text{OWSG}$ from a $\\text{PRF}^{qs}$, suggesting that primitives relying on quantum input sampling may be weaker than those using traditional uniform sampling. Given the broad cryptographic applicability  of $\\text{PRF}^{qs}$s and $\\bot\\text{-PRG}$s, these separation results yield numerous new insights into the hierarchy of primitives within MicroCrypt.",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of proving the validity of computation on ciphertexts of homomorphic encryption (HE) schemes, a feature that enables outsourcing of data and computation while ensuring both data privacy and integrity.\r\nWe propose a new solution that handles computations in RingLWE-based schemes, particularly the CKKS scheme for approximate arithmetic. Our approach efficiently handles ciphertext arithmetic in the polynomial ring $R_q$ without emulation overhead and manages ciphertexts maintenance operations, such as modulus switching, key switching, and rescaling, with small cost.\r\nOur main result is a succinct argument that efficiently handles arithmetic computations and range checks over the ring $R_q$. To build this argument system, we construct new polynomial interactive oracle proofs (PIOPs) and multilinear polynomial commitments supporting polynomials over $R_q$, unlike prior work which focused on finite fields. We validate the concrete complexity of our approach through implementation and experimentation. Compared to the current state-of-the-art on verifiable HE for RNS schemes, we present similar performance for small circuits while being able to efficiently scale to larger ones, which was a major challenge for previous constructions as it requires verifying procedures such as relinearization.",

    "abstract": "The wide adoption of deep neural networks (DNNs) raises the question of how can we equip them with a desired cryptographic functionality (e.g, to decrypt an encrypted input, to verify that this input is authorized, or to hide a secure watermark in the output). The problem is that cryptographic primitives are typically designed to run on digital computers that use Boolean gates to map sequences of bits to sequences of bits, whereas DNNs are a special type of analog computer that uses linear mappings and ReLUs to map vectors of real numbers to vectors of real numbers. This discrepancy between the discrete and continuous computational models raises the question of what is the best way to implement standard cryptographic primitives as DNNs, and whether DNN implementations of secure cryptosystems remain secure in the new setting, in which an attacker can ask the DNN to process a message whose \"bits\" are arbitrary real numbers. \r\nIn this paper we lay the foundations of this new theory, defining the meaning of correctness and security for implementations of cryptographic primitives as ReLU-based DNNs. We then show that the natural implementations of block ciphers as DNNs can be broken in linear time by using such nonstandard inputs. We tested our attack in the case of full round AES-128, and had $100\\%$ success rate in finding $1000$ randomly chosen keys. Finally, we develop a new method for implementing any desired cryptographic functionality as a standard ReLU-based DNN in a provably secure and correct way. Our protective technique has very low overhead (a constant number of additional layers and a linear number of additional neurons), and is completely practical.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade and a half, cryptanalytic techniques for Salsa20 have been increasingly refined, largely following the overarching concept of Probabilistically Neutral Bits (PNBs) by Aumasson et al. (FSE 2008). In this paper, we present a novel criterion for choosing key-$\\mathcal{IV}$ pairs using certain 2-round criteria and connect that with clever tweaks of existing techniques related to Probabilistically Independent $\\mathcal{IV}$ bits (earlier used for ARX ciphers, but not for Salsa20) and well-studied PNBs. Through a detailed examination of the matrix after initial rounds of Salsa20, we introduce the first-ever cryptanalysis of Salsa20 exceeding $8$ rounds. Specifically, Salsa20/$8.5$, consisting of $256$ secret key bits, can be cryptanalyzed with a time complexity of $2^{245.84}$ and data amounting to $2^{99.47}$. Further, the sharpness of our attack can be highlighted by showing that Salsa20/$8$ can be broken with time $2^{186.01}$ and data $2^{99.73}$, which is a significant improvement over the best-known result of Coutinho et al. (Journal of Cryptology, 2023, time $2^{217.14}$ and data $2^{113.14}$). Here, the refinements related to backward biases for PNBs are also instrumental in achieving the improvements. We also provide certain instances of how these ideas improve the cryptanalysis on $128$-bit versions. In the process, a few critical points are raised on some existing state-of-the-art works in this direction, and in those cases, their estimates of time and data are revisited to note the correct complexities, revising the incorrect numbers.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic Decentralized Functional Encryption (DDFE) is a generalization of Functional Encryption which allows multiple users to join the system dynamically without interaction and without relying on a trusted third party.  Users can independently encrypt their inputs for a joint evaluation under functions embedded in functional decryption keys; and they keep control on these functions as they all have to contribute to the generation of the functional keys.\r\n \r\nIn this work, we present new generic compilers which, when instantiated with existing schemes from the literature, improve over the state-of-the-art in terms of security, computational assumptions and functionality. Specifically, we obtain the first adaptively secure DDFE schemes for inner products in both the standard and the stronger function-hiding setting which guarantees privacy not only for messages but also for the evaluated functions. Furthermore, we present the first DDFE for inner products whose security can be proven under the LWE assumption in the standard model. Finally, we give the first construction of a DDFE for the attribute-weighted sums functionality with attribute-based access control (with some limitations). All prior constructions guarantee only selective security, rely on group-based assumptions on pairings, and cannot provide access control.",

    "abstract": "Komargodski et. al. defined evolving secret-sharing schemes with an unbounded number of parties. In this model, parties arrive one after the other and the number of parties that will arrive is not known.\r\nAnother cryptographic primitive related to secret-sharing is conditional disclosure of secrets protocols (CDS) that defined by Gertner et. al. \r\nA CDS protocol for a Boolean function $f$ involves $k$ servers and a referee. Each server holds a common secret $s$, a common random string $r$, and a private input $x_i$; using these $r$, each server locally computes one message and sends it to the referee. The referee, knowing the inputs $x_1, \\cdots, x_k$ and the messages, should be able to compute $s$ if $f(x_1, \\cdots, x_k) = 1$. Otherwise, the referee should not learn information about the secret. In a sense, this is a non-monotone version of secret sharing schemes. \r\n\r\nPeter (ISC 23'), defines evolving CDS, implementing in particular evolving predicate $f:\\{0,1\\}^*\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\}$ (he handles somewhat more general predicates for larger input domains, but generalizing to other input domains is not hard, and we focus on boolean predicates). In this setting, the number of parties is unbounded, where the parties arrive in sequential order. Each party, when arrives, sends one random message to a referee, that depending on its input, the secret, and a common randomness. He also devise evolving CDS protocols for a general evolving predicate via a black-box reduction to evolving secret-sharing scheme for a related access structure.\r\nHe analyzes this construction for general access structures, as well as other classes of functions, which yields message complexity $O(2^t)$ for the worst predicates.\r\n\r\nIn this work we provide new upper and lower bounds for evolving CDS.\r\nObserving that CDS has the potential for improved efficiency, as it is not restricted to monotone operations, we devise a new evolving general CDS construction.\r\nIn particular, our construction relies on representing the evolving predicate via an infinite branching program - LINBP, generalizing the monotone infinite branching program based construction of Alon et. al of evolving secret sharing schemes.\r\nWe obtain nontrivial ($2^{ct-o(t)}$ for $c<1$) message complexity for branching programs of larger width than Alon et al's construction (even when restricting attention to monotone predicates), as well as Peter's construction for certain (but not all) $f$'s.\r\n\r\nIndeed, we prove that our construction, as well as Peter's article (ISC 23\u2019) is tight for a certain evolving predicate -- as for evolving secret-sharing, (so called strong) evolving CDS also requires share complexity of $2^{t-o(t)}$. This is unlike the state of affairs for the finite setting, where the best known CDS constructions are much more efficient than the best known secret sharing schemes (for the hardest monotone functions).\r\nThe latter bound is proved based on an adaptation of Mazor's lower bound (in turns based on Csirmaz's lower bounding technique) to the CDS setting. It relies on a reduction from secret sharing for a certain class of infinite access structures -- the so called partite access structures to evolving CDS for a related (not necessarily monotone) function. Then, a partite evolving access structure is crafted using the Csirmaz-type argument.",

    "abstract": "Ever since the introduction of encryption, society has been divided over whether the government (or law enforcement agencies) should have the capability to decrypt private messages (with or without a war- rant) of its citizens. From a technical viewpoint, the folklore belief is that semantic security always enables some form of steganography. Thus, adding backdoors to semantically secure schemes is pointless: it only weakens the security of the \u201cgood guys\u201d, while \u201cbad guys\u201d can easily circumvent censorship, even if forced to hand over their decryption keys. \r\n\r\nIn this paper we put a dent in this folklore. We formalize three worlds: Dictatoria (\u201cdictator wins\u201d: no convenient steganography, no user co- operation needed), Warrantland (\u201cchecks-and-balances\u201d: no convenient steganography, but need user\u2019s cooperation) and Privatopia (\u201cprivacy wins\u201d: built-in, high-rate steganography, even if giving away the decryption key). We give strong evidence that all these worlds are possible, thus reopening the encryption debate on a technical level. \r\n\r\nOur main novelty is the definition and design of special encryption schemes we call anamorphic-resistant (AR). In contrast to so called \u201canamorphic schemes\u201d, \u2014 which were studied in the literature and form the basis of Privatopia, \u2014 any attempt to steganographically communicate over an AR-encryption scheme will be either impossible or hugely slow (depending on the definitional details).",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces Neo, a new lattice-based folding scheme for CCS, an NP-complete relation that generalizes R1CS, Plonkish, and AIR. Neo's folding scheme can be viewed as adapting the folding scheme in HyperNova (CRYPTO'24), which assumes elliptic-curve based linearly homomorphic commitments, to the lattice setting. Unlike HyperNova, Neo can use \u201csmall\u201d prime fields (e.g., over the Goldilocks prime). Additionally, Neo provides plausible post-quantum security.\r\n\r\nPrior to Neo, folding schemes in the lattice setting, notably LatticeFold (ePrint 2024/257), worked with constraint systems defined over a cyclotomic polynomial ring. This structure allows packing a fixed batch of constraint systems over a small prime field into a single constraint system over a polynomial ring. However, it introduces significant overheads, both for committing to witnesses (e.g., the commitment scheme cannot take advantage of bit-width of values), and within the folding protocol itself (e.g., the sum-check protocol is run over cyclotomic polynomial rings). Additionally, the required ring structure places restrictions on the choice of primes (e.g., LatticeFold is not compatible with the Goldilocks field). \r\n\r\nNeo addresses these problems, by drawing inspiration from both HyperNova and LatticeFold. A key contribution is a folding-friendly instantiation of Ajtai's commitments, with \"pay-per-bit\" commitment costs i.e., the commitment costs scale with the bit-width of the scalars (e.g., committing to a vector of bits is $32\\times$ cheaper than committing to a vector of $32$-bit values). This scheme commits to vectors over a small prime field. It does so by transforming the provided vector into a matrix and committing to that matrix. We prove that this commitment scheme provides the desired linear homomorphism for building a folding scheme. Additionally, like HyperNova, Neo runs a single invocation of the sum-check protocol, where in HyperNova it is over the scalar field of an elliptic curve and in Neo it is over an extension of a small prime field.",

    "abstract": "Syndrome decoding (SD), and equivalently Learning Parity with Noise (LPN), is a fundamental problem in cryptography, which states that for a field $\\mathbb{F}$, some compressing public matrix $\\mathbf{G} \\in \\mathbb{F}^{k\\times n}$, and a secret sparse vector $\\mathbf{e} \\in\\mathbb{F}^{n}$ sampled from some noise distribution, $\\mathbf{G}\\mathbf{e}$ is indistinguishable from uniform. Recently, the SD has gained significant interest due to its use in pseudorandom correlation generators (PCGs).\r\n\r\nIn pursuit of better efficiency, we propose a new assumption called Stationary Syndrome Decoding (SSD). In SSD, we consider $q$ correlated noise vectors $\\mathbf{e}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{e}_{q}\\in \\mathbb{F}^n$ and associated instances $\\mathbf{G}_{1}\\mathbf{e}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{G}_{q}\\mathbf{e}_{q}$ where the noise vectors are restricted to having non-zeros in the same small subset of $t$ positions $L\\subset [n]$. That is, for all $i\\in L$, $\\mathbf{e}_{j,i}$ is uniformly random, while for all other $i$, $\\mathbf{e}_{j,i} = 0$.\r\n\r\nAlthough naively reusing the noise vector renders SD and LPN insecure via simple Gaussian elimination, we observe known attacks do not extend to our correlated noise. We show SSD is unconditionally secure against so-called linear attacks, e.g., advanced information set decoding and representation techniques (Esser and Santini, Crypto 2024). We further adapt the state-of-the-art nonlinear attack (Briaud and Oygarden, Eurocrypt 2023) to SSD and demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally resistance to the attack. \r\n\r\nWe apply SSD to PCGs to amortize the cost of noise generation protocol. For OT and VOLE generation, each instance requires $O(t)$ communication instead of $O(t\\log n)$. For suggested parameters, we observe a $1.5\\times$ improvement in the running time or between 6 and $18\\times$ reduction in communication. For Beaver triple generation using Ring LPN, our techniques have the potential for substantial amortization due to the high concrete overhead of the Ring LPN noise generation.",

    "abstract": "Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zkSNARKs) lead to proofs that can be succinctly verified but require huge computational resources to generate. Prior systems outsource proof generation either through public delegation, which reveals the witness to the third party, or, more preferably, private delegation that keeps the witness hidden using multiparty computation (MPC). However, current private delegation schemes struggle with scalability and efficiency due to MPC inefficiencies, poor resource utilization, and suboptimal design of zkSNARK protocols.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce DFS, a new zkSNARK that is delegation-friendly for both public and private scenarios. Prior work focused on optimizing the MPC protocols for existing zkSNARKs, while DFS uses co-design between MPC and zkSNARK so that the protocol is efficient for both distributed computing and MPC. In particular, DFS achieves linear prover time and logarithmic verification cost in the non-delegated setting. For private delegation, DFS introduces a scheme with zero communication overhead in MPC and achieves malicious security for free, which results in logarithmic overall communication; while prior work required linear communication. Our evaluation shows that DFS is as efficient as state-of-the-art zkSNARKs in public delegation; when used for private delegation, it scales better than previous work.  In particular, for $2^{24}$ constraints, the total communication of DFS is less than $500$KB, while prior work incurs $300$GB, which is linear to the circuit size. Additionally, we identify and address a security flaw in prior work, EOS (USENIX'23).",

    "abstract": "Threshold signatures have become a critical tool in cryptocurrency systems, offering enhanced security by distributing the signing process among multiple signers. In this work, we distribute this process between a client and a permissionless decentralized blockchain, and present novel protocols for ECDSA and EdDSA/Schnorr signatures in this setting. Typical threshold access architectures used by trusted custodians suffer from the honeypot problem, wherein the more assets the custodian holds, the greater the incentive of compromising it.\r\n\r\nImplementing threshold signatures over permissionless blockchains poses a few challenges.\r\nFirst, existing networks typically work over an asynchronous reliable broadcast communication channel. Accordingly, our protocol is implemented over such a channel. As a result, it also benefits from identifiable abort, public verifiability, and guaranteed output delivery, and the client benefits from censorship resistance of blockchain systems.\r\nSecond, upon signing each block, the participating quorum may dynamically change and is post-determined.\r\nTherefore, we design a fluid protocol, that supports a post-determined dynamic quorum in each communication round, thereby complying with existing broadcast channel implementations. Third, in permissionless networks, parties may join, leave, and change their stake. Therefore, we offer protocols for network reconfiguration, with complexity independent of the number of clients in the system, and our protocol efficiently supports a weighted threshold access structure for the network. Specifically, the complexity of distributed key generation and presign only depends on the number of parties and not on the overall weight, and the amortized cost of sign only depends on the individual weight.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, our protocol introduces key improvements, including the removal of zero-knowledge proofs towards the client, and presigns with a non-interactive client. For Schnorr, the presigns are client-independent, and can be collected by the blockchain in a common pool, available for all clients in the system. These optimizations reduce communication overhead and improve the system's ability to handle traffic spikes during high-demand periods.\r\n\r\nOur protocol is UC-secure, and is therefore natively designed for multiple clients to use the system in parallel. Notably, we propose a novel assumption, Slightly-Enhanced ECDSA Unforgeability, offering concrete security for 256-bit elliptic curves for threshold ECDSA with support for parallel execution of presigns.\r\n\r\nIn addition to securing cryptocurrency wallets, we demonstrate how our protocol enables various cross-chain applications, such as decentralized bridges, future transactions, andwallet transfer. Our system is designed for interoperability across multiple blockchains, enhancing security, scalability, and flexibility for decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology\r\nrecently standardized the first set of post-quantum cryptography algo-\r\nrithms. These algorithms address the quantum threat, but also present\r\nnew challenges due to their larger memory and computational footprint.\r\nThree of the four standardized algorithms are lattice based, offering good\r\nperformance but posing challenges due to complex implementation and\r\nintricate security assumptions. A more conservative choice for quantum-\r\nsafe authentication are hash-based signature systems. However, due to\r\nlarge signature sizes and low signing speeds, hash-based systems have\r\nonly found use in niche applications.

We demonstrate\r\nthis in the context of user authentication using hardware security keys\r\nwithin FIDO. Our SPHINCS+-based implementation can even outper-\r\nform lattice-based solutions while remaining highly portable.

    "abstract": "The Fujisaki-Okamoto transform (FO) is the go-to method for achieving chosen-ciphertext (CCA) security for post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs). An important step in FO is augmenting the decryption/ decapsulation algorithm with a re-encryption step -- the decrypted message is re-encrypted to check whether the correct encryption randomness was used. While solving a security problem (ciphertext-malleability), re-encryption has turned out to introduce side-channel vulnerabilities and is computationally expensive, which has lead designers to searching for alternatives. In this work, we perform a comprehensive study of such alternatives. We formalize a central security property, computational rigidity, and show that it is sufficient  for obtaining CCA security. We present a framework for analyzing algorithms that can replace re-encryption and still achieve rigidity, and analyze existing proposals in this framework.\r\nAlong the way, we pick up a novel QROM security statement for explicitly rejecting KEMs based on  deterministic PKE schemes, something that so far only was possible when requiring a hard-to-ensure quantum property for the base PKE scheme.",

    "abstract": "Although privately programmable pseudorandom functions (PPPRFs) are known to have numerous applications, so far, the only known constructions rely on Learning with Error (LWE) or indistinguishability obfuscation.  We show how to construct a relaxed PPPRF with only one-way functions (OWF). The resulting PPPRF satisfies $1/\\textsf{poly}$ security and works for polynomially sized input domains. Using the resulting PPPRF, we can get new results for preprocessing Private Information Retrieval (PIR) that improve the state of the art. Specifically, we show that relying only on OWF, we can get a 2-server preprocessing PIR with polylogarithmic bandwidth while consuming $\\widetilde{O}_\\lambda(N^{\\frac12 + \\epsilon})$ client space and $N^{1+\\epsilon}$ server space for an arbitrarily small constant $\\epsilon \\in (0, 1)$. In the 1-server setting, we get a preprocessing PIR from OWF that achieves polylogarithmic online bandwidth and $\\widetilde{O}_\\lambda(N^{\\frac12 + \\epsilon})$ offline bandwidth, while preserving the same client and server space as before. Our result, in combination with the lower bound of Ishai, Shi, and Wichs (CRYPTO'24), establishes a tight understanding of the bandwidth and client space tradeoff for 1-server preprocessing PIR from Minicrypt assumptions. Interestingly, we are also the first to show non-trivial ways to combine client-side and server-side preprocessing to get improved results for PIR.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines whether a revocation function can be added to a protocol, protocol FSU, that has been adopted as an international standard, ISO/IEC11770-3. Protocol FSU is an IB-AKE protocol based on a mathematical problem, an asymmetric gap bilinear Diffie--Hellman (GBDH) problem.\r\nTo make protocol FSU revocable, a generic technique is applied, which converts an identity-based encryption scheme to a revocable identity-based encryption scheme by introducing a symmetric-key encryption scheme. In addition, to make the converted RIB-AKE protocol efficient, we reduce ephemeral information exchanged in the protocol, and introduce an additional parameter to the master public-key where the secret information of the additional parameter is not needed to include in the master secret-key.\r\nWe discuss the security of the resultant protocol, and prove that it is rid-eCK secure under the asymmetric GBDH assumption.",

    "abstract": "Verifiable Computation over encrypted data (VC) faces a critical dilemma between two competing paradigms: SNARK-FHE (applying SNARKs to prove FHE operations) and FHE-SNARK (homomorphically evaluating SNARK proofs). There are two interesting questions remain open to solving such a dilemma: 1) Are they identical in terms of security? 2) How practically efficient can we get? This work answers these questions through the following results: \r\n\r\n1) We establish a formal security analysis between VC and secure two-party computation (2PC). We investigate VC with server inputs and show the following: a) VC with server input has an exact 1-bit security loss compared to 2PC; b)  SNARK-FHE aligns with 2PC while  FHE-SNARK  naturally falls in the VC category; c) Existing  FHE-SNARK  works is vulnerable in the VC with server input setting, for which we formalize a input-dependent attack.\r\n\r\n2) We design an FHE-friendly SNARK that is: a) 3\u00d7 lower multiplicative depth than FRI-based SNARKs;  b) Compatible with FHE SIMD operations. Based on this novel SNARK, we construct an FHE-SNARK scheme that has: a) Stronger security: resistant against input-dependent attack; b) 8\u00d7 speedup: 3.6-hour proof generation for $2^{20}$-gate circuits  on a single core CPU (vs. 29 hours in the state-of-the-art); c) Practical verification: 65.3 MB proofs with 2.7 seconds verification (single core).",

    "abstract": "The celebrated Algorand protocol solves validated byzantine agreement in a scalable manner in the synchronous setting. In this paper, we study the feasibility of similar solutions in the asynchronous setting. Our main result is an asynchronous validated byzantine agreement protocol that we call Asynchronous Algorand. As with Algorand, it terminates in an expected constant number of rounds, and honest parties send an expected $O(n ~\\mathsf{polylog}~n)$ bits, where $n$ is the number of parties. The protocol is resilient to a fully-asynchronous weakly-adaptive adversary that can corrupt a near-optimal number of parties ($<(1/3-\\epsilon) n$) and requires just a VRF setup and secure erasures.\r\n\r\nA key innovation in Asynchronous Algorand is a rather simple but surprisingly effective method to do \\textit{committee-based role assignment} for asynchronous verifiable secret sharing in the YOSO (You Only Speak Once) model. This method achieves near-optimal resilience and near-linear communication complexity while relying solely on a verifiable random function (VRF) setup and secure erasures.",

    "abstract": "The concept of Anamorphic Encryption (Persiano, Phan and Yung, Eurocrypt '22), aims to enable private communication in settings where the usage of encryption is heavily controlled by a central authority (henceforth called the dictator) who can obtain users' secret keys.\r\nSince then, various works have improved our understanding of AE in several aspects, including its limitations. To this regard, two recent works constructed various Anamorphic-Resistant Encryption (ARE) schemes, i.e., schemes admitting at most $O(\\log(\\lambda))$ bits of covert communication.\r\nHowever, those results are still unsatisfactory, each coming with at least one of the following issues: (1) use of cryptographic heavy hammers such as indistinguishability obfuscation (iO); (2) abuse of the original definition to define overly powerful dictators; (3) reliance on the Random Oracle Model (ROM). In particular, proofs in the ROM are controversial as they fail to account for anamorphic schemes making non-black-box usage of the hash function used to instantiate the Random Oracle. \r\nIn this work, we overcome all of these limitations.\r\nFirst, we describe an anamorphic-resistant encryption (ARE) scheme approaching practicality by relying only on public-key encryption and Extremely Lossy Functions (ELFs), both known from the (exponential) DDH assumption. Moreover, further assuming Unique NIZKs (known from iO), we provide another construction, which we later use to realize the first $\\textit{definitive}$ ARE; that is, a $\\textit{single}$ scheme that $\\textit{simultaneously}$ achieves the strongest level of anamorphic resistance against each of the possible levels of anamorphic security.",

    "abstract": "Indistinguishability obfuscation (\\iO) is a powerful cryptographic primitive\r\nand has been quoted as the ``swiss army-knife of modern cryptography''.   Most prior works on \\iO focused on theoretical feasibility, and paid less attention to the efficiency of the constructions.   As a result, all prior constructions stopped at  achieving polynomial efficiency without worrying  about how large the polynomial is.\r\nIn fact, it has even been conjectured that  a polynomial dependence on the input length is necessary.  \r\n\r\nIn this work, we show that if the two circuits to be obfuscated enjoy a succinct propositional logic proof of equivalence, then we can  \r\ncreate obfuscated versions of  these programs that are computationally indistinguishable; and importantly, the obfuscated program's efficiency is quasi-linear in the circuit size and proof size.  We show that our quasi-linear \\iO construction also leads to new applications. Specifically, we show how to achieve quasi-linear efficiency for 1) \\iO for Turing Machines with unbounded inputs, and 2) multi-input functional encryption, also assuming succinct proofs of equivalence.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of embedded code encryption, i.e., encryption for binary software code for a secure microcontroller that is stored in an insecure external memory. As every single instruction must be decrypted before it can be executed, this scenario requires an extremely low latency decryption. We present a formal treatment of embedded code encryption security definitions, propose three constructions, namely ACE1, ACE2 and ACE3, and analyze their security. Further, we present ChiLow, a family of tweakable block ciphers and a related PRF specifically designed for embedded code encryption. At the core of ChiLow, there is ChiChi, a new family of non-linear layers of even dimension based on the well-known \u03c7 function. Our fully unrolled hardware implementation of ChiLow, using the Nangate 15nm Open Cell Library, achieves a decryption latency of less than 280 picoseconds.",

    "abstract": "Receiver anamorphic encryption (hereafter anamorphic encryption), introduced by Persiano et al. at Eurocrypt 2022, allows for a double message to be symmetrically hidden in a public-key encryption ciphertext via a pre-shared -double key-. In anamorphic encryption, confidentiality must be preserved even if the adversary (or the -dictator-) has access to all regular keys. It has been the subject of several works since its introduction that explore tweaks and extensions to the core primitive. However, this study has not been systematic, and so disparate security notions have been proposed, for which their relationships are not clear. Moreover, there are clear gaps in the literature, including in the treatment of chosen-ciphertext attacks.\r\n    \r\nIn this work, we conduct a systematic study of receiver anamorphic encryption. We unify existing security notions and propose several new ones, and prove implications and separations between them. Our main findings are as follows. First, we identify gaps in previous security notions against an anamorphic -sender-, namely an adversary who is given the double key, and propose three new security notions to bridge these gaps. We also identify several gaps in the treatment of chosen-ciphertext attacks, a setting only very recently considered in anamorphic cryptography (Jaeger and Stracovsky, Asiacrypt 2024). Moreover, observing that no previous construction achieves all desirable security properties in this setting, we propose a suitable construction that does. Finally, we propose several security notions for -asymmetric- anamorphic encryption, and explore the case here where the dictator and the anamorphic sender collude.",

    "abstract": "Non-interactive key exchange (NIKE) is a simple and elegant cryptographic primitive that allows two or more users to agree on a secret shared key without any interaction. NIKE schemes have been formalized in different scenarios (such as the public-key, or the identity-based setting), and have found many applications in cryptography.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose a NIKE variant that generalizes public-key and identity-based NIKE: a multi-authority identity-based NIKE (MA-ID-NIKE) is defined like an identity-based NIKE, only with several identity domains (i.e., several instances of an identity-based NIKE), and such that users from different identity domains can compute shared keys. This makes MA-ID-NIKE schemes more versatile than existing NIKE or identity-based NIKE schemes, for instance, in an application in which users from different (centrally managed) companies need to compute shared keys.\r\n\r\nWe show several results for MA-ID-NIKE schemes:\r\n - We show that MA-ID-NIKE schemes generically imply public-key NIKEs, identity-based NIKEs, as well as forward-secure NIKE schemes, the latter of which are notoriously hard to construct.\r\n - We propose two simple constructions of MA-ID-NIKE schemes from indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) and multilinear maps, respectively. These constructions achieve only selective security, but can be leveraged to adaptive security for small groups of users (that want to be able to agree on a joint shared key) in the random oracle model.\r\n - We give a simple and elegant construction of MA-ID-NIKEs from identity-based encryption (IBE) and universal samplers. This construction achieves adaptive security also for large groups of users based on the adaptive security of the used universal samplers. Universal samplers, in turn, are known to be achievable using iO in the random oracle model. As a nice feature, the same construction yields hierarchical MA-ID-NIKEs or public-key NIKEs when instantiated with hierarchical IBE or public-key encryption instead of IBE schemes.\r\nWhile these results are clearly only feasibility results, they do demonstrate the achievability of a concept that itself has very practical use cases.",

    "abstract": "Succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (SNARKs) are variants of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (NIZKs) in which complex statements can be proven in a compact way. SNARKs have had tremendous impact in several areas of cryptography, including verifiable computing, blockchains, and anonymous communication. A recurring concept in many applications is the concept of recursive SNARKs, in which a proof references a previous proof to show an evolved statement.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we investigate malleable SNARKs, a generalization of this concept of recursion. An adaptation of the existing concept of malleable NIZKs, malleable SNARKs allow to modify SNARK proofs to show related statements, but such that such mauled proofs are indistinguishable from \u201cproperly generated\u201d fresh proofs of the related statement. We show how to instantiate malleable SNARKs for universal languages and relations, and give a number of applications: the first post-quantum RCCA-secure rerandomizable and updatable encryption schemes, a generic construction of reverse firewalls, and an unlinkable (i.e., computation-hiding) targeted malleable homomorphic encryption scheme.\r\n\r\nTechnically, our malleable SNARK construction relies on recursive proofs, but with a twist: in order to support the strong indistinguishability properties of mauled and fresh SNARK proofs, we need to allow an unbounded recursion depth. To still allow for a reasonable notion of extractability in this setting (and in particular to guarantee that extraction eventually finishes with a \u201cproper\u201d witness that does not refer to a previous SNARK proof), we rely on a new and generic computational primitive called adversarial one-way function (AOWF) that may be of independent interest. We give an AOWF candidate and prove it secure in the random oracle model.",

    "abstract": "A threshold verifiable random function (threshold VRF) is a VRF where the evaluation key is secret shared among $n$ parties, and a quorum of $t$ parties is needed to evaluate the VRF. Threshold VRFs are used widely in practice in applications such as randomness beacons and deterministic wallets. Despite their long history, the question of accountability for leaking key shares in a threshold VRF has not been studied. Specifically, consider a set of $f$ parties who use their key shares to create an evaluation box $E$ that lets anyone evaluate the VRF at any point in the domain of the VRF. When $f$ is less than the threshold $t$, this box $E$ must also take as input $t-f$ additional evaluation shares. Our goal is to design a threshold VRF where there is a tracing algorithm that can trace any such box $E$ to the coalition of $f$ parties that created it, using only blackbox access to $E$. The risk of tracing should deter the coalition from selling such a box. Questions in this vein were previously explored in the context of threshold decryption and secret sharing. Here we define and study traceability for a threshold VRF. \r\n\r\nOur traceable threshold VRF is built from a VRF based on Paillier encryption. The starting point for our tracing algorithm is the tracing technique of Boneh-Partap-Rotem (Crypto 2024) designed for tracing leaks in the context of secret sharing. However, there are multiple technical challenges in making this approach work, and we develop the necessary tools to overcome all these challenges. The end result is a threshold VRF with a provably secure tracing algorithm.",

    "abstract": "We propose new techniques for enhancing the efficiency of $\\Sigma$-protocols in lattice settings.\r\n  One major challenge in lattice-based $\\Sigma$-protocols is restricting the norm of the extracted witness in soundness proofs.\r\n  Most of existing solutions either repeat the protocol several times or opt for a relaxation version of the original relation.\r\n  Recently, Boneh and Chen have propose an innovative solution called $\\mathsf{LatticeFold}$,\r\n  which utilizes a sum-check protocol to enforce the norm bound on the witness.\r\n  In this paper, we elevate this idea to efficiently proving multiple polynomial relations without relaxation.\r\n  Simply incorporating the techniques from $\\mathsf{LatticeFold}$ into $\\Sigma$-protocols leads to inefficient results;\r\n  therefore, we introduce several new techniques to ensure efficiency.\r\n  First, to enable the amortization in [AC20] for multiple polynomial relations,\r\n  we propose a general linearization technique to reduce polynomial relations to homomorphic ones.\r\n  Furthermore, we generalize the folding protocol in LatticeFold, enabling us to efficiently perform folding and other complex operations multiple times without the need to repeatedly execute sum-checks. Moreover, we achieve zero-knowledge by designing hiding claims and elevating the zero-knowledge sum-check protocol [XZZ+19] on rings.\r\n  Our protocol achieves standard soundness, thereby enabling the efficient integration of the compressed $\\Sigma$-protocol theory [AC20, ACF21] in lattice settings.",

    "abstract": "The public comments received for the review process for NIST (SP) 800-38A pointed out two important issues that most companies face: (1) the limited security that AES can provide due to its 128-bit block size and (2) the problem of nonce-misuse in practice. In this paper, we provide an alternative solution to these problems by introducing two optimally secure deterministic authenticated encryption (DAE) schemes, denoted as DENC1 and DENC2 respectively. We show that our proposed constructions improve the state-of-the-art in terms of security and efficiency. Specifically, DENC1 achieves a robust security level of $O(r^2\\sigma^2\\ell/2^{2n})$, while DENC2 attains a near-optimal security level of $O(r\\sigma/2^{n})$, where $\\sigma$ is the total number of blocks, $\\ell$ is maximum number of blocks in each query, and $r$ is a user-defined parameter closely related to the rate of the construction. Our research centers on the development of two IV-based encryption schemes, referred to as IV1 and IV2, which respectively offer security levels of $O(r^2\\sigma^2\\ell/2^{2n})$ and $O(r\\sigma/2^{n})$. Notably, both of our DAE proposals are nearly rate 1/2 constructions. In terms of efficiency, our proposals compare favorably with state-of-the-art AE modes on contemporary microprocessors.",

    "abstract": "SCARF is a tweakable block cipher dedicated to cache address randomization, proposed at the USENIX Security conference.  It has a 10-bit block, 48-bit tweak, and 240-bit key.  SCARF is aggressively optimized to meet the harsh latency constraints of cache address randomization, and uses a dedicated model for its security claim.\r\nThe full version of SCARF has 8 rounds, and its designers claim security up to $2^{40}$ queries and $2^{80}$ computations.  In this work we present a distinguisher against 6-round SCARF under the collision model with time and query complexity $2^{30}$, and a key-recovery attack against the full 8-round SCARF under the encryption-decryption model with $2^{39}$ queries and time $2^{76.2}$. As part of the attack, we present a novel method to compute the minimal number of right pairs following a differential characteristic when the input pairs are restricted to a subspace of the domain of the primitive.",

    "abstract": "We introduce $\\mathsf{Zinc}$, a hash-based succinct argument for integer arithmetic. $\\mathsf{Zinc}$'s goal is to provide a practically efficient scheme that  bypasses the arithmetization overheads that many succinct arguments present. These overheads can be of orders of magnitude in many applications. By enabling proving statements over the integers, we are able to arithmetize many operations of interest with almost no overhead. This includes modular operations involving any moduli, not necessarily prime, and possibly involving multiple moduli in the same statement. In particular, $\\mathsf{Zinc}$ allows to prove statements for the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ for arbitrary $n\\geq 1$. Importantly, and departing from prior work, our schemes are purely code and hash-based, and do not require hidden order groups. In its final form, $\\mathsf{Zinc}$ operates similarly to other hash-based schemes using Brakedown as their PCS, and at the same time it benefits from the arithmetization perks brought by  working over $\\mathbb{Z}$ (and $\\mathbb{Q}$) natively. \r\n\r\nAt its core, $\\mathsf{Zinc}$ is a succinct argument for proving relations over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, even though when applied to integer statements, an honest prover and verifier will only operate with small integers. $\\mathsf{Zinc}$ consists of two main components: 1) $\\mathsf{Zinc}$-$\\mathsf{PIOP}$, a framework for proving algebraic statements over the rationals by reducing modulo a randomly chosen prime $q$, followed by running a suitable PIOP over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ (this is similar to the approach taken in prior works, with the difference that we use localizations of $\\mathbb{Q}$ to enable prime modular projection); and 2) $\\mathsf{Zip}$, a Brakedown-type polynomial commitment scheme built from an IOP of proximity to the integers, a novel primitive that we introduce. The latter primitive guarantees that a prover is using a polynomial with coefficients close to being integral. With these two primitives in place, one can use a lookup argument over the rationals to ensure that the witness contains only integer elements.",

    "abstract": "We present PIR protocols for offline/online two-server setting where a client $C$ wants to privately retrieve a batch of entries from database of size $N$ by interacting with a servers $S_1$. The client has interacted with a server $S_2$ ahead of time, not colluding with $S_1$. We present simple protocols based on one-way functions that substantially improve on the query complexity or runtime over existing works. Concrete instantiations of our general paradigm lead to batch PIR protocols with the following parameters:\r\n    - A protocol for batches of $\\sqrt{N}$, where $C,S_1$, and $S_2$ each spend a total of $\\tilde{O}(N)$ work and exchange $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{N})$ bits of communication. This yields an amortized complexity of $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{N})$ work and $\\tilde{O}(1)$ communication per query in the batch.\r\n   - A more balanced protocol for batches of size $N^{1/3}$ in which $C$ spends a total of $\\tilde{O}(N^{2/3})$ work, $S_1$ and $S_2$ spend $\\tilde{O}(N)$ work, and the total communication is of size $\\tilde{O}(N^{2/3})$.\r\n  Our protocols have immediate applications such as Private Set Intersection (PSI) in the two-server setting with preprocessing and unbalanced set sizes.",

    "abstract": "A secret sharing scheme allows a trusted dealer to divide a secret among multiple parties so that a sufficient number of them can recover the secret, while a smaller group cannot. In CRYPTO'21, Goyal, Song, and Srinivasan introduced Traceable Secret Sharing (TSS), which enhances traditional secret sharing by enabling the identification of parties involved in secret reconstruction, deterring malicious behavior like selling shares. Recently, Boneh, Partap, and Rotem (CRYPTO'24) presented two more efficient TSS schemes. However, these existing TSS schemes assume that all distributed shares are valid and shareholders act honestly during the secret reconstruction phase. In this paper, we introduce Traceable Verifiable Secret Sharing (TVSS), a concept designed to ensure both traceability and verifiability in the face of malicious actions by either the dealer or shareholders. We propose a general strategy for transforming a Shamir-based, computationally secure Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme into an efficient TVSS scheme. Building on this strategy, we construct two practical TVSS schemes in the honest-majority setting, based on  well-known VSS schemes proposed by Feldman (SFCS'87) and Pedersen (CRYPTO'91). Our proposed TVSS schemes retain public shareholder indexes, enhancing flexibility in designing accountable threshold protocols (e.g., Distributed Key Generation protocols) using TVSS. Compared to the original VSS schemes, the individual share size in the new TVSS schemes increases by only a single field element and is just two or three times the size of the main secret. \r\nMotivated by a recent study on Accountable Threshold Cryptosystems (ATCs) by Boneh, Partap, and Rotem (CRYPTO'24), and by leveraging our proposed Feldman-based TVSS scheme, we also introduce an efficient ATC based on ElGamal cryptosystem. This new ATC enables a tracer to uniquely identify the parties involved in the decryption process while introducing minimal overhead to existing actively secure (and/or robust) threshold protocols built on the ElGamal cryptosystem.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel single-trace side-channel attack on FALCON\u2014a lattice-based post-quantum digital signature protocol recently approved for standardization by NIST. We target the discrete Gaussian sampling operation within the FALCON key generation scheme and use a single power measurement trace to succeed. Notably, negating the \u2018shift right 63-bit\u2019 operation (for 64-bit values) leaks critical information about the \u2018-1\u2019 vs. \u20180\u2019 assignments to intermediate coefficients. These leaks enable full recovery of the generated secret keys. The proposed attack is simulated on the ELMO simulator running both reference and optimized software implementation from FALCON\u2019s NIST Round 3 package. Statistical analysis with 20k tests reveals a full key-recovery success rate of 100% for FALCON-512. This work highlights the vulnerability of current software solutions to single-trace attacks and underscores the urgent need to develop single-trace resilient software for embedded systems in the presilicon phase.",

    "abstract": "Recent applications and attacks have highlighted the need for authenticated encryption (AE) schemes to achieve the so-called committing security beyond privacy and authenticity. As a result, several generic solutions have been proposed to transform a non-committing AE scheme to a committing one, for both basic unique-nonce security and advanced misuse-resistant (MR) security. We observe that all existing practical generic transforms are subject to at least one of the following limitations: (i) not committing to the entire encryption context, (ii) involving non-standard primitives, (iii) not being a black-box transform, (iv) providing limited committing security. Furthermore, so far, there has been no generic transform that can directly elevate a basic AE scheme to a committing AE scheme that offers MR security. Our work fills these gaps by developing black-box generic transforms that crucially rely on hash functions, which are well standardized and widely deployed.\r\n\r\nFirst, we construct three basic transforms that combine AE with a single hash function, which we call $\\mathsf{HtAE}, \\mathsf{AEaH}$ and $\\mathsf{EtH}$. They all guarantee strong security, and $\\mathsf{EtH}$ can be applied to both AE and basic privacy-only encryption schemes. Next, for MR security, we propose two advanced hash-based transforms that we call $\\mathsf{AEtH}$ and $\\mathsf{chaSIV}$. $\\mathsf{AEtH}$ is an MRAE-preserving transform that adds committing security to an MR-secure AE scheme. $\\mathsf{chaSIV}$ is the first generic transform that can directly elevate basic AE to one with both committing and MR security; moreover, $\\mathsf{chaSIV}$ also works with arbitrary privacy-only encryption schemes. Both of them feature a simple design and ensure strong security.\r\n\r\nFor performance evaluation, we compare our transforms to similar existing ones, both in theory and through practical implementations. The results show that our $\\mathsf{AEaH}$ achieves the highest practical efficiency among basic transforms, while $\\mathsf{AEtH}$ excels in MRAE-preserving transforms. Our MRAE-lifting transform $\\mathsf{chaSIV}$ demonstrates comparable performance to MRAE-preserving ones and surpasses them for messages larger than approximately $360$ bytes; for longer messages, it even outperforms the benchmark, non-committing standardized $\\mathsf{AES}\\text{-}\\mathsf{GCM}\\text{-}\\mathsf{SIV}$.",

    "abstract": "In many areas of cybersecurity, we require access to Personally Identifiable Information (PII), such as names, postal addresses and email addresses. Unfortunately, this can lead to data breaches, especially in relation to data compliance regulations such as GDPR. An IP address is a typical identifier which is used to map a network address to a person. Thus, in applications which are privacy-aware, we may aim to hide the IP address while aiming to determine if the address comes from a blacklist. One solution to this is to use homomorphic encryption to match an encrypted version of an IP address to a blacklisted network list. This matching allows us to encrypt the IP address and match it to an encrypted version of a blacklist. In this paper, we use the OpenFHE library \\cite{OpenFHE} to convert network addresses into the BFV homomorphic encryption method. In order to assess the performance impact of BFV, it implements a matching method using the OpenFHE library and compares this against the partial homomorphic methods of Paillier, Damgard-Jurik, Okamoto-Uchiyama, Naccache-Stern and Benaloh. The main findings are that the BFV method compares favourably against the partial homomorphic methods in most cases.",

    "abstract": "Broadcast encryption allows a user to encrypt a message to $N$ recipients with a ciphertext whose size scales sublinearly with $N$. The natural security notion for broadcast encryption is adaptive security which allows an adversary to choose the set of recipients after seeing the public parameters. Achieving adaptive security in broadcast encryption is challenging, and in the plain model, the primary technique is the celebrated dual-systems approach, which can be implemented over groups with bilinear maps. Unfortunately, it has been challenging to replicate the dual-systems approach in other settings (e.g., with lattices or witness encryption). Moreover, even if we focus on pairing-based constructions, the dual-systems framework critically relies on decisional (and source-group) assumptions. We do not have constructions of adaptively-secure broadcast encryption from search (or target-group) assumptions in the plain model.\r\n\r\nGentry and Waters (EUROCRYPT 2009) described a compiler that takes any semi-statically-secure broadcast encryption scheme and transforms it into an adaptively-secure scheme in the random oracle model. While semi-static security is easier to achieve and constructions are known from witness encryption as well as search (and target-group) assumptions on pairing groups, the transformed scheme relies on random oracles. In this work, we show that using publicly-sampleable projective PRGs, we can achieve adaptive security in the plain model. We then show how to build publicly-sampleable projective PRGs from many standard number-theoretic assumptions (e.g., CDH, LWE, RSA).\r\n\r\nOur compiler yields the first adaptively-secure broadcast encryption scheme from search assumptions as well as the first such scheme from witness encryption in the plain model. We also obtain the first adaptively-secure pairing-based scheme in the plain model with $O_\\lambda(N)$-size public keys and $O_\\lambda(1)$-size ciphertexts (where $O_\\lambda(\\cdot)$ suppresses polynomial factors in the security parameter $\\lambda$). Previous adaptively-secure pairing-based schemes in the plain model with $O_\\lambda(1)$-size ciphertexts required $O_\\lambda(N^2)$-size public keys.",

    "abstract": "The study of fine-grained cryptography has proliferated in recent years due to its allure of potentially relying on weaker assumptions compared to standard cryptography. As fine-grained cryptography only requires polynomial gaps between the adversary and honest parties, it seems plausible to build primitives relying upon popular hardness assumptions about problems in $\\mathbf{P}$ such as $k$-$\\mathsf{SUM}$ or $\\mathsf{Zero}$-$k$-$\\mathsf{Clique}$. The ultimate hope is that fine-grained cryptography could still be viable even if all current cryptographic assumptions are false, such as if $\\mathbf{P} = \\mathbf{NP}$ or if we live in Pessiland where one-way functions do not exist.\r\n\r\nIn our work, we consider whether this approach is viable by studying fine-grained complexity when all standard cryptographic assumptions are false. As our main result, we show that many popular fine-grained complexity problems are easy to solve in the average-case when one-way functions do not exist. In other words, many candidate hardness assumptions for building fine-grained cryptography are no longer options in Pessiland. As an example, we prove that the average-case $k$-$\\mathsf{SUM}$ and $\\mathsf{Zero}$-$k$-$\\mathsf{Clique}$ conjectures are false for sufficiently large constant $k$ when no one-way functions exist. The average-case $\\mathsf{Zero}$-$k$-$\\mathsf{Clique}$ assumption was used to build fine-grained key-exchange by Lavigne et al. [CRYPTO'19].\r\n\r\nWe also show that barriers for reductions in fine-grained complexity may be explained by problems in cryptography. First, we show that finding faster algorithms for computing discrete logarithms is equivalent to designing average-case equivalence between $k$-$\\mathsf{SUM}$ and $k$-$\\mathsf{CYC}$ (an extension of $k$-$\\mathsf{SUM}$ to cyclic groups). In particular, finding such a reduction from $k$-$\\mathsf{CYC}$ to $k$-$\\mathsf{SUM}$ could potentially lead to breakthrough algorithms for the discrete logarithm, factoring, RSA and quadratic residuosity problems. Finally, we show that discrete logarithms with preprocessing may be reduced to the $k$-$\\mathsf{CYC}$-$\\mathsf{Index}$ problem, and we present faster algorithms for average-case $k$-$\\mathsf{SUM}$-$\\mathsf{Index}$ and $k$-$\\mathsf{CYC}$-$\\mathsf{Index}$.",

    "abstract": "We show a black box barrier against constructing public key quantum money from obfuscation for evasive functions. As current post-quantum obfuscators based on standard assumptions are all evasive, this shows a fundamental barrier to achieving public key quantum money from standard tools. Our impossibility applies to black box schemes where (1) obfuscation queries made by the mint are classical, and (2) the verifier only makes (possibly quantum) evaluation queries, but no obfuscation queries. This class seems to capture any natural method of using obfuscation to build quantum money.",

    "abstract": "A Garbling Scheme is a fundamental cryptographic primitive, with numerous theoretical and practical applications.  Since its inception by Yao (FOCS'82, '86), optimizing the communication and computation complexities of securely garbling circuits has been an area of active research. One such optimization, and perhaps the most fundamental, is the `Free-XOR' technique (Kolesnikov and Schneider, ICALP'08) which allows XOR gates in a function garbling to not require representation, and therefore communication. \r\n\r\nSince then, several works have designed and analysed the security of schemes that adopt the Free-XOR optimisation. In particular: (1) Applebaum (JoC'16) proved that this can be securely instantiated assuming symmetric-key encryption satisfying a notion called RK-KDM security; and (2) Zahur, Rosulek and Evans (Eurocrypt'15) proposed the so-called `Half Gates' scheme, and proved that it can be instantiated assuming hash functions satisfying a notion called CCR security. Although both schemes have been proven selectively secure, prior work leaves it open to analyze whether they satisfy a stronger security notion -- adaptive security -- in the plain model.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we formally show that the selective security of these two schemes cannot be lifted to adaptive security under the same assumptions. To establish these barriers, we adopt techniques from the work of Kamath et al (Crypto'21), who proved similar negative results for Yao's garbling. We use that as a starting point and introduce new techniques tailored towards addressing Free-XOR-based schemes.",

    "abstract": "Bulletproofs, introduced by B\u00fcnz, Bootle, Boneh, Poelstra, Wuille and Maxwell (IEEE S&P, 2018), is a highly efficient non-interactive argument system that does not require a trusted setup. Recently, B\u00fcnz (PhD Thesis, 2023) extended Bulletproofs to support arguments for rank-1 constraint satisfaction (R1CS) systems, a widely-used representation for arithmetic satisfiability problems. Although the argument system constructed by B\u00fcnz preserves the attractive properties of Bulletproofs, it presents a gap between its completeness and soundness guarantees: The system is complete for a restricted set of instances, but sound only for a significantly broader set. Although argument systems for such gap relations nevertheless provide clear and concrete guarantees, the gaps they introduce may lead to various inconsistencies or undesirable gaps within proofs of security, especially when used as building blocks within larger systems.\r\n\r\nIn this work we show that the argument system presented by B\u00fcnz can be extended to bridge the gap between its completeness and soundness, and to additionally provide honest-verifier zero-knowledge. For the extended argument system, we introduce a refined R1CS relation that captures the precise set of instances for which both completeness and soundness hold without resorting to a gap formulation. The extended argument system preserves the performance guarantees of the argument system presented by B\u00fcnz, and yields a non-interactive argument system using the Fiat-Shamir transform.",

    "abstract": "As introduced by Persiano {\\it et al.} (Eurocrypt'22), anamorphic encryption (AE)  is a primitive enabling private communications against a dictator that forces users to surrender their decryption keys. In its fully asymmetric flavor (defined by Catalano {\\it et al.}, Eurocrypt'24), anamorphic channels can work as hidden public-key mechanisms in the sense that anamorphic encryptors are not necessarily able to decrypt anamorphic ciphertexts. Unfortunately, fully asymmetric AE is hard to come by and even impossible to obtain from ordinary public-key encryption via black-box constructions. So far, only three schemes are known to rely on well-established assumptions. In this paper, we exhibit  constructions from the standard LWE assumption based on  Regev's cryptosystem and its dual version. In both cases, we retain the additive homomorphism of the schemes. We additionally show that dual Regev is public-key anamorphic in the sense of Persiano {\\it et al.} (Crypto'24). In the FHE setting, we show that the dual GSW system provides fully asymmetric AE (while preserving its leveled homomorphism) when instantiated with binary/ternary secret keys. Along the way, we discuss the extent to which our schemes satisfy a generalization of Banfi {\\it et al.}'s notion of robustness (Eurocrypt'24) to the case of homomorphically evaluated ciphertexts.",

    "abstract": "The Fiat\u2013Shamir transformation is a fundamental cryptographic technique widely used to convert public-coin interactive protocols into non-interactive ones. This transformation is crucial in both theoretical and practical applications, particularly in the construction of succinct non-interactive arguments (SNARKs). While its security is well-established in the random oracle model, practical implementations replace the random oracle with a concrete hash function, where security is merely assumed to carry over.\r\n\r\nA growing body of work has given theoretical examples of protocols that remain secure under the Fiat\u2013Shamir transformation in the random oracle model but become insecure when instantiated with any white-box implementation of the hash function. Recent research has shown how these attacks can be applied to natural cryptographic schemes, including real-world systems. These attacks rely on a general diagonalization technique, where the protocol exploits its access to the white-box implementation of the hash function. These attacks cast serious doubt on the security of cryptographic systems deployed in practice today, leaving their soundness uncertain.\r\n\r\nWe propose a new Fiat\u2013Shamir transformation (XFS) that aims to defend against broad family of attacks, including the white-box attacks mentioned above. Our approach is designed to be practical, with minimal impact on the efficiency of the prover and verifier and on the proof length. At a high level, our transformation combines the standard Fiat\u2013Shamir technique with a new type of proof-of-work that we construct.\r\n\r\nWe provide strong evidence for the security of our transformation by proving its security in a relativized random oracle model. Specifically, we show that diagonalization attacks on the standard Fiat\u2013Shamir transformation can be mapped to analogous attacks within this model, meaning they do not rely on a concrete instantiation of the random oracle. In contrast, we prove unconditionally that our XFS variant of the Fiat\u2013Shamir transformation remains secure within this model. Consequently, any successful attack on XFS must deviate from known techniques and exploit aspects not captured by our model.\r\n\r\nWe hope that our transformation will help preserve the security of systems relying on the Fiat\u2013Shamir transformation.",

    "abstract": "Randomized functional encryption (rFE) generalizes functional encryption (FE) by incorporating randomized functionalities. Randomized multi-input functional encryption (rMIFE) extends rFE to accommodate multi-input randomized functionalities. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we reassess the framework of rFE/rMIFE enhancing our understanding of this primitive and laying the groundwork for more secure and flexible constructions in this field. Specifically, we make three key contributions:\r\n\r\n  - New definition: We identify critical gap in the existing indistinguishability-based (IND) security definition for rFE/rMIFE. Notably, current definition fails to adequately address security against malicious encryptors\u2014a crucial requirement for  rFE/rMIFE since their introduction. We propose a novel, robust IND security definition that not only addresses threats from malicious decryptors but also quantifies the security against malicious encryptors effectively.\r\n\r\n  - Counterexample: To illustrate the importance of this definitional gap, we provide a counterexample of an insecure rFE scheme that meets IND security under the previous definition but explicitly fails in a natural setting (and where this failure would be precluded by our enhanced definition). Our counterexample scheme is non-trivial and meticulously designed using standard cryptographic tools, namely FE for deterministic functions, pseudorandom function (PRF), public key encryption (PKE), and simulation-sound non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proof systems.\r\n\r\n  - Adaptive unbounded-message secure construction: The only viable prior construction of rMIFE by Goldwasser et al. [EUROCRYPT 2014] (which uses indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) and other standard assumptions) has significant limitations: it permits only a pre-defined number of messages per encryption slot and operates under selective-security constraints, requiring adversaries to declare challenge ciphertext queries and \"corrupted\" encryption keys in advance. We address these shortcomings by employing sub-exponentially secure iO. Technically, we build on and adapt methods developed by Goyal et al. [ASIACRYPT 2016] for deterministic MIFE.",

    "abstract": "Secret-sharing-based multi-party computation provides effective solutions for privacy-preserving machine learning. In this paper, we present novel protocols for privacy-preserving neural network training using Shamir secret sharing scheme over Galois rings. The specific Galois ring we use is \\(GR(2^k, d)\\), which contains $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$ as a subring. The algebraic structure of \\(GR(2^k, d)\\) enables us to benefit from Shamir scheme while performing modulo operations only on \\(2^k\\) instead of a prime number, making our protocols more compatible with modern computer architectures. We achieve the parallel processing of training data by embedding different training samples into the different coefficients of the polynomial representing a single Galois ring element, and we show that this embedding can be performed with no additional communication overhead compared to processing only one sample at a time. To evaluate our methods, we conduct private training of neural networks on the MNIST dataset between different numbers of participants. The experimental results indicate the advantages of our protocols compared to existing $\\mathbb{F}_p$-based implementations in this domain.",

    "abstract": "Ratcheted key exchange (RKE) is at the heart of modern secure messaging, enabling protocol participants to continuously update their secret material to protect against full state exposure through forward security (protecting past secrets and messages) and post-compromise security (recovering from compromise). However, many practical attacks only provide the adversary with partial access to a party's secret state, an attack vector studied under the umbrella of leakage resilience. Existing models of RKE provide suboptimal guarantees under partial leakage due to inherent limitations in security under full state exposure.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we initiate the study of leakage-resilient ratcheted key exchange that provides typical guarantees under full state exposure and additional guarantees under partial state exposure between ratchets of the protocol. We consider unidirectional ratcheted key exchange (URKE) where one party acts as the sender and the other as receiver. Building on the notions introduced by Balli, R\u00f6sler and Vaudenay (ASIACRYPT 2020), we formalise a key indistinguishability game under randomness manipulation and bounded leakage (KIND), which in particular enables the adversary to continually leak a bounded amount of the sender's state between honest send calls. We construct a corresponding protocol from a key-updatable key encapsulation mechanism (kuKEM) and a leakage-resilient one-time MAC. By instantiating this MAC in the random oracle model (ROM), results from Balli, R\u00f6sler and Vaudenay imply that in the ROM, kuKEM and KIND-secure URKE are equivalent, i.e., can be built from each other. To address the strong limitations that key indistinguishability imposes on the adversary, we formalise a one-wayness game that also permits leakage on the receiver. We then propose a corresponding construction from leakage-resilient kuKEM, which we introduce, and a leakage-resilient one-time MAC. We further show that leakage-resilient kuKEM and one-way-secure URKE are equivalent in the ROM, highlighting the cost that strong one-way security entails. Our work opens exciting directions for developing leakage-resilient messaging protocols.",

    "abstract": "Oblivious pseudorandom functions (OPRFs) are an important primitive in privacy-preserving cryptographic protocols. The growing interest in OPRFs, both in theory and practice, has led to the development of numerous constructions and variations. However, most of these constructions rely on classical assumptions. Potential future quantum attacks may limit the practicality of those OPRFs for real-world applications. \r\n\r\nTo close this gap, we introduce Leap, a novel OPRF based on heuristic lattice assumptions. Fundamentally, Leap builds upon the Spring [BBL+15] pseudorandom function (PRF), which relies on the learning with rounding assumption, and integrates techniques from multi-party computation, specifically Oblivious Transfer (OT) and Oblivious Linear Evaluation (OLE). With this combination of oblivious protocols, we construct an OPRF that evaluates in less than a millisecond on a modern computer.\r\n\r\nEfficiency-wise, our prototype implementation achieves computation times of just 11 microseconds for the client and 750 microseconds for the server, excluding some base OT preprocessing overhead. Moreover, Leap requires an online communication cost of 23 kB per evaluation, where the client only has to send around 380 bytes online. To demonstrate the practical applicability of Leap, we present an efficient private set intersection (PSI) protocol built on top of Leap. This application highlights the potential for the integration of Leap into various privacy-preserving applications: We can compute an unbalanced set intersection with set sizes of 2^24 and 2^15 in under a minute of online time and just over two minutes overall.",

    "abstract": "In Crypto'19, Goyal, Jain, and Sahai (GJS) introduced the elegant notion of *secret-sharing of an NP statement* (NPSS). Roughly speaking, a $t$-out-of-$n$ secret sharing of an NP statement is a reduction that maps an instance-witness pair to $n$ instance-witness pairs such that any subset of $(t-1)$ reveals no information about the original witness, while any subset of $t$ allows full recovery of the original witness. Although the notion was formulated for general $t \\leq n$, the only existing construction (due to GJS) applies solely to the case where $t = n$ and provides only computational privacy. In this paper, we further explore NPSS and present the following contributions.  \r\n\r\n1. **Definition.** We introduce a refined definition of information-theoretically secure NPSS. This notion can be seen as a cryptographic variant of standard NP-reductions and can be compiled into the GJS definition using any one-way function.\r\n\r\n2. **Construction.** We construct information-theoretic $t$-out-of-$n$ NPSS for any values of $t\\leq n$ with complexity polynomial in $n$. Along the way, we present a new notion of secure multiparty computation that may be of independent interest.\r\n\r\n3. **Applications.** Our NPSS framework enables the *non-interactive combination* of $n$ instances of zero-knowledge proofs, where only $t_s$ of them are sound and only $t_z$ are zero-knowledge, provided that $t_s + t_z > n$. Our combiner preserves various desirable properties, such as the succinctness of the proof. Building on this, we establish the following results under the minimal assumption of one-way functions: \r\n(i) *Standard NIZK implies NIZK in the Multi-String Model* (Groth and Ostrovsky, J. Cryptology, 2014), where security holds as long as a majority of the $n$ common reference strings were honestly generated. Previously, such a transformation was only known in the common random string model, where the reference string is uniformly distributed.\r\n(ii) A *Designated-Prover NIZK in the Multi-String Model*, achieving a strong form of two-round Multi-Verifier Zero-Knowledge in the honest-majority setting.\r\n(iii) A *three-round secure multiparty computation protocol* for general functions in the honest-majority setting. The round complexity of this protocol is optimal, resolving a line of research that previously relied on stronger assumptions (Aharonov et al., Eurocrypt'12; Gordon et al., Crypto'15; Ananth et al., Crypto'18; Badrinarayanan et al., Asiacrypt'20; Applebaum et al., TCC'22).",

    "abstract": "Multi-signatures allow a set of parties to produce a single signature for a common message by combining their individual signatures. The result can be verified using the aggregated public key that represents the group of signers. Very recent work by Lehmann and \u00d6zbay (PKC '24) studied the use of multi-signatures for ad-hoc privacy-preserving group signing, formalizing the notion of multi-signatures with probabilistic yet verifiable key aggregation. Moreover, they proposed new BLS-type multi-signatures, allowing users holding a long-term key pair to engage with different groups, without the aggregated key leaking anything about the corresponding group. This enables key-reuse across different groups in a privacy-preserving way. Unfortunately, their technique cannot be applied to Schnorr-type multi-signatures, preventing state-of-the-art multi-signatures to benefit from those privacy features.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we revisit the privacy framework from Lehmann and \u00d6zbay. Our first contribution is a generic lift that adds privacy to any multi-signature with deterministic key aggregation. As our second contribution, we study two concrete multi-signatures, and give dedicated transforms that take advantage of the underlying structures for improved efficiency. The first one is a slight modification of the popular MuSig2 scheme, achieving the strongest privacy property for free compared to the original scheme. The second is a variant of the lattice-based multi-signature scheme DualMS, making our construction the first post-quantum secure multi-signature for ad-hoc privacy-preserving group signing. The light overhead incurred by the modifications in our DualMS variant still allow us to benefit from the competitiveness of the original scheme.",

Crucially, the size of both messages and of the CRS is independent of the dimension of $\\mathbf{x}$.\r\n    We present a construction of OTE with optimal complexity from the standard learning with errors (LWE) problem. Then we show how this new technical tool enables a host of cryptographic primitives, all with security reducible to LWE, such as:\r\n1)Adaptively secure laconic function evaluation for depth-$D$ functions $f:\\{0, 1\\}^m\\rightarrow\\{0, 1\\}^\\ell$ with communication $m+\\ell+D\\cdot \\mathsf{poly}(\\lambda)$.\r\n2) A trapdoor hash function for all functions.\r\n3) An (optimally) succinct homomorphic secret sharing for all functions.\r\n4) A rate-$1/2$ laconic oblivious transfer for batch messages, which is best possible.\r\nIn particular, we obtain the first laconic function evaluation scheme that is adaptively secure from the standard LWE assumption, improving upon Quach, Wee, and Wichs (FOCS 2018). As a key technical ingredient, we introduce a new notion of adaptive lattice encodings, which may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Leakage-resilient secret sharing schemes are a fundamental building block for secure computation in the presence of leakage. As a result, there is a strong interest in building secret sharing schemes that combine resilience in practical leakage scenarios with potential for efficient computation. In this work, we revisit the inner-product framework, where a secret $y$ is encoded by two vectors $(\\omega, y)$, such that their inner product is equal to $y$. So far, the most efficient inner-product masking schemes (in which $\\omega$ is public but random) are provably secure with the same security notions (e.g., in the abstract probing model) as additive, Boolean masking, yet at the cost of a slightly more expensive implementation. Hence, their advantage in terms of theoretical security guarantees remains unclear, also raising doubts about their practical relevance. We address this question by showing the leakage resilience of inner-product masking schemes, in the bounded leakage threat model. It depicts well implementation contexts where the physical noise is negligible. In this threat model, we show that if $m$ bits are leaked from the $d$ shares $y$ of the encoding over an $n$-bit field, then with probability at least $1\u22122^{-\\lambda}$ over the choice of $\\omega$, the scheme is $O(\\sqrt{ 2^{\u2212(d\u22121)\u00b7n+m+2\\lambda}})$-leakage resilient. Furthermore, this result holds without assuming independent leakage from the shares, which may be challenging to enforce in practice. We additionally show that in large Mersenne-prime fields, a wise choice of the public coefficients $\\omega$ can yield leakage resilience up to $O(n \u00b7 2^{\u2212d\u00b7n+n+d})$, in the case where one physical bit from each share is revealed to the adversary. The exponential rate of the leakage resilience we put forward significantly improves upon previous bounds in additive masking, where the past literature exhibited a constant exponential rate only.",

    "abstract": "Constant-time (CT) is a popular programming discipline to protect\r\ncryptographic libraries against micro-architectural timing attacks.\r\nOne appeal of the CT discipline lies in its conceptual simplicity: a\r\nprogram is CT iff it has no secret-dependent data-flow,\r\ncontrol-flow or variable-timing operation. Thanks to its simplicity,\r\nthe CT discipline is supported by dozens of analysis tools. However, a\r\nrecent user study demonstrates that these tools are seldom used due to\r\npoor usability and maintainability (Jancar et al. IEEE SP 2022).\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce CT-LLVM, a CT analysis tool designed for\r\nusability, maintainability and automatic large-scale analysis. \r\nConcretely, CT-LLVM is packaged as a\r\nLLVM plugin and is built as a thin layer on top of two standard LLVM\r\nanalysis: def-use and alias analysis.  Besides confirming known CT\r\nviolations, we demonstrate the usability and scalability of CT-LLVM by\r\nautomatically analyzing nine cryptographic libraries.  On\r\naverage, CT-LLVM can automatically and soundly analyze 36% of the\r\nfunctions in these libraries, proving that 61% of them are CT.  In\r\naddition, the large-scale automatic analysis also reveals new\r\nvulnerabilities in these libraries.  In the end, we demonstrate\r\nthat CT-LLVM helps systematically mitigate compiler-introduced CT\r\nviolations, which has been a long-standing issue in CT analysis.",

The decomposed LWE problem can be interpreted as postulating the circular-security of a natural lattice-based public-key encryption scheme. To gain confidence in the assumption, we show that it is implied by the hardness of the succinct LWE problem of Wee (CRYPTO'24).",

    "abstract": "Updatable public-key encryption (UPKE) allows anyone to update a public key while simultaneously producing an update token, given which the secret key holder could consistently update the secret key. Furthermore, ciphertexts encrypted under the old public key remain secure even if the updated secret key is leaked -- a property much desired in secure messaging. All existing lattice-based constructions of UPKE update keys by a noisy linear shift. As the noise accumulates, these schemes either require super-polynomial-size moduli or an a priori bounded number of updates to maintain decryption correctness.\r\n\r\nInspired by recent works on cryptography based on the lattice isomorphism problem, we propose an alternative way to update keys in lattice-based UPKE. Instead of shifting, we rotate them. As rotations do not induce norm growth, our construction supports an unbounded number of updates with a polynomial-size modulus. The security of our scheme is based on the LWE assumption over hollow matrices -- matrices which generate linear codes with non-trivial hull -- and the hardness of permutation code equivalence. Along the way, we also show that LWE over hollow matrices is as hard as LWE over uniform matrices, and that a leftover hash lemma holds for hollow matrices.",

    "abstract": "A recent work by Boneh, Partap, and Rotem [Crypto'24] introduced the concept of traceable threshold encryption, in that if $t$ or more parties collude to construct a decryption box, which performs decryptions, then at least one party's identity can be traced by making a few black-box queries to the box. This has important applications, e.g., in blockchain mempool privacy, where collusion yields high financial gain through MEVs without any consequence - the possibility of tracing discourages collusion.\r\nNevertheless, their definitions leave room for exploitation as they only achieve CPA security and do not consider inconsistency in decryption via different participating sets.\r\n\r\nThis paper proposes stronger definitions of traceable threshold encryption, which supports CCA-security and consistency. Our main approach considers identity-based variants of traceable encryption (which we also define). It converts that to a CCA-secure construction, adapting two generic transformations, first using a one-time signature and then a fingerprinting code. \r\nWe put forward two efficient instantiations of our identity-based scheme with different merits: our first construction is based on Boneh-Franklin IBE [Crypto'01] and has constant size ciphertexts but quadratic size public keys - this is proven secure based on XDH and BDDH. Our second construction is based on Boneh-Boyen IBE [Eurocrypt'04]. It supports both constant-size ciphertexts and constant-size public keys - this is proven secure based on a variant of the uber assumption over bilinear pairings. Our concrete analysis shows that the first construction's ciphertext is much (~6x) smaller than the second construction. Finally, we extend the definitions to support consistency and achieve it by adjoining an efficient, non-interactive proof of correct encryption.",

    "abstract": "The fundamental assumption in $t$-out-of-$n$ threshold encryption is that the adversary can only corrupt less than $t$ parties. Unfortunately, it may be unfounded in practical scenarios where shareholders could be incentivized to collude. Boneh, Partap, and Rotem (Crypto'24) recently addressed the setting where $t$ or more shareholders work together to decrypt illegally. Inspired by the well-established notion of traitor tracing in broadcast encryption, they added a traceability mechanism that guarantees identifying at least one of the colluders. They provide several constructions that enable traceability, all of which require a trusted dealer to distribute the secret shares. While the trusted dealer can be replaced with a DKG for conventional threshold encryption, it is unclear how to do so without compromising traceability. As thresholdizing is meant to mitigate a single point of failure, a natural question that remains is: Can we construct an efficient traceable threshold encryption scheme that does not rely on a trusted party to distribute the secret shares? \r\n    In this paper, we achieve two dealerless traceable threshold encryption constructions with different merits by extending the PLBE primitive of Boneh et al. (Eurocrypt'06) and combining it with the silent setup threshold encryption construction of Garg et al. (Crypto'24). Our first construction achieves an amortized ciphertext of size $O(1)$ (for $O(n)$ ciphertexts). Our second construction achieves constant ciphertext size even in the worst case but requires a less efficient preprocessing phase as a tradeoff. Both our constructions enjoy a constant secret key size and do not require any interaction between the parties. \r\n    An additional restriction in the constructions of Boneh et al. is that they can only guarantee to find at least one colluder, leaving techniques to identify more traitors as an open problem. In this paper, we take a first step towards solving this question by formalizing a technique and applying it to our first construction. Namely, our first construction enables tracing $t$ traitors.",

    "abstract": "A key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) allows two parties to establish a shared secret key using only public communication. For post-quantum KEMs, the most widespread approach is to design a passively secure public-key encryption (PKE) scheme and then apply the Fujisaki\u2013Okamoto (FO) transform that turns any such PKE scheme into an IND-CCA secure KEM. While the base security requirement for KEMs is typically IND-CCA security, adversaries in practice can sometimes observe and attack many public keys and/or ciphertexts, which is referred to as multi-challenge security. FO does not necessarily guarantee multi-challenge security: for example, FrodoKEM, a Round 3 alternate in NIST\u2019s post-quantum project, used FO to achieve IND-CCA security, but was subsequently shown to be vulnerable to attackers that can target multiple ciphertexts. To avert this multi-ciphertext attack, the FrodoKEM team added a salt to the encapsulation procedure and proved that this does not degrade (single-ciphertext) IND-CCA security. The formal analysis of whether this indeed averts multi-ciphertext attacks, however, was left open, which we address in this work.\r\n\r\nFirstly, we formalize FrodoKEM's approach as a new variant of the FO transform, called the salted FO transform. Secondly, we give tight reductions from multi-challenge security of the resulting KEM to multi-challenge security of the underlying public key encryption scheme, in both the random oracle model (ROM) and the quantum-accessible ROM (QROM). Together these results justify the multi-ciphertext security of the salted FrodoKEM scheme, and can also be used generically by other schemes requiring multi-ciphertext security.",

    "abstract": "Generalized secret sharing (GSS), which can offer more flexibility by accommodating diverse access structures and conditions, has been under-explored in distributed computing over the past decades. To address the gaps, we propose the publicly verifiable generalized secret sharing (PVGSS) scheme, enhancing the applicability of GSS in transparent systems. Public verifiability is a crucial property to gain trustworthiness for decentralized systems like blockchain.  We begin by introducing two GSS constructions, one based on Shamir's secret sharing and the other on the linear secret sharing scheme (LSSS). Next, we present PVGSS schemes that combine GSS with non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proofs.  Further, we construct a decentralized exchange (DEX) based on PVGSS scheme, where any users can participate in exchanges and engage in arbitrage. Specifically, users can fairly swap ERC-20 tokens with passive watchers, who earn profits by providing arbitration services. The critical property of \"fairness\" required by the DEX is ensured through a sophisticated access structure, supported by the PVGSS scheme. We provide a comprehensive evaluation on the performance of the PVGSS schemes and the monetary costs for users in the DEX. The results demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of this approach in real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Proxy re-encryption (PRE) has been regarded as an effective cryptographic primitive in data sharing systems with distributed proxies. However, no literature considers the honesty of data owners, which is critical in the age of big data. In this paper, we fill the gap by introducing a new proxy re-encryption scheme, called publicly verifiable threshold PRE (PVTPRE). Briefly speaking, we innovatively apply a slightly modified publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) scheme to distribute the re-encryption keys to multiple proxies. Consequently, we achieve publicly verifiability of data owners non-interactively. Then, the correctness of data users in decryption and public verifiability of proxies in re-encryption are guaranteed seamlessly through execution of the PVSS reconstruction algorithms. We further prove that PVTPRE satisfies IND-CPA security. Besides, we put forward a privacy-preserving data rights confirmation framework by providing clear principles for data ownership and usage, based on the PVTPRE scheme and blockchain. Blockchain plays the role of data bank and smart contract engine, providing reliable storage and verification for all framework. To our knowledge, we are the first to systematically investigate data rights confirmation considering privacy as well as public verifiability, addressing the growing need for robust mechanisms to protect data rights and ensure transparency. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments to illustrate the correctness, feasibility and effectiveness. The experimental results show that our PVTPRE outperforms other PREs in many aspects.",

    "abstract": "With the growing emphasis on data privacy, secure multi-party computation has garnered significant attention for its strong security guarantees in developing privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) schemes. However, only a few works address scenarios with a large number of participants. The state of the art by Liu et al. (LXY24, USENIX Security'24) first achieves a practical PPML protocol for up to 63 parties but is constrained to semi-honest security. Although naive extensions to the malicious setting are possible, they would introduce significant overhead.\r\nIn this paper, we propose Helix, a scalable framework for maliciously secure PPML in the honest majority setting, aiming to enhance both the scalability and practicality of maliciously secure protocols. In particular, we report a privacy leakage issue in LXY24 during prefix OR operations and introduce a round-optimized alternative based on a single-round vectorized three-layer multiplication protocol. Additionally, by exploiting reusability properties within the computation process, we propose lightweight compression protocols that substantially improve the efficiency of multiplication verification. We also develop a batch check protocol to reduce the computational complexity of revealing operations in the malicious setting. For 63-party neural network inference, compared to the semi-honest LXY24, Helix is only 1.9$\\times$ (1.1$\\times$) slower in the online phase and 1.2$\\times$ (1.1$\\times$) slower in preprocessing under LAN (WAN) in the best case.",

    "abstract": "Existing secret management techniques demand users memorize complex passwords, store convoluted recovery phrases, or place their trust in a specific service or hardware provider. We have designed a novel protocol that combines existing cryptographic techniques to eliminate these complications and reduce user complexity to recalling a short PIN. Our protocol specifically focuses on a distributed approach to secret storage that leverages Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions (OPRFs) and a Secret-Sharing Scheme (SSS) combined with self-destructing secrets to minimize the trust placed in any singular server. Additionally, our approach allows for servers distributed across organizations, eliminating the need to trust a singular service operator. We have built an open-source implementation of the client and server sides of this new protocol, the latter of which has variants for running on commodity hardware and secure hardware.",

    "abstract": "We study efficient public randomness generation protocols in the PASSO (PArties Speak Sequentially Once) model for multi-party computation (MPC). PASSO is a variation of traditional MPC where $n$ parties are executed in sequence and each party ``speaks'' only once, broadcasting and sending secret messages only to parties further down the line. Prior results in this setting include information-theoretic protocols in which the computational complexity scales exponentially with the number of corruptions $t$ (CRYPTO 2022), as well as more efficient computationally-secure protocols either assuming a trusted setup phase or DDH (FC 2024). Moreover, these works only consider security against static adversaries.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we focus on computational security against adaptive adversaries and from minimal assumptions, and improve on the works mentioned above in several ways:\r\n\r\n- Assuming the existence of non-interactive perfectly binding commitments, we design protocols with $n=3t+1$ or $n=4t$ parties that are efficient and secure whenever $t$ is small compared to the security parameter $\\lambda$ (e.g., $t$ is constant). This improves the resiliency of all previous protocols, even those requiring a trusted setup. It also shows that $n=4$ parties are necessary and sufficient for $t=1$ corruptions in the computational setting, while $n=5$ parties are required for information-theoretic security.\r\n\r\n- Under the same assumption, we design protocols with $n=4t+2$ or $n=5t+2$ parties (depending on the adversarial network model) which are efficient whenever $t=poly(\\lambda)$. This improves on the existing DDH-based protocol both in terms of resiliency and the underlying assumptions.\r\n    \r\n- We design efficient protocols with $n=5t+3$ or $n=6t+3$ parties (depending on the adversarial network model) assuming the existence of one-way functions.\r\n\r\nWe complement these results by studying lower bounds for randomness generation protocols in the computational setting.",

    "abstract": "There is a heavy preference towards instantiating BGV and BFV homomorphic encryption schemes where the cyclotomic order $m$ is a power of two, as this admits highly efficient fast Fourier transformations. Field Instruction Multiple Data (FIMD) was introduced to increase packing capacity in the case of small primes and improve amortised performance, using reverse multiplication-friendly embeddings (RMFEs) to encode more data into each SIMD slot. However, FIMD currently does not admit bootstrapping.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we achieve bootstrapping for RMFE-packed ciphertexts with low capacity loss. We first adapt the digit extraction algorithm to work over RMFE-packed ciphertexts, by applying the recode map after every evaluation of the lifting polynomial. This allows us to follow the blueprint of thin bootstrapping, performing digit extraction on a single ciphertext. To achieve the low capacity loss, we introduce correction maps to the Halevi-Shoup digit extraction algorithm, to remove all but the final recode of RMFE digit extraction.\r\n\r\nWe implement several workflows for bootstrapping RMFE-packed ciphertexts in HElib, and benchmark them against thin bootstrapping for $m=32768$. Our experiments show that the basic strategy of recoding multiple times in digit extraction yield better data packing, but result in very low remaining capacity and latencies of up to hundreds of seconds. On the other hand, using correction maps gives up to $6$ additional multiplicative depth and brings latencies often below $10$ seconds, at the cost of lower packing capacity.",

    "abstract": "Falcon is one of post-quantum signature schemes selected by NIST for standardization. With the deployment underway, its implementation security is of great importance. In this work, we focus on the side-channel security of Falcon and our contributions are threefold.\r\n\r\nFirst, by exploiting the symplecticity of NTRU and a recent decoding technique, we dramatically improve the key recovery using power leakages within Falcon Gaussian samplers. Compared to the state of the art (Zhang, Lin, Yu and Wang, EUROCRYPT 2023), the amount of traces required by our attack for a full key recovery is reduced by at least 85%.\r\n\r\nSecondly, we present a complete power analysis for two exposed power leakages within Falcon\u2019s integer Gaussian sampler. We identify new sources of these leakages, which have not been identified by previous works, and conduct detailed security evaluations within the reference implementation of Falcon on Chipwhisperer.\r\n\r\nThirdly, we propose effective and easy-to-implement countermeasures against both two leakages to protect the whole Falcon\u2019s integer Gaussian sampler. Configured with our countermeasures, we provide security evaluations on Chipwhisperer and report performance of protected implementation. Experimental results highlight that our countermeasures admit a practical trade-off between effciency and side-channel security.",

    "abstract": "Non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) arguments allow a prover to convince a verifier about the truthfulness of an NP-statement by sending just one message, without disclosing any additional information. In several practical scenarios, the Fiat-Shamir transform is used to convert an efficient constant-round public-coin honest-verifier zero-knowledge proof system into an efficient NIZK argument system. This approach is provably secure in the random oracle model, crucially requires the programmability of the random oracle and extraction works through rewinds. The works of Lindell [TCC 2015] and Ciampi et al. [TCC 2016] proposed efficient NIZK arguments with non-programmable\r\nrandom oracles along with a programmable common reference string. In this work we show an efficient NIZK argument with straight-line simulation and extraction that relies on features that alone are insufficient to construct NIZK arguments (regardless of efficiency). More specifically we consider the notion of quasi-polynomial time simulation proposed by Pass in [EUROCRYPT 2003] and combine it with simulation and extraction with non-programmable random\r\noracles thus obtaining a NIZK argument of knowledge where neither the zero-knowledge simulator, nor the argument of knowledge extractor needs to program the random oracle. Still, both the simulator and the extractor are straight-line. Our construction uses as a building block a modification of the Fischlin\u2019s transform [CRYPTO 2005] and combines it with the concept of dense puzzles introduced by Baldimtsi et al. [ASIACRYPT 2016]. We also argue that our NIZK argument system inherits the efficiency features of Fischlin\u2019s transform, which represents the main advantage of Fischlin\u2019s protocol over existing schemes.",

    "abstract": "Blind signatures allow a user to obtain a signature from an issuer in a privacy-preserving way: the issuer neither learns the signed message, nor can link the signature to its issuance. The threshold version of blind signatures further splits the secret key among n issuers, and requires the user to obtain at least t \u2264 n of signature shares in order to derive the final signature. Security should then hold as long as at most t \u2212 1 issuers are corrupt. Security for blind signatures is expressed through the notion of one-more unforgeability and demands that an adversary must not be able to produce more signatures than what is considered trivial after its interactions with the honest issuer(s). While one-more unforgeability is well understood for the single-issuer setting, the situation is much less clear in the threshold case: due to the blind issuance, counting which interactions can yield a trivial signature is a challenging task. Existing works bypass that challenge by using simplified models that do not fully capture the expectations of the threshold setting. In this work, we study the security of threshold blind signatures, and propose a framework of one-more unforgeability notions where the adversary can corrupt c < t issuers. Our model is generic enough to capture both interactive and non-interactive protocols, and it provides a set of natural properties with increasingly stronger guarantees, giving the issuers gradually more control over how their shares can be combined. As a point of comparison, we reconsider the existing threshold blind signature models and show that their security guarantees are weaker and less clearly comprehensible than they seem. We then re-assess the security of existing threshold blind signature schemes \u2013 BLS-based and Snowblind \u2013 in our framework, and show how to lift them to provide stronger security.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we consider the setting where the process of securely evaluating a multi-party functionality is divided into two phases: offline (or preprocessing) and online. The offline phase is independent of the parties\u2019 inputs, whereas the online phase does require the knowledge of the inputs. We consider the problem of minimizing the round of communication required in the online phase and propose a round preserving compiler that can turn a big class of multi-party computation (MPC) protocols into protocols in which only the last two rounds are input-dependent. Our compiler can be applied to a big class of MPC protocols, and in particular to all existing round-optimal MPC protocols. All our results assume no setup and are proven in the dishonest majority setting with black-box simulation. As part of our contribution, we propose a new definition we call Multi-Party Computation with Adaptive-Input Selection, which allows the distinguisher to craft the inputs the honest parties should use during the online phase, adaptively on the offline phase. This new definition is needed to argue that not only are the messages of the offline phase input-independent but also that security holds even in the stronger (and realistic) adversarial setting where the inputs may depend on some of the offline-phase protocol messages. We argue that this is the definition that any protocol should satisfy to be securely used while preprocessing part of the rounds. We are the first to study this definition in a setting where there is no setup, and the majority of the parties can be corrupted. Prior definitions have been presented in the Universal Composable framework, which is unfortunately not well suited for our setting (i.e., no setup and dishonest majority). As a corollary, we obtain the first four-round (which is optimal) MPC protocol, where the first two rounds can be preprocessed, and its security holds against adaptive-input selection.",

    "abstract": "Multi-signatures allow to combine several individual signatures into a compact one and verify it against a short aggregated key. Compared to threshold signatures, multi-signatures enjoy non-interactive key generation but give up on the threshold-setting. Recent works by Das et al. (CCS'23) and Garg et al. (S&P'24) show how multi-signatures can be turned into schemes that enable efficient verification when an ad hoc threshold -- determined only at verification -- is satisfied. This allows to keep the simple key generation of multi-signatures and support flexible threshold settings in the signing process later on. Both works use the same idea of combining BLS multi-signatures with inner-product proofs over committed keys. Das et al. give a somewhat generic proof from both building blocks, which we show to be flawed, whereas Garg et al. give a direct proof for the combined construction in the algebraic group model.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we identify the common blueprint used in both works and abstract the proof-based approach through the building block of a commit-and-prove system for vectors (CP). We formally define a flexible set of security properties for the CP system and show how it can be securely combined with a multi-signature to yield a signature with ad hoc thresholds. Our scheme also lifts the threshold signatures into the multiverse setting recently introduced by Baird et al. (S&P'23), which allows signers to re-use their long-term keys across several groups. The challenge in the generic construction is to express -- and realize -- the combination of homomorphic proofs and commitments (needed to realize flexible thresholds over fixed group keys) and their simulation extractability (needed in the threshold signature security proof). We finally show that a CP instantiation closely following the ideas of Das et al. can be proven secure, but requires a new flexible-base DL-assumption to do so.",

    "abstract": "Efficient anonymous credentials are typically constructed by combining proof-friendly signature schemes with compatible zero-knowledge proof systems. Inspired by pairing-based proof-friendly signatures such as Boneh- Boyen (BB) and Boneh-Boyen-Shacham (BBS), we propose a wide family of lattice-based proof-friendly signatures based on variants of the vanishing short integer solution (vSIS) assumption [Cini-Lai-Malavolta, Crypto'23]. In particular, we obtain natural lattice-based adaptions of BB and BBS which, similar to their pairing-based counterparts, admit nice algebraic properties.\r\n\r\n    [Bootle-Lyubashevsky-Nguyen-Sorniotti, Crypto'23] (BLNS) recently proposed a framework for constructing lattice-based proof-friendly signatures and anonymous credentials, based on another new lattice assumption called $\\mathsf{ISIS}_f$ parametrised by a fixed function $f$, with focus on $f$ being the binary decomposition. We introduce a generalised $\\mathsf{ISIS}_f$ framework, called $\\mathsf{GenISIS}_f$, with a keyed and probabilistic function $f$. For example, picking $f_b(\\mu) = 1/(b-\\mu)$ with key $b$ for short ring element $\\mu$ leads to algebraic and thus proof-friendly signatures. To better gauge the robustness and proof-friendliness of $\\mathsf{(Gen)}\\mathsf{ISIS}_f$, we consider what happens when the inputs to $f$ are chosen selectively (or even adaptively) by the adversary, and the behaviour under relaxed norm checks. While bit decomposition quickly becomes insecure, our proposed function families seem robust.",

    "abstract": "Pulsars exhibit signals with precise inter-arrival times that are on the order of milliseconds to seconds depending on the individual pulsar. There is subtle variation in the timing of pulsar signals, primarily due to the presence of gravitational waves, intrinsic variance in the period of the pulsar, and errors in the realization of Terrestrial Time (TT). Traditionally, these variations are dismissed as noise in high-precision timing experiments. In this paper, we show that these variations serve as a natural entropy source for the creation of Random Number Generators (RNG). We also explore the effects of using randomness extractors to increase the entropy of random bits extracted from Pulsar timing data. To evaluate the quality of the Pulsar RNG, we model its entropy as a $k$-source and use well-known cryptographic results to show its closeness to a theoretically ideal uniformly random source. To remain consistent with prior work, we also show that the Pulsar RNG passes well-known statistical tests such as the NIST test suite.",

    "abstract": "A memory checker is an algorithmic tool used to certify the integrity of a database maintained on a remote, unreliable, computationally bounded server. Concretely, it allows a user to issue instructions to the server and after every instruction, obtain either the correct value or a failure (but not an incorrect answer) with high probability. A recent result due to Boyle, Komargodski, and Vafa (BKV, STOC '24) showed a tradeoff between the size of the local storage and the number of queries the memory checker makes to the server upon every logical instruction. Specifically, they show that every non-trivial memory checker construction with inverse-polynomial soundness and local storage at most $n^{1 - \\epsilon}$ must make $\\Omega(\\log n/ \\log \\log n)$ queries, and this is tight up to constant factors given known constructions. However, an intriguing question is whether natural relaxations of the security guarantee could allow for more efficient constructions. \r\n\r\nWe consider and adapt the notion of covert security to the memory checking context, wherein the adversary can effectively cheat while taking the risk of being caught with constant probability. Notably, BKV's lower bound does not apply in this setting. \r\n\r\nWe close this gap and prove that $\\Omega(\\log n/ \\log \\log n)$ overhead is unavoidable even in the covert security setting. Our lower bound applies to any memory checker construction, including ones that use randomness and adaptivity and ones that rely on cryptographic assumptions and/or the random oracle model, as long as they satisfy a natural \"read-only reads\" property. This property requires a memory checker not to modify contents of the database or local storage in the execution of a logical read instruction.",

    "abstract": "The vanishing short integer solution (vSIS) assumption [Cini-Lai-Malavolta, Crypto'23], at its simplest form, asserts the hardness of finding a polynomial with short coefficients which vanishes at a given random point. While  vSIS has proven to be useful in applications such as succinct arguments, not much is known about its theoretical hardness. Furthermore, without the ability to generate a hard instance together with a trapdoor, the applicability of vSIS is significantly limited.\r\n\r\nWe revisit the vSIS assumption focusing on the univariate single-point constant-degree setting, which can be seen as a generalisation of the (search) NTRU problem. In such a setting, we show that the vSIS problem is as hard as finding the shortest vector in certain ideal lattices. We also show how to generate a random vSIS instance together with a trapdoor, under the (decision) NTRU assumption. Interestingly, a vSIS trapdoor allows to sample polynomials of short coefficients which evaluate to any given value at the public point. By exploiting the multiplicativity of the polynomial ring, we use vSIS trapdoors to build a new homomorphic signature scheme for low-degree polynomials.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we explore the field of lattice-based Predicate Encryption (PE), with a focus on enhancing compactness and refining functionality.\r\n\r\nFirst, we present a more compact bounded collusion predicate encryption scheme compared to previous constructions, significantly reducing both the per-unit expansion and fixed overhead, while maintaining an optimal linear blow-up proportional to $Q$.\r\n\r\nNext, we propose a Predicate Inner Product Functional Encryption (P-IPFE) scheme based on our constructed predicate encryption scheme. P-IPFE preserves the attribute-hiding property while enabling decryption to reveal only the inner product between the key and message vectors, rather than the entire message as in traditional PE. Our P-IPFE scheme also achieves bounded collusion resistance while inheriting the linear compactness optimized in the underlying PE scheme. Additionally, it supports any polynomial-sized and bounded-depth circuits, thereby extending beyond the inner-product predicate class in prior works.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, all the proposed schemes achieve selective fully attribute-hiding security in the simulation-based model, therefore, can further attain semi-adaptive security by adopting existing upgrading techniques.",

    "abstract": "There has been remarkable progress in fully homomorphic encryption, ever since Gentry's first scheme.  In contrast, fully homomorphic authentication primitives received relatively less attention, despite existence of some previous constructions. While there exist various schemes with different functionalities for fully homomorphic encryption, there are only a few options for fully homomorphic authentication. Moreover, there are even fewer options when considering two of the most important properties: adaptive security, and pre-processable verification. To our knowledge, except for some concurrent works, achieving both properties requires the use of nested construction, which involves homomorphically authenticating a homomorphic authentication tag of a message, making the scheme costly and complicated.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose a dedicated scheme for (leveled) fully homomorphic message authentication code that is adaptively secure and has pre-processable verification. Leveraging the secrecy of the primitive, we demonstrate that a slight modification of a selectively secure (leveled) fully homomorphic signature scheme yields an adaptively secure (leveled) fully homomorphic message authentication code with pre-processable verification. Additionally, we introduce a novel notion and generic transform to enhance the security of a homomorphic message authentication code, which also exploits the secrecy of the primitive.",

    "abstract": "Considering security against quantum adversaries, while it is important to consider the traditional existential unforgeability (EUF-CMA security), it is desirable to consider security against adversaries making quantum queries to the signing oracle: Plus-one security (PO security) and blind unforgeability (BU security) proposed by Boneh and Zhandry (Crypto 2013) and Alagic et al. (EUROCRYPT 2020), respectively. Hash-and-sign is one of the most common paradigms for constructing EUF-CMA-secure signature schemes in the quantum random oracle model, employing a trapdoor function and a hash function. It is known that its derandomized version is PO- and BU-secure. A variant of hash-and-sign, known as hash-and-sign with retry (HSwR), formulated by Kosuge and Xagawa (PKC 2024), is widespread since it allows for weakening the security assumptions of a trapdoor function. Unfortunately, it has not been known whether HSwR can achieve PO- and BU-secure even with derandomization.\r\nIn this paper, we apply a derandomization with bounded loops to HSwR. We demonstrate that HSwR can achieve PO and BU security through this approach. Since derandomization with bounded loops offers advantages in some implementations, our results support its wider adoption, including in NIST PQC candidates.",

    "abstract": "Traitor tracing is a traditional cryptographic primitive designed for scenarios with multiple legitimate receivers. When the plaintext - that is, the output of decryption - is leaked and more than one legitimate receiver exists, it becomes imperative to identify the source of the leakage, a need that has motivated the development of traitor tracing techniques. Recent advances in standard encryption have enabled decryption outcomes to be defined in a fine-grained manner through the introduction of Functional Encryption (FE). Constructing FE schemes is intriguing, and achieving the tracing property adds an additional layer of complexity. Traitor tracing techniques have been actively developed for more than three decades, yet they have always remained within the same framework - a single sender responsible for encrypting all the data.\r\n\r\nHowever, fine-grained decryption is particularly useful when data originates from multiple sources, allowing for joint computation on personal data. This leads to the concept of multi-client functional encryption (MCFE), where multiple concurrent senders independently encrypt their data while agreeing on the decryption of a specific function (e.g., a statistical measure) computed on the aggregated data, without revealing any additional information. In the era of cloud computing and big data, privacy-preserving joint computation is crucial, and tracing the source of any breach by dishonest participants becomes essential. Thus, in this paper we take the first step toward addressing the tracing problem in the general context of joint computation with multiple senders. Our contributions are twofold:\r\n  - $\\textbf{Conceptually:}$ We propose the first tracing model in the context of multi-sender encryption, namely $\\textit{Traceable Multi-Client Functional Encryption}$ ($\\textsf{TMCFE}$), which allows a pirate to extract secret information from both receivers and senders. Our model supports strong and naturally admissible decoders, removing artificial restrictions on the pirate decoder and thus addressing the shortcomings of existing traceable functional encryption schemes designed for the single-sender setting.\r\n  - $\\textbf{Technically:}$ To achieve our conceptual objective, we build upon the recently introduced notion of strong admissibility for MCFE. Our main technical contribution is a generic compiler that transforms a large class of MCFE schemes with weak admissibility into schemes with strong admissibility. This compiler not only helps overcome existing challenges but may also be of general interest within the functional encryption domain. Finally, we present a concrete lattice-based scheme $\\textsf{TMCFE}$ for inner-product functionalities that achieves post-quantum security under standard assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Updatable Public-Key Encryption (UPKE) augments the security of PKE with Forward Secrecy properties. While requiring more coordination between parties, UPKE enables much more efficient constructions than full-fledged Forward-Secret PKE. Alwen, Fuchsbauer and Mularczyk (AFM, Eurocrypt\u201924) presented the strongest security notion to date. It is the first to meet the needs of UPKE\u2019s most important applications: Secure Group Messaging and Continuous Group Key Agreement. The authors provide a very efficient construction meeting their notion with classic security based on the Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption in the Random Oracle Model (ROM).\r\n\r\nIn this work we present the first post-quantum secure UPKE construction meeting (a slight relaxation of) the AFM security notion. Based on the Module LWE assumption, our construction is practically efficient. Moreover, public key sizes are about $1/2$ and ciphertext sizes around $2/3$ of those of the state-of-the-art lattice-based UPKE scheme in the ROM by Abou Haidar, Passel\u00e8gue and Stehl\u00e9 \u2013 despite only being shown to satisfy a significantly weaker security notion. As the AFM proofs relies on random self-reducibility of CDH, which has no analogue for lattices, we develop a new proof technique for strong UPKE, identifying the core properties required from the underlying (lattice-based) encryption scheme.",

    "abstract": "Lattice trapdoor algorithms allow us to sample hard random lattices together with their trapdoors, given which short lattice vectors can be sampled efficiently. This enables a wide range of advanced cryptographic primitives. In this work, we ask: can we distribute lattice trapdoor algorithms non-interactively?\r\n\r\nWe study a natural approach to sharing lattice trapdoors: splitting them into partial trapdoors for different lower-rank sublattices which allow the local sampling of short sublattice vectors. Given sufficiently many short sublattice vectors, these can then be combined to yield short vectors in the original lattice. Moreover, this process can be repeated an unbounded polynomial number of times without needing a party holding a full trapdoor to intervene. We further define one-wayness and indistinguishability properties for partial trapdoors.\r\n\r\nWe establish that such objects exist that have non-trivial performance under standard assumptions. Specifically, we prove these properties for a simple construction from the \u03ba-SIS and \u03ba-LWE assumptions, which were previously shown to be implied by the plain SIS and LWE assumptions, respectively. The security proofs extend naturally to the ring or module settings under the respective analogues of these assumptions, which have been conjectured to admit similar reductions.\r\n\r\nOur partial trapdoors achieve non-trivial efficiency, with relevant parameters sublinear in the number of shareholders. Our construction is algebraic, without resorting to generic tools such as multiparty computation or fully homomorphic encryption. Consequently, a wide range of lattice-trapdoor-based primitives can be thresholdised non-interactively by simply substituting the trapdoor preimage sampling procedure with our partial analogue.",

    "abstract": "In a secret sharing scheme with polynomial sharing, the secret is an element of a finite field, and the shares are obtained by evaluating polynomials on the secret and some random field elements, i.e., for every party there is a set of polynomials that computes the share of the party. These schemes generalize the linear ones, adding more expressivity and giving room for more efficient schemes. To identify the access structures for which this efficiency gain is relevant, we need a systematic method to identify the access structure of polynomial schemes; i.e., to identify which sets can reconstruct the secret in the scheme. As a first step, we study ideal polynomial secret sharing schemes where there is a single polynomial for each party. Ideal schemes have optimal share size because the size of each share is the size of the secret.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to generalize results of linear secret sharing schemes, i.e., schemes in which the shares are computed by applying linear mappings and the linear dependency of these mappings determines their access structures. To achieve this goal, we study the connection between the algebraic dependency of the sharing polynomials and the access structure of the polynomial scheme. Our first result shows that if the degree of the sharing polynomials is not too big compared to the size of the field, then the algebraic dependence of the sharing polynomials determines the access structure of the scheme. This contributes to the characterization of ideal polynomial schemes and establishes a new connection between families of ideal schemes and algebraic matroids. \r\n\r\nConversely, we ask the question: If we associate a polynomial with each party and the dealer, can we use these polynomials to realize the access structure determined by the algebraic dependency of the polynomials? Our second result shows that these access structures admit statistical schemes with small shares. Finally, we extend this result to the general case where each party may have more than one polynomial.",

    "abstract": "Secure two-party comparison, known as Yao's millionaires' problem, has been a fundamental challenge in privacy-preserving computation. It enables two parties to compare their inputs without revealing the exact values of those inputs or relying on any trusted third party. One elegant approach to secure computation is based on homomorphic encryption. Recently, building on this approach, Carlton et al. (CT-RSA 2018) and Bourse et al. (CT-RSA 2020) presented novel solutions for the problem of secure integer comparison. These protocols have demonstrated significantly improved performance compared to the well-known and frequently used DGK protocol (ACISP 2007 and Int. J. Appl. Cryptogr. 1(4),323\u2013324, 2009). In this paper, we introduce a class of higher residuosity attacks, which can be regarded as an extension of the classical quadratic residuosity attack on the decisional Diffie-Hellman problem. We demonstrate that the small RSA subgroup decision problems, upon which both the CEK and BST protocols are based, are not difficult to solve when the prime base $p_0$ is small (e.g., \\( p_0 < 100 \\)). Under these conditions, the protocols achieve optimal overall performance. Furthermore, we offer recommendations for precluding such attacks, including one approach that does not adversely affect performance. We hope that these attacks can be applied to analyze other number-theoretic hardness assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Anamorphic encryption (AE) considers secure communication in the presence of a powerful surveillant (typically called a ''dictator'') who only allows certain cryptographic primitives and knows all the secret keys in a system. The basic idea is that there is a second (anamorphic) mode of encryption that allows to transmit an anamorphic message using a double key to a receiver that can decrypt this message using a double key. From the point of view of the dictator the encryption keys as well as the ciphertexts in the regular and anamorphic mode are indistinguishable. The most recent works in this field consider public key anamorphic encryption (PKAE), i.e., the sender of an anamorphic message requires an encryption double key (or no key at all) and the receiver requires a decryption double key. Known constructions, however, either work only for schemes that are mostly of theoretical interest or come with conceptual limitations. \r\n\r\nIn this paper we ask whether we can design such PKAE schemes without such limitations and being closer to PKE schemes used in practice. In fact, such schemes are more likely to be allowed by a cognizant dictator. Moreover, we initiate the study of identity-based anamorphic encryption (IBAE), as the IBE setting seems to be a natural choice for a dictator. For both PKAE and IBAE, we show how well-known IND-CPA and IND-CCA secure primitives can be extended by an anamorphic encryption channel. In contrast to previous work, we additionally consider CCA (rather than just CPA) security notions for the anamorphic channel and also build upon CPA (rather than just CCA) secure PKE. \r\n\r\nFinally, we ask whether it is possible to port the recent concept of anamorphic signatures, which considers constructing symmetric anamorphic channels in case only signature schemes are allowed by the dictator, to the asymmetric setting, which we denote by public-key anamorphic signatures (PKAS). Also here we consider security beyond IND-CPA for the anamorphic channel.",

    "abstract": "Oblivious Transfer (OT) is a fundamental cryptographic primitive introduced nearly four decades ago. OT allows a receiver to select and learn $t$ out of $n$ private messages held by a sender. It ensures that the sender does not learn which specific messages the receiver has chosen, while the receiver gains no information about the remaining $n \u2212 t$ messages. In this work, we introduce the notion of functional OT (FOT), for the first time. FOT adds a layer of security to the conventional OT by ensuring that the receiver only learns a function of the selected messages rather than the $t$ individual messages themselves. We propose several protocols that realize this concept. In particular, we propose concrete instantiations of FOT when the function to be executed on the selected message is mean, mode, addition, or multiplication. The schemes are efficient and unconditionally secure. We also propose a non-trivial protocol that supports arbitrary functions on the selected messages mainly using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and oblivious linear function evaluation, where the number of FHE invocations is constant $O(1)$ with respect to $n$. Our asymptotic and concrete cost analyses demonstrate the efficiency of our unconditionally secure FOT protocols. FOT can enhance the security of privacy-preserving machine learning, particularly in (i) K-Nearest Neighbors schemes and (ii) client selection in Federated Learning (FL).",

    "abstract": "Following Ibukiyama, Katsura and Oort, all  principally polarized superspecial abelian surfaces over $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_p$ can be represented by a certain type of $2 \\times 2$ matrix $g$, having entries in the quaternion algebra $B_{p,\\infty}$. We present a heuristic polynomial-time algorithm which, upon input of two such matrices $g_1, g_2$, finds a \"connecting matrix\" representing a polarized isogeny of smooth degree between the corresponding surfaces. Our algorithm should be thought of as a two-dimensional analog of the KLPT algorithm from 2014 due to Kohel, Lauter, Petit and Tignol for finding a connecting ideal of smooth norm between two given maximal orders in $B_{p,\\infty}$. \r\n \r\nThe KLPT algorithm has proven to be a versatile tool in isogeny-based cryptography, and our analog has similar applications; we discuss two of them in detail. First, we show that it yields a polynomial-time solution to a two-dimensional analog of the so-called constructive Deuring correspondence: given a matrix $g$ representing a superspecial principally polarized abelian surface, realize the latter as the Jacobian of a genus-$2$ curve (or, exceptionally, as the product of two elliptic curves if it concerns a product polarization). Second, we show that, modulo a plausible assumption, Charles-Goren-Lauter style hash functions from superspecial principally polarized abelian surfaces require a trusted set-up. Concretely, if the matrix $g$ associated with the starting surface is known then collisions can be produced in polynomial time. We deem it plausible that all currently known methods for generating a starting surface indeed reveal the corresponding matrix. As an auxiliary tool, we present an explicit table for converting $(2,2)$-isogenies into the corresponding connecting matrix, a step for which a previous method by Chu required super-polynomial (but sub-exponential) time.",

    "abstract": "We initiate the study of {\\em split prover zkSNARKs}, which allow Alice to offload part of the zkSNARK computation to her assistant, Bob. In scenarios like online transactions (e.g., zCash), a significant portion of the witness (e.g., membership proofs of input coins) is often available to the prover (Alice) before the transaction begins. This setup offers an opportunity to Alice to initiate the proof computation early, even before the entire witness is available. The remaining computation can then be delegated to Bob, who can complete it once the final witness (e.g., the transaction amount) is known.\r\n\r\nTo prevent Bob from generating proofs independently (e.g., initiating unauthorized transactions), it is essential that the data provided to him for the second phase of computation does not reveal the witness used in the first phase. Additionally, the verifier of the zkSNARK should be unable to determine whether the proof was generated solely by Alice or through this two-step process. To achieve this efficiently, we require this two-phase proof generation to only use cryptography in a black-box manner.\r\n\r\nWe propose a split prover zkSNARK based on the Groth16 zkSNARKs [Groth, EUROCRYPT 2016], meeting all these requirements. Our solution is also \\emph{asymptotically tight}, meaning it achieves the optimal second phase proof generation time for Groth16. Importantly, our split prover zkSNARK preserves the verification algorithm of the original Groth16 zkSNARK, enabling seamless integration into existing deployments of Groth16.",

Unlike prior works, our counterexample is direct, it does not use heavy cryptographic machinery (such as obfuscation or witness encryption), and it applies to all variants of the assumption. Our counterexample can be seen as a \"zeroizing\" attack against evasive LWE, calling into question the soundness of the underlying design philosophy.",

    "abstract": "Evasive LWE (Wee, Eurocrypt 2022 and Tsabary, Crypto 2022) is a recently introduced, popular lattice assumption which has been used to tackle long-standing problems in lattice based cryptography. In this work, we develop new counter-examples against Evasive LWE, in both the private and public-coin regime, propose counter-measures that define safety zones, and finally explore modifications to construct full compact FE/iO. \r\n\r\nAttacks: Our attacks are summarized as follows.\r\n   - The recent work by Hseih, Lin and Luo [HLL23] constructed the first ABE for unbounded depth circuits by relying on the (public coin) ''circular'' evasive LWE assumption, which incorporates circularity into the Evasive LWE assumption. We provide a new attack against this assumption by exhibiting a sampler such that the pre-condition is true but post-condition is false.\r\n    - We demonstrate a counter-example against public-coin evasive LWE which exploits the freedom to choose the error distributions in the pre and post conditions. Our attack crucially relies on the error in the pre-condition being larger than the error in the post-condition. \r\n    - The recent work by Agrawal, Kumari and Yamada [AKY24a] constructed the first functional encryption scheme for pseudorandom functionalities ($\\mathsf{prFE}$) and extended this to obfuscation for pseudorandom functionalities ($\\mathsf{prIO}$) [AKY24c] by relying on private-coin evasive LWE. We provide a new attack against the stated assumption. \r\n    - The recent work by Branco et al. [BDJ+24] (concurrently to [AKY24c]) provides a construction of obfuscation for pseudorandom functionalities by relying on private-coin evasive LWE.  By adapting the counter-example against [AKY24a], we provide an attack against this assumption. \r\n    - Branco et al. [BDJ+24] showed that there exist contrived, somehow ''self-referential'', classes of pseudorandom functionalities for which pseudorandom obfuscation cannot exist. We develop an analogous result to the setting of pseudorandom functional encryption.\r\n\r\nWhile Evasive LWE was developed to specifically avoid zeroizing attacks as discussed above, our attacks show that in some (contrived) settings, the adversary may nevertheless obtain terms in the zeroizing regime.\r\n\r\nCounter-measures: Guided by the learning distilled from the above attacks, we develop counter-measures to prevent against them. Our interpretation of the above attacks is that Evasive LWE, as defined, is too general -- we suggest restrictions to identify safe zones for the assumption, using which, the broken applications can be recovered.\r\n\r\nVariants to give full FE and iO: Finally, we show that certain modifications of Evasive LWE, which respect the counter-measures developed above, yield full compact FE in the standard model. We caution that the main goal of presenting these candidates is as goals for cryptanalysis to further our understanding of this regime of assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Cryptographic group actions provide simple post-quantum generalizations to many cryptographic protocols based on the discrete logarithm problem (DLP). However, many advanced group action-based protocols do not solely rely on the core group action problem (the so-called vectorization problem), but also on variants of this problem, to either improve efficiency or enable new functionalities. In particular, the\r\nsecurity of the CSI-SharK threshold signature protocol relies on the Vectorization Problem with Shifted Inputs where (in DLP formalism) the adversary not only receives $g$ and $g^x$, but also $g^{xc}$ for multiple known values of $c$. A natural open question is then whether the extra data provided to the adversary in this variant allows for more efficient attacks. In this paper, we revisit the concrete quantum security of this problem. We start from a quantum multiple hidden shift algorithm of Childs and van Dam, which to the best of our knowledge was never applied in cryptography before. We specify algorithms for its subroutines and we provide concrete complexity estimates for both these subroutines and the overall algorithm.\r\n\r\nWe then apply our analysis to the CSI-SharK protocol. In prior analyses based on Kuperberg\u2019s algorithms, group action evaluations contributed to a significant part of the overall T-gate cost. For CSI-SharK suggested parameters, our new approach requires significantly fewer calls to the group action evaluation subroutine, leading to significant T-gate complexity improvements overall. We also show that the quantum security of the protocol decreases when the number of public keys increases, and quantify this degradation.\r\n\r\nBeyond its direct application to the CSI-Shark protocol, our work more generally questions the quantum security of vectorization problem variants, and it introduces the Childs-van Dam algorithm as a new quantum cryptanalysis tool.",

    "abstract": "Ongoing efforts to transition to post-quantum secure public-\r\nkey cryptosystems have created the need for algorithms with a variety of\r\nperformance characteristics and security assumptions. Among the can-\r\ndidates in NIST\u2019s post-quantum standardisation process for additional\r\ndigital signatures is FAEST, a Vector Oblivious Linear Evaluation in-the-\r\nHead (VOLEitH)-based scheme, whose security relies on the one-wayness\r\nof the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The VOLEitH paradigm\r\nenables competitive performance and signature sizes under conservative\r\nsecurity assumptions. However, since it was introduced recently, in 2023,\r\nits resistance to physical attacks has not yet been analysed. In this\r\npaper, we present the first security analysis of VOLEitH-based signa-\r\nture schemes in the context of side-channel and fault injection attacks.\r\nWe demonstrate four practical attacks on a masked implementation of\r\nFAEST in ARM Cortex-M4 capable of recovering the full secret key with\r\nhigh probability (greater than 0.87) from a single signature. These at-\r\ntacks exploit vulnerabilities of components specific to VOLEitH schemes\r\nand FAEST, such as the all-but-one vector commitments, VOLE gener-\r\nation, and AES proof generation. Finally, we propose countermeasures\r\nto mitigate these attacks and enhance the physical security of VOLEitH-\r\nbased signature schemes.",

Using this framework, we show that SQIsign is EUF-CMA secure in the ROM, assuming the hardness of the One Endomorphism problem with hints, or the hardness of the Full Endomorphism Ring problem with hints together with a hint indistinguishability assumption; all assumptions, unlike previous ones in the literature, are non-interactive.

    "abstract": "Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman published the RSA cryptosystem in 1978, which has been widely used over the last four decades.  The security of RSA is based on the difficulty of factoring large integers $N = pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers.  The public exponent $e$ and the private exponent $d$ are related by the equation  $ed - k(p-1)(q-1) = 1$. Recently, Cotan and Te{\\c{s}}eleanu (NordSec 2023) introduced a variant of RSA,  where the public exponent $e$ and the private exponent $d$ satisfy the equation  $ed - k(p^n-1)(q^n-1) = 1$ for some positive integer $n$.  In this paper, we study the general equation  $eu - (p^n - 1)(q^n - 1)v = w$ with positive integers $u$ and $v$, and $w\\in \\mathbb{Z}$. We show that, given the public parameters $N$ and $e$, one can recover $u$ and $v$ and factor the modulus $N$ in polynomial time by combining continued fractions with Coppersmith's algorithm which relies on lattice reduction techniques, under specific conditions on $u$, $v$, and $w$. Furthermore, we show that if the private exponent $d$ in an RSA-like cryptosystem is either small or too large, then $N$ can be factored in polynomial time. This attack applies to the standard RSA cryptosystem.",

    "abstract": "Lee et al. proposed a new bootstrapping algorithm based on homomorphic automorphism, which merges the empty sets of ciphertexts by adjusting the window size. This algorithm supports arbitrary secret key distributions with no additional runtime costs while using small evaluation keys. However, our implementation reveals that once the window size exceeds a certain threshold, the time required for bootstrapping remains relatively constant. This observation prompts the question of how to further reduce the running time.\r\nTo address this challenge, we introduce a new trick called Adaptive Key Update (AKU). With AKU and automorphism techniques, we propose a new bootstrapping algorithm for Gaussian secret keys that requires only \r\n$n$ external products and no switching for blind rotation. \r\nBuilding on this, we employ window size optimization and key switching techniques to further improve the algorithm. The improved algorithm provides a useful trade-off between key storage and computational efficiency, depending on the choice of the window size. \r\nCompared to the current fastest FHEW bootstrapping method for Gaussian secret keys (the LLWW+ method proposed by Li et al.), our AKU-based algorithm reduces the number of key switching by 76% and decreases the running time of bootstrapping by 20.7%. At this time, the practical runtime for bootstrapping is approximately equal to that of performing only $n$ external products.",

    "abstract": "CKKS is a homomorphic encryption (HE) scheme that supports arithmetic over complex numbers in an approximate manner. \r\nDespite its utility in PPML protocols, formally defining the security of CKKS-based protocols is challenging due to its approximate nature.\r\nTo be precise, in a sender-receiver model, where the receiver holds input ciphertexts and the sender evaluates its private circuit, it is difficult to define sender's privacy in terms of indistinguishability, whereas receiver's privacy is easily achieved through the semantic security of CKKS.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present a new definition for CKKS-based protocols, called Differentially Private Homomorphic Evaluation (DPHE) protocols, along with a general method to achieve this.\r\nIn our definition, we relax the sender\u2019s privacy condition from indistinguishability to differential privacy notion. \r\nWe focus on the fact that most security concern for PPML protocols is differential privacy on evaluation results, rather than the simulatability of the evaluation.\r\nWe prove that if the ideal functionality satisfies differential privacy and a protocol satisfies DPHE, then the output of the protocol also satisfies differential privacy.\r\n\r\nNext, we provide a general compiler that transforms a plain CKKS-based protocol into a DPHE one. \r\nWe achieve this by mixing the Laplace mechanism and zero-knowledge argument of knowledge (ZKAoK) for CKKS. \r\nThis approach allows us to achieve sender's privacy with a moderate noise, whereas the previous indistinguishability-based approach requires exponentially large overhead.\r\n\r\nFinally, we provide a concrete instantiation of ZKAoK for CKKS in the form of PIOP.\r\nTo prove the well-formedness of CKKS ciphertexts and public keys, we devise new proof techniques that use homomorphic evaluation during verification.\r\nWe also provide an implementation to demonstrate the practicality of our ZKAoK for CKKS by compiling PIOPs using the HSS polynomial commitment scheme (Crypto'24).",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of constructing efficient pseudorandom functions with Beyond-Birthday-Bound (BBB) security from blockciphers. More specifically, we are interested in variable-output-length pseudorandom functions (PRF) whose domain is twice that of the underlying blockcipher. We present two such constructions, $\\textsf{Pencil}$ and $\\sharp\\textsf{Pencil}$, which provide weak PRF and full PRF security, respectively, where both achieve full $n$-bit security. While several recent works have focused on constructing BBB PRFs from blockciphers, much less attention has been given to weak PRF constructions which can potentially be constructed more efficiently and still serve as a useful primitive. Another understudied problem in this domain, is that of extending the domain of a BBB PRF, which turns out to be rather challenging. Besides being of theoretical interest in itself, this is also a very practical problem. Often, the input to the BBB PRF is a nonce, but random nonces are much easier to handle in practice as they do not require maintaining state---which can be very cumbersome in distributed systems and encrypted cloud storage. Accordingly, in order to maintain a BBB security bound, one requires random nonces of size between $1.5n$ and $2n$ bits long and corresponding BBB (weak) PRF constructions that admit matching input sizes. NIST has recently announced a pre-draft call for comments to standardise AEAD schemes that can encrypt larger amounts of data and admit larger nonces. The call lists two approaches. The first is to define an analogue of GCM using a 256-bit blockcipher, and the second is based on a recent proposal by Gueron, to extend GCM with a key derivation function (KDF) called DNDK to increase its security. In essence, DNDK is a BBB-secure expanding weak pseudorandom function with a domain size of 192 bits that is realised from AES. Our work makes relevant contributions to this domain in two important ways. Firstly, an immediate consequence of our work is that one can construct a GCM analogue with BBB security from $\\sharp\\textsf{Pencil}$, without resorting to a 256-bit blockcipher. Our second contribution is that $\\sharp\\textsf{Pencil}$ can be used as a KDF in combination with GCM in an analogous manner to DNDK-GCM. However, $\\sharp\\textsf{Pencil}$ being a full PRF as opposed to DNDK which is only a weak PRF, allows one to prove the KDF-GCM composition secure as an AEAD scheme. Finally, when contrasting $\\textsf{Pencil}$ and DNDK as weak PRFs with comparable parameters, our construction requires only half the blockcipher calls.",

    "abstract": "In pairing-based cryptography, final exponentiation with a large fixed exponent is crucial for ensuring unique outputs in Tate and optimal Ate pairings. While optimizations for elliptic curves with even embedding degrees have been well-explored, progress for curves with odd embedding degrees, particularly those divisible by $3$, has been more limited. This paper presents new optimization techniques for computing the final exponentiation of the optimal Ate pairing on these curves. The first exploits the fact that some existing seeds have a form enabling cyclotomic cubing and extends this to generate new seeds with the same form. The second is to generate new seeds with sparse ternary representations, replacing squaring with cyclotomic cubing. The first technique improves efficiency by $1.7\\%$ and $1.5\\%$ compared to the square and multiply (\\textbf{SM}) method for existing seeds at $192$-bit and $256$-bit security levels, respectively. For newly generated seeds, it achieves efficiency gains of $3.6\\%$ at $128$-bit, $5\\%$ at $192$-bit, and $8.5\\%$ at $256$-bit security levels. The second technique  improves efficiency by $3.3\\%$ at $128$-bit, $19.5\\%$ at $192$-bit, and $4.3\\%$ at $256$-bit security levels.",

    "abstract": "S-boxes are the most popular nonlinear building blocks used in symmetric-key primitives. \r\n  Both cryptographic properties and implementation cost of an S-box are crucial for a good cipher design, especially for lightweight ones. \r\n  This paper aims to determine the exact minimum area of optimal 4-bit S-boxes (whose differential uniform and linearity are both 4) under certain standard cell library. \r\n  Firstly, we evaluate the upper and lower bounds upon the minimum area of S-boxes, by proposing a Prim-like greedy algorithm and utilizing properties of balanced Boolean functions to construct bijective S-boxes. \r\n  Secondly, an SAT-aided automatic search tool is proposed that can simultaneously consider multiple cryptographic properties such as the uniform, linearity, algebraic degree, and the implementation costs such as area, and gate depth complexity. \r\n  Thirdly, thanks to our tool, we manage to find the exact minimum area for different types of 4-bit S-boxes. \r\n  \r\n  The measurement in this paper uses the gate equivalent (GE) as standard unit under UMC 180 nm library, all 2/3/4-input logic gates are taken into consideration. \r\n  Our results show that the minimum area of optimal 4-bit S-box is 11 GE and the depth is 3. \r\n  If we do not use the 4-input gates, this minimum area increases to 12 GE and the depth in this case is 4, which is the same if we only use 2-input gates.\r\n  If we further require that the S-boxes should not have fixed points, the minimum area continue increasing a bit to 12.33 GE while keeping the depth. \r\n  Interestingly, the same results are also obtained for non-optimal 4-bit bijective S-boxes as long as their differential uniform $\\mathcal{U}(S) <16$ and linearity $\\mathcal{L}(S) < 8$ (i.e., there is no non-trivial linear structures) if only 2-input and 3-input gates are used. But the minimum area reduce to 9 GE if 4-input gates are involved.  \r\n  More strictly, if we require the algebraic degree of all coordinate functions of optimal S-boxes be 3, the minimum area is 14 GE with fixed point and 14.33 GE without fixed point, and the depth increases sharply to 8. \r\n  \r\nBesides determining the exact minimum area, our tool is also useful to search for a better implementation of existing S-boxes. As a result, we find out an implementation of Keccak's 5-bit S-box with 17 GE. As a contrast, the designer's original circuit has an area of 23.33 GE, while the optimized result by Lu et al. achieves an area of 17.66 GE. Also, we find out the first optimized implementation of SKINNY's 8-bit S-box with 26.67 GE.",

    "abstract": "A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) enables multiple parties to collectively manage digital assets in a blockchain setting. We focus on achieving fair exchange between DAOs using a cryptographic mechanism that operates with minimal blockchain assumptions and, crucially, does not rely on smart contracts.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, we consider a setting where a DAO consisting of $n_\\mathsf{S}$ sellers holding shares of a witness $w$ interacts with a DAO comprising $n_\\mathsf{B}$ buyers holding shares of a signing key $sk$; the goal is for the sellers to exchange $w$ for a signature under $sk$ transferring a predetermined amount of funds.  \r\nFairness is required to hold both between DAOs (i.e., ensuring that each DAO receives its asset if and only if the other does) as well as within each DAO (i.e., ensuring that all members of a DAO receive their asset if and only if every other member does).  \r\n\r\nWe formalize these fairness properties and present an efficient protocol for DAO-based fair exchange under standard cryptographic assumptions. Our protocol leverages certified witness encryption and threshold adaptor signatures, two primitives of independent interest that we introduce and show how to construct efficiently.",

    "abstract": "Indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) stands out as a powerful cryptographic primitive but remains notoriously difficult to realize under simple-to-state, post-quantum assumptions. Recent works have proposed lattice-inspired iO constructions backed by new \u201cLWE-with-hints\u201d assumptions, which posit that certain distributions of LWE samples retain security despite auxiliary information. However, subsequent cryptanalysis has revealed structural vulnerabilities in these assumptions, leaving us without any post-quantum iO candidates supported by simple, unbroken assumptions.\r\n\r\nMotivated by these proposals, we introduce the \\emph{Circular Security with Random Opening} (CRO) assumption\u2014a new LWE-with-hint assumption that addresses structural weaknesses from prior assumptions, and based on our systematic examination, does not appear vulnerable to known cryptanalytic techniques. In CRO, the hints are random ``openings'' of zero-encryptions under the Gentry--Sahai--Waters (GSW) homomorphic encryption scheme. Crucially, these zero-encryptions are efficiently derived from the original LWE samples via a special, carefully designed procedure, ensuring that the openings are marginally random. Moreover, the openings do not induce any natural leakage on the LWE noises.\r\nThese two features--- marginally random hints and the absence of (natural) noise leakage---rule out important classes of attacks that had undermined all previous LWE-with-hint assumptions for iO. Therefore, our new lattice-based assumption for iO provides a qualitatively different target for cryptanalysis compared to existing assumptions.\r\n\r\nTo build iO under this less-structured CRO assumption, we develop several new technical ideas. In particular, we devise an oblivious LWE sampling procedure, which succinctly encodes random LWE secrets and smudging noises, and uses a tailored-made homomorphic evaluation procedure to generate secure LWE samples. Crucially, all non-LWE components in this sampler, including the secrets and noises of the generated samples, are independently and randomly distributed, avoiding attacks on non-LWE components. \r\n\r\nIn the second part of this work, we investigate recent constructions of obfuscation for pseudorandom functionalities. We show that the same cryptanalytic techniques used to break previous LWE-with-hints assumptions for iO (Hopkins-Jain-Lin CRYPTO 21) can be adapted to construct counterexamples against the private-coin evasive LWE assumptions underlying these pseudorandom obfuscation schemes.\r\nUnlike prior counterexamples for private-coin evasive LWE assumptions, our new counterexamples take the form of zeroizing attacks, contradicting the common belief that evasive-LWE assumptions circumvent zeroizing attacks by restricting to ``evasive'' or pseudorandom functionalities.",

    "abstract": "A tuple of NP statements $(x_1, \\ldots, x_k)$ satisfies a monotone policy $P \\colon \\{0,1\\}^k \\to \\{0,1\\}$ if $P(b_1,\\ldots,b_k)=1$, where $b_i = 1$ if and only if $x_i$ is in the NP language. A monotone-policy batch argument (monotone-policy BARG) for NP is a natural extension of regular batch arguments (BARGs) that allows a prover to prove that $x_1, \\ldots, x_k$ satisfy a monotone policy $P$ with a proof of size $\\mathsf{poly}(\\lambda, |\\mathcal{R}|, \\log k)$, where $|\\mathcal{R}|$ is the size of the Boolean circuit computing the NP relation $\\mathcal{R}$.\r\n\r\nPreviously, Brakerski, Brodsky, Kalai, Lombardi, and Paneth (CRYPTO 2023) and Nassar, Waters, and Wu (TCC 2024) showed how to construct monotone-policy BARGs from (somewhere-extractable) BARGs for NP together with a leveled homomorphic encryption scheme (Brakerski et al.) or an additively homomorphic encryption scheme over a sufficiently-large group (Nassar et al.). In this work, we improve upon both works by showing that BARGs together with additively homomorphic encryption over any group suffices (e.g., over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$). For instance, we can instantiate the additively homomorphic encryption with the classic Goldwasser-Micali encryption scheme based on the quadratic residuosity (QR) assumption. Then, by appealing to existing compilers, we also obtain a monotone-policy aggregate signature scheme from any somewhere-extractable BARG and the QR assumption.",

    "abstract": "Oblivious Transfer (OT) is a significant two party privacy preserving cryptographic primitive. OT involves a sender having several pieces of information and a receiver having a choice bit. The choice bit represents the piece of information that the receiver wants to obtain as an output of OT. At the end of the protocol, sender remains oblivious about the choice bit and receiver remains oblivious to the contents of the information that were not chosen. It has applications ranging from secure multi-party computation, privacy-preserving protocols to cryptographic protocols for secure communication. Most of the classical OT protocols are based on number theoretic assumptions which are not quantum secure and existing quantum OT protocols are not so efficient and practical. Herein, we present the design and analysis of a simple yet efficient quantum OT protocol, namely qOT. qOT is designed by using the asymmetric key distribution proposed by Gao et al. [18] as a building block. The designed qOT requires only single photons as a source of a quantum state, and the measurements of the states are computed using single particle projective measurement. These make qOT efficient and practical. Our proposed design is secure against quantum attacks. Moreover, qOT also provides long-term security.",

    "abstract": "At Crypto 2021, May presented an algorithm solving the ternary Learning-With-Error problem, where the solution is a ternary vector $s\\in\\{0,\\pm 1\\}^{n}$ with a known number of $(+1)$ and $(-1)$ entries. This attack significantly improved the time complexity of $\\mathcal{S}^{0.5}$ from previously known algorithms to $\\mathcal{S}^{0.25}$, where $\\mathcal{S}$ is the size of the key space. Therefore, May exploited that using more representations, i.e., allowing ternary interim results with additional $(+1)$ and $(-1)$ entries, reduces the overall time complexity.\r\n\r\nLater, van Hoof et al. (PQCrypto 2021) combined May's algorithm with quantum walks to a new attack that performs in time $\\mathcal{S}^{0.19}$. However, this quantum attack requires an exponential amount of qubits. This work investigates whether the ternary LWE problem can also be solved using only $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ qubits. Therefore, we look closely into Dicke states, which are an equal superposition over all binary vectors with a fixed Hamming weight. Generalizing Dicke states to ternary vectors makes these states applicable to the ternary LWE problem.\r\n\r\nB\u00e4rtschi and Eidenbenz (FCT 2019) proposed a quantum circuit to prepare binary Dicke states deterministically in linear time $\\mathcal{O}(n)$. Their procedure benefits from the inductive structure of Dicke states, i.e., that a Dicke state of a particular dimension can be built from Dicke states of lower dimensions. Our work proves that this inductive structure is also present in generalized Dicke states with an underlying set other than $\\{0,1\\}^{n}$. Utilizing this structure, we introduce a new algorithm that deterministically prepares generalized Dicke states in linear time, for which we also provide an implementation in Qiskit.\r\n\r\nFinally, we apply our generalized Dicke states to the ternary LWE problem, and construct an algorithm that requires $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ qubits and classical memory space up to $\\mathcal{S}^{0.22}$. We achieve $\\mathcal{S}^{0.379}$ as best obtainable time complexity.",

    "abstract": "Secure multi-party computation (MPC) enables collaborative, privacy-preserving computation over private inputs. Advances in homomorphic encryption (HE), particularly the CKKS scheme, have made secure computation practical, making it well-suited for real-world applications involving approximate computations. However, the inherent approximation errors in CKKS present significant challenges in developing MPC protocols.\r\n\r\nThis paper investigates the problem of secure approximate MPC from CKKS. We first analyze CKKS-based protocols in two-party setting. When only one party holds a private input and the other party acts as an evaluator, a simple protocol with the noise smudging technique on the encryptor's side achieves security in the standard manner. When both parties have private inputs, we demonstrate that the protocol incorporating independent errors from each party achieves a relaxed standard security notion, referred to as a liberal security. Nevertheless, such a protocol fails to satisfy the standard security definition. To address this limitation, we propose a novel protocol that employs a distributed sampling approach to generate smudging noise in a secure manner, which satisfies the standard security definition. \r\n\r\nFinally, we extend the two-party protocols to the multi-party setting. Since the existing threshold CKKS-based MPC protocol only satisfies the liberal security, we present a novel multi-party protocol achieving the standard security by applying multi-party distributed sampling of a smudging error. \r\n\r\nFor all the proposed protocols, we formally define the functionalities and provide rigorous security analysis within the simulation-based security framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly define the functionality of CKKS-based approximate MPC and achieve formal security guarantees.",

    "abstract": "Differential cryptanalysis is a powerful technique for attacking block ciphers, wherein the Markov cipher assumption and stochastic hypothesis are commonly employed to simplify the search and probability estimation of differential trails. However, these assumptions often neglect inherent algebraic constraints, potentially resulting in invalid trails and inaccurate probability estimates. Some studies identified violations of these assumptions and explored how they impose constraints on key material, but they have not yet fully captured all relevant ones. This study proposes Trail-Estimator, an automated verifier for differential trails on block ciphers, consisting of two parts: a constraint detector Cons-Collector and a solving tool Cons-Solver. We first establish the fundamental principles that will allow us to systematically identify all constraint subsets within a differential trail, upon which Cons-Collector is built. Then, Cons-Solver utilizes specialized preprocessing techniques to efficiently solve the detected constraint subsets, thereby determining the key space and providing a comprehensive probability distribution of differential trails. To validate its effectiveness, Trail-Estimator is applied to verify 14 differential trails for the SKINNY, LBLOCK, and TWINE block ciphers. Experimental results show that Trail-Estimator consistently identifies previously undetected constraints for SKINNY and discovers constraints for the first time for LBLOCK and TWINE. Notably, it is the first tool to discover long nonlinear constraints extending beyond five rounds in these ciphers. Furthermore, Trail-Estimator's accuracy is validated by experiments showing its predictions closely match the real probability distribution of short-round differential trails.",

    "note": "On 2025-02-21, Kuchta, LeGrow and Persichetti ([KLP25]) proposed a construction of blind signatures from matrix code equivalence ( https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/274). The framework also follows that in CSI-Otter, with a focus on matrix code equivalence. To resolve issues caused by non-commutativity, the authors make use of the actions of both $A$ and its inverse transpose $A^{-T}$ for an invertible matrix $A$, and require $A$ to be (anti)symmetric. The security of the scheme relies on  the hardness assumption of the Modified Inverse Matrix Code Equivalence Problem (MIMCE), a computational version of Inverse Matrix Code Equivalence Problem (IMCE). IMCE was recently attacked by Budroni et al. ([BCDSK24]) (Asiacrypt'24, https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/244), and this attack was not discussed in [KLP25].\r\n\r\nIn contrast, our framework is applicable for general (non-commutative) group actions. One requirement for instantiating our scheme is the reuse of secret keys, which leads us to propose the use of symmetric group action to equivalence classes of linear codes under the action of general linear group and diagonal group. This viewpoint helps to thwart the attack of reusing keys as in [BCDSK24].",

    "abstract": "Abdalla et al. (ASIACRYPT 2020) introduced a notion of identity-based inner-product functional encryption (IBIPFE) that combines identity-based encryption and inner-product functional encryption (IPFE). Thus far, several pairing-based and lattice-based IBIPFE schemes have been proposed. However, there are two open problems. First, there are no known IBIPFE schemes that satisfy the adaptive simulation-based security. Second, known IBIPFE schemes that satisfy the adaptive indistinguishability-based security or the selective simulation-based security do not have tight reductions. In this paper, we propose lattice-based and pairing-based IBIPFE schemes that satisfy the tight adaptive simulation-based security. At first, we propose a generic transformation from an indistinguishability-based secure $(L + 1)$-dimensional (IB)IPFE scheme to a simulation-based secure $L$-dimensional (IB)IPFE scheme. The proposed transformation improves Agrawal et al.'s transformation for plain IPFE (PKC 2020) that requires an indistinguishability-based secure $2L$-dimensional scheme. Then, we construct a lattice-based IBIPFE scheme that satisfies the tight adaptive indistinguishability-based security under the LWE assumption in the quantum random oracle model. We apply the proposed transformation and obtain the first lattice-based IBIPFE scheme that satisfies adaptive simulation-based security. Finally, we construct a pairing-based IBIPFE scheme that satisfies the tight adaptive simulation-based security under the DBDH assumption in the random oracle model. The pairing-based scheme does not use the proposed transformation towards the best efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The concept of anamorphic encryption, first formally introduced by Persiano et al. in their influential 2022 paper titled ``Anamorphic Encryption: Private Communication Against a Dictator,'' enables embedding covert messages within ciphertexts. One of the key distinctions between a ciphertext embedding a covert message and an original ciphertext, compared to an anamorphic ciphertext, lies in the indistinguishability between the original ciphertext and the anamorphic ciphertext. This encryption procedure has been defined based on a public-key cryptosystem. Initially, we present a quantum analogue of the classical anamorphic encryption definition that is based on public-key encryption. Additionally, we introduce a definition of quantum anamorphic encryption that relies on symmetric key encryption. Furthermore, we provide a detailed generalized construction of quantum anamorphic symmetric key encryption within a general framework, which involves taking any two quantum density matrices of any different dimensions and constructing a single quantum density matrix, which is the quantum anamorphic ciphertext containing ciphertexts of both of them. Subsequently, we introduce a definition of computational anamorphic secret-sharing and extend the work of \\c{C}akan et al. on computational quantum secret-sharing to computational quantum anamorphic secret-sharing, specifically addressing scenarios with multiple messages, multiple keys, and a single share function. This proposed secret-sharing scheme demonstrates impeccable security measures against quantum adversaries.",

    "abstract": "Cryptographic group actions have attracted growing attention as a useful tool for constructing cryptographic schemes. \r\nAmong their applications, commitment schemes are particularly interesting as fundamental primitives, playing a crucial role in protocols such as zero-knowledge proofs, multi-party computation, and more.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel framework to construct commitment schemes based on cryptographic group actions. \r\nSpecifically, we propose two key techniques for general group actions: re-randomization and randomness extraction. \r\nRoughly speaking, a re-randomization algorithm introduces randomness within an orbit for any input element, while a randomness extractor maps this randomness to uniformity over the message space.\r\nWe demonstrate that these techniques can significantly facilitate the construction of commitment schemes, providing a flexible framework for constructing either perfectly hiding or perfectly binding commitments, depending on the type of extractor involved. \r\nMoreover, we extend our framework to support the construction of commitments with additional desirable properties beyond hiding and binding, such as dual-mode commitments and enhanced linkable commitments. \r\nThese extensions are achieved by further adapting the extractor to satisfy trapdoor or homomorphic properties.\r\nFinally, we instantiate all our proposed commitment schemes using lattices, specifically leveraging the lattice isomorphism problem (LIP) and the lattice automorphism problem (LAP) as underlying cryptographic assumptions. \r\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first commitment scheme construction based on LIP/LAP. \r\nAdditionally, we use LIP to provide a repair and improvement to the tensor isomorphism-based non-interactive commitment scheme proposed by D'Alconzo, Flamini, and Gangemi (ASIACRYPT 2023), which was recently shown to be insecure by an attack from Gilchrist, Marco, Petit, and Tang (CRYPTO 2024).",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present the first practical algorithm to compute an effective group action of the class group of any imaginary quadratic order $\\mathcal{O}$ on a set of supersingular elliptic curves primitively oriented by $\\mathcal{O}$. Effective means that we can act with any element of the class group directly, and are not restricted to acting by products of ideals of small norm, as for instance in CSIDH. Such restricted effective group actions often hamper cryptographic constructions, e.g. in signature or MPC protocols.\r\n\r\nOur algorithm is a refinement of the Clapoti approach by Page and Robert, and uses $4$-dimensional isogenies. As such, it runs in polynomial time, does not require the computation of the structure of the class group, nor expensive lattice reductions, and our refinements allows it to be instantiated with the orientation given by the Frobenius endomorphism. This makes the algorithm practical even at security levels as high as CSIDH-4096. Our implementation in SageMath takes 1.5s to compute a group action at the CSIDH-512 security level, 21s at CSIDH-2048 level and around 2 minutes at the CSIDH-4096 level. This marks the first instantiation of an effective cryptographic group action at such high security levels. For comparison, the recent KLaPoTi approach requires around 200s at the CSIDH-512 level in SageMath and 2.5s in Rust.",

    "abstract": "Differential cryptanalysis, along with its variants such as boomerang attacks, is widely used to evaluate the security of block ciphers. These cryptanalytic techniques often rely on assumptions like the \\textit{hypothesis of stochastic equivalence} and \\textit{Markov ciphers assumption}. Recently, more attention has been paid to verifying whether differential characteristics (DCs) meet these assumptions, finding both positive and negative results.\r\nA part of these efforts includes the automatic search methods for both the value and difference propagation (e.g., Liu et al. CRYPTO 2020, Nageler et al. ToSC 2025/1), structural constraints analysis (e.g., Tan and Peyrin, ToSC 2022/4), and the quasidifferential (Beyne and Rijmen, CRYPTO 2022).  \r\nNevertheless, less attention has been paid to the related-key DCs and boomerang distinguishers, where the same assumptions are used. To the best of our knowledge, only some related-tweakey DCs of \\skinny were checked thanks to its linear word-based key-schedule, and no similar work is done for boomerang distinguishers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe verification of related-key DCs and boomerang distinguishers is as important as that of DCs, as they often hold the longest attack records for block ciphers.\r\nThis paper focuses on investigating the validity of DCs in the related-key setting and boomerang distinguishers in both single- and related-key scenarios.\r\nFor this purpose, we generalize Beyne and Rijmen's quasidifferential techniques for the related-key DCs and boomerang attacks.\r\n\r\nFirst, to verify related-key DCs, the related-key quasi-DC is proposed. Similar to the relationship between the quasi-DC and DC, the exact probability of a related-key DC is equal to the sum of all corresponding related-key quasi-DCs' correlations.\r\nSince the related-key quasi-DCs involve the key information, we can determine the probability of the target related-key DC in different key subspaces. \r\nWe find both positive and negative results.\r\nFor example, we verify the 18-round related-key DC used in the best attack on \\gift-64 whose probability is $2^{-58}$, finding that this related-key DC has a higher probability for $2^{128} \\times (2^{-5} + 2^{-8})$ keys which is around $2^{-50}$, but it is impossible for the remaining keys.\r\n\r\nSecond, we identify proper bases to describe the boomerang distinguishers with the geometric approach. A quasi-BCT is constructed to consider the value influence in the boomerang connectivity table (BCT). For the DC parts, the quasi-biDDT is used. Connecting the quasi-BCT and quasi-biDDT, we can verify the probability of a boomerang distinguisher with quasi-boomerang characteristics. \r\nThis also allows us to analyze the probability of the boomerang in different key spaces. \r\nFor a 17-round boomerang distinguisher of \\skinny-64-128 whose probability is $2^{-50}$, we find that the probability can be $2^{-44}$ for half of keys, and impossible for the other half.",

    "abstract": "In the past three decades, we have witnessed the creation of various cryptanalytic attacks. However, relatively little research has been done on their potential underlying connections. The geometric approach, developed by Beyne in 2021, shows that a cipher can be viewed as a linear operation when we treat its input and output as points in an induced \\textit{free vector space}.\r\nBy performing a change of basis for the input and output spaces, one can obtain various transition matrices. Linear, differential, and (ultrametic) integral attacks have been well reinterpreted by Beyne's theory in a unified way.\r\n\r\nThus far, the geometric approach always uses the same basis for the input and output spaces. We observe here that this restriction is unnecessary and allowing different bases makes the geometric approach more flexible and able to interpret/predict more attack types. Given some set of bases for the input and output spaces, a family of basis-based attacks is defined by combining them, and all attacks in this family can be studied in a unified automatic search method. \r\n\r\nWe revisit three kinds of bases from previous geometric approach papers and extend them to four extra ones by introducing new rules when generating new bases. With the final seven bases, we can obtain $7^{2d}$ different basis-based attacks in the $d$-th order spaces, where the \\textit{order} is defined as the number of messages used in one sample during the attack. \r\n\r\nWe then provide four examples of applications of this new framework. First, we show that by choosing a better pair of bases, Beyne and Verbauwhede's ultrametric integral cryptanalysis can be interpreted as a single element of a transition matrix rather than as a linear combination of elements. This unifies the ultrametric integral cryptanalysis with the previous linear and quasi-differential attacks.\r\nSecond, we revisit the multiple-of-$n$ property with our refined geometric approach and exhibit new multiple-of-$n$ distinguishers that can reach more rounds of the \\skinny-64 cipher than the state-of-the-art.\r\nThird, we study the multiple-of-$n$ property for the first-order case, which is similar to the subspace trail but it is the divisibility property that is considered. This leads to a new distinguisher for 11-round-reduced \\skinny-64. \r\nFinally, we give a closed formula for differential-linear approximations without any assumptions, even confirming that the two differential-linear approximations of \\simeck-32 and \\simeck-48 found by Hadipour \\textit{et al.} are deterministic independently of concrete key values.  \r\nWe emphasize that all these applications were not possible before.",

    "abstract": "We present a new generalization of (zk-)SNARKs combining two additional features at the same time. Besides the verification of correct computation, our new SNARKs also allow, first, the verification of input data authenticity. Specifically, a verifier can confirm that the input to the computation originated from a trusted source. Second, our SNARKs support verification of stateful computations across multiple rounds, ensuring that the output of the current round correctly depends on the internal state of the previous round. Our SNARKs are specifically suited to applications in cyber-physical control systems, where computations are periodically carried out and need to be checked immediately. Our focus is on concrete practicality, so we abstain from arithmetizing hash functions or signatures in our SNARKs. Rather, we modify the internals of an existing SNARK to extend its functionality. Additionally, we present new optimizations to reduce proof size, prover time, and verification time in our setting. With our construction, prover runtime improves significantly over the baseline by a factor of 89. Verification time is 70 % less for computations on authenticated data and 33 % less for stateful computations. To demonstrate relevance and practicality, we implement and benchmark our new SNARKs in a sample real-world scenario with\r\na (simple) quadcopter flight control system.",

    "abstract": "Distributed randomness beacon protocols, which generate publicly verifiable randomness at regular intervals, are crucial for a wide range of applications. The publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) scheme is a promising cryptographic primitive for implementing beacon protocols, such as Hydrand (S\\&P '20) and SPURT (S\\&P '22). However, two key challenges for practical deployment remain unresolved: asynchrony and reconfiguration. In this paper, we introduce the $AsyRand$ beacon protocol to address these challenges. In brief, $AsyRand$ leverages Bracha Reliable Broadcast (BRB) or BRB-like protocols for message dissemination and incorporates a producer-consumer model to decouple the production and consumption of PVSS commitments.  In the producer-consumer model, PVSS commitments are produced and consumed using a queue data structure. Specifically, the producer process is responsible for generating new PVSS commitments and reaching consensus on them within the queue, while the consumer process continuously consumes the commitments to recover PVSS secrets and generate new beacon values. This separation allows the producer and consumer processes to operate simultaneously and asynchronously, without the need for a global clock. Moreover, the producer-consumer model enables each party to detect potential faults in other parties by monitoring the queue length. If necessary, parties in $AsyRand$ can initiate a removal process for faulty parties. BRB is also employed to facilitate the addition of new parties without requiring a system restart. In summary, $AsyRand$ supports reconfiguration, enhancing both the protocol's usability and reliability. Additionally, we propose a novel PVSS scheme based on the $\\Sigma$ protocol, which is of independent interest. Regarding complexity, $AsyRand$ achieves state-of-the-art performance with $O(n^2)$ communication complexity, $O(n)$ computation complexity, and $O(n)$ verification complexity.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first DABE construction (beyond hierarchical identity-based encryption) that achieves full security without relying on complexity leveraging. Our DABE supports an unbounded number of key delegations, and the secret key size grows just linearly with each key delegation operation.",

    "abstract": "Hiding the metadata in Internet protocols serves to protect user privacy, dissuade traffic analysis, and prevent network ossification. Fully encrypted protocols require even the initial key exchange to be obfuscated: a passive observer should be unable to distinguish a protocol execution from an exchange of random bitstrings. Deployed obfuscated key exchanges such as Tor's pluggable transport protocol obfs4 are Diffie\u2013Hellman-based, and rely on the Elligator encoding for obfuscation. Recently, G\u00fcnther, Stebila, and Veitch (CCS '24) proposed a post-quantum variant pq-obfs, using a novel building block called obfuscated key encapsulation mechanisms (OKEMs): KEMs whose public keys and ciphertexts look like random bitstrings.\r\n\r\nFor transitioning real-world protocols, pure post-quantum security is not enough. Many are taking a hybrid approach, combining traditional and post-quantum schemes to hedge against security failures in either component. While hybrid KEMs are already widely deployed (e.g., in TLS 1.3), existing hybridization techniques fail to provide hybrid obfuscation guarantees for OKEMs. Further, even if a hybrid OKEM existed, the pq-obfs protocol would still not achieve hybrid obfuscation.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we address these challenges by presenting the first OKEM combiner that achieves hybrid IND-CCA security with hybrid ciphertext obfuscation guarantees, and using this to build Drivel, a modification of pq-obfs that is compatible with hybrid OKEMs. Our OKEM combiner allows for a variety of practical instantiations, e.g., combining obfuscated versions of DHKEM and ML-KEM. We additionally provide techniques to achieve unconditional public key obfuscation for LWE-based OKEMs, and explore broader applications of hybrid OKEMs, including a construction of the first hybrid password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocol secure against adaptive corruptions in the UC model.",

    "abstract": "Threshold fully homomorphic encryption (ThFHE) is an extension of FHE that can be applied to multiparty computation (MPC) with low round complexity. Recently, Passel\u00e8gue and Stehl\u00e9 (Asiacrypt 2024) presented a simulation-secure ThFHE scheme with polynomially small decryption shares from \u201cyet another\u201d learning with errors assumption (LWE), in which the norm of the secret key is leaked to the adversary. While \u201cyet another\u201d LWE is reduced from standard LWE, its module variant, \u201cyet another\u201d module-LWE (MLWE), lacks a known reduction from standard MLWE. Because of this, it is left as an open question to extend their scheme to the MLWE-based construction.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we address this open problem: we propose a simulation-secure ThFHE scheme with polynomially small decryption shares whose security is (directly) reduced from standard LWE/MLWE. Our core technique, which we call \u201cnoise padding\u201d, eliminates the need of \u201cyet another\u201d assumptions: we distribute shares of a small error and use them to adjust the distribution of decryption noise so that no information about the secret key is leaked. As side benefits of our construction, our ThFHE efficiently realizes arbitrary T-out-of-N threshold decryption via simple Shamir secret sharing instead of {0, 1}-linear secret sharing. Furthermore, the sizes of keys, ciphertexts and decryption shares in our scheme are constant w.r.t. the number of parties N ; we achieve compactness w.r.t. N.",

    "abstract": "The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol standard proposes a novel tree-based protocol that enables efficient end-to-end encrypted messaging over large groups with thousands of members. Its functionality can be divided into three components: TreeSync for authenticating and synchronizing group state, TreeKEM for the core group key agreement, and TreeDEM for group message encryption. While previous works have analyzed the security of abstract models of TreeKEM, they do not account for the precise low-level details of the protocol standard. This work presents the first machine-checked security proof for TreeKEM. Our proof is in the symbolic Dolev-Yao model and applies to a bit-level precise, executable, interoperable specification of the protocol. Furthermore, our security theorem for TreeKEM composes naturally with a previous result for TreeSync to provide a strong modular security guarantee for the published MLS standard.",

    "abstract": "We examine the post-quantum security of the Ascon authenticated encryption (AE) mode. In spite of comprehensive research of Ascon's classical security, the potential impact of quantum adversaries on Ascon has not yet been explored much. We investigate the generic security of the Ascon AE mode in the setting where the adversary owns a quantum computer to improve its attack, while the adversarial encryption or decryption queries are still classical. In this so-called Q1 model, Ascon achieves security up to approximately $\\min\\{2^{c/3},2^{k/2}\\}$ evaluations, where $c$ is the capacity, $k$ the key size, and the adversary is block-wise adaptive but restricted to one forgery attempt. Our technique is based on applying the semi-classical one-way to hiding (O2H) lemma, and on tailoring the puncture set to the Ascon mode.\r\nAdditionally, we discuss different parameter choices for Ascon and compare our results to generic quantum attacks, such as Grover-based key search and state recovery.",

    "abstract": "Decentralization is a great enabler for adoption of modern cryptography in real-world systems. Widespread adoption of blockchains and secure multi-party computation protocols are perfect evidentiary examples for dramatic rise in deployment of decentralized cryptographic systems. Much of cryptographic research can be viewed as reducing (or eliminating) the dependence on trusted parties, while shielding from stronger adversarial threats. In this work, we study the problem of multi-authority functional encryption (MAFE), a popular decentralized generalization of functional encryption (FE). Our main contributions are:\r\n\r\n    1. We design MAFE for all poly-sized circuits, in the bounded collusion model, under the minimal assumption of PKE/OWFs. Prior to our work, this required either sub-exponentially secure obfuscation, or $\\log n$-party key exchange, or Random Oracles and sub-exponentially secure PKE. We also extend our constructions to the dynamic collusion model under the minimal assumptions of IBE/OWFs. Unlike all prior works, our MAFE systems are truly dynamic and put no restrictions on the maximum number of authorities.\r\n\r\n    2. Under the hardness of learning with errors (LWE) assumption, we design MAFE for all poly-sized circuits where we allow adversaries to adaptively corrupt local authorities. We allow an adversary to corrupt any $k$ out of $n$ local authorities as long as ${{n}\\choose{k}}$ = poly$(\\lambda)$. Prior to this, such MAFE relied on sub-exponentially secure obfuscation. Additionally, we design a new MAFE compiler for boosting selective authority corruptions to non-adaptive authority corruptions.\r\n\r\n    3. We prove a tight implication from MAFE to (VBB/indistinguishability) obfuscation. We show that MAFE implies obfuscation only if the number of attribute bits (jointly) controlled by all corrupt local authorities is $\\omega(\\log \\lambda)$. This proves optimality of our second result for a wide range of parameters.\r\n\r\n    4. Finally, we propose a new MAFE system that we refer to as multi-authority attribute-based functional encryption (MA-ABFE). We view it as an approach to get best of both worlds (fully collusion resistant MA-ABE, and bounded collusion resistant MAFE). By combining our results with prior MA-ABE results, we obtain MA-ABFE for $\\mathsf{NC}^1 \\circ \\mathsf{P}/\\mathsf{Poly}$ from standard pairing-based assumptions, and for $\\mathsf{DNF} \\circ \\mathsf{P}/\\mathsf{Poly}$ from LWE, both in the Random Oracle Model. We also describe a simple construction of MA-ABE for general predicates from witness encryption, and combining with known results, we also get MA-ABFE for $\\mathsf{P}/\\mathsf{Poly} \\circ \\mathsf{P}/\\mathsf{Poly}$ from evasive LWE.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of shared computation architectures assembled from\r\nheterogeneous chiplets introduces new security threats. Due to the shared logical and physical resources, an untrusted chiplet can act maliciously to surreptitiously probe the data communication between chiplets or sense the computation shared between them. This paper presents Garblet, the first framework to leverage the flexibility offered by chiplet technology and Garbled Circuits (GC)-based MPC to enable efficient, secure computation even in the presence of potentially compromised chiplets. Our approach integrates a customized hardware Oblivious Transfer (OT) module and an optimized evaluator engine into chiplet-based platforms. This configuration distributes the tasks of garbling and evaluating circuits across two chiplets, reducing communication costs and enhancing computation speed. We implement this framework on an AMD/Xilinx UltraScale+ multi-chip module and demonstrate its effectiveness using benchmark functions. Additionally, we introduce a novel circuit decomposition technique that allows for parallel processing across multiple chiplets to further improve computational efficiency. Our results highlight the potential of chiplet systems for accelerating GC (e.g., the time complexity of garbled AES is 0.0226ms) in order to guarantee the security and privacy of the computation on chiplets.",

    "abstract": "We study recent algebraic attacks (Briaud-\u00d8ygarden EC'23) on the Regular Syndrome Decoding (RSD) problem and the assumptions underlying the correctness of their attacks' complexity estimates. By relating these assumptions to interesting algebraic-combinatorial problems, we prove that they do not hold in full generality. However, we show that they are (asymptotically) true for most parameter sets, supporting the soundness of algebraic attacks on RSD. Further, we prove\u2014without any heuristics or assumptions\u2014that RSD can be broken in polynomial time whenever the number of error blocks times the square of the size of error blocks is larger than 2 times the square of the dimension of the code.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we use our methodology to attack a variant of the Learning With Errors problem where each error term lies in a fixed set of constant size. We prove that this problem can be broken in polynomial time, given a sufficient number of samples. This result improves on the seminal work by Arora and Ge (ICALP'11), as the attack's time complexity is independent of the LWE modulus.",

The construction achieves $2^{\\Theta(\\log^{1-\\beta} \\lambda)}$ compression factor. As an application, we obtain a private-information retrieval (PIR) with communication complexity $L / 2^{\\Theta(\\log^{1-\\beta} L)}$, for a database of size L.

    "abstract": "The requirement for privacy-aware machine learning increases as we continue to use PII (Personally Identifiable Information) within machine training. To overcome these privacy issues, we can apply Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to encrypt data before it is fed into a machine learning model. This involves creating a homomorphic encryption key pair, and where the associated public key will be used to encrypt the input data, and the private key will decrypt the output. But, there is often a performance hit when we use homomorphic encryption, and so this paper evaluates the performance overhead of using the SVM machine learning technique with the OpenFHE homomorphic encryption library. This uses Python and the scikit-learn library for its implementation.  The experiments include a range of variables such as multiplication depth, scale size, first modulus size, security level, batch size, and ring dimension, along with two different SVM models, SVM-Poly and SVM-Linear. Overall, the results show that the two main parameters which affect performance are the ring dimension and the modulus size, and that SVM-Poly and SVM-Linear show similar performance levels.",

    "abstract": "Cryptographic proofs allow researchers to provide theoretical guarantees on the security that their constructions provide. A proof of security can completely eliminate a class of attacks by potential adversaries. Human fallibility, however, means that even a proof reviewed by experts may still hide flaws or outright errors. Proof assistants are software tools built for the purpose of formally verifying each step in a proof, and as such have the potential to prevent erroneous proofs from being published and insecure constructions from being implemented.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, existing tooling for verifying cryptographic proofs has found limited adoption in the cryptographic community, in part due to concerns with ease of use. We present ProofFrog: a new tool for verifying cryptographic game-hopping proofs. ProofFrog is designed with the average cryptographer in mind, using an imperative syntax similar to C for specifying games and a syntax for proofs that closely models pen-and-paper arguments. As opposed to other proof assistant tools which largely operate by manipulating logical formulae, ProofFrog manipulates abstract syntax trees (ASTs) into a canonical form to establish indistinguishable or equivalent behaviour for pairs of games in a user-provided sequence. We also detail the domain-specific language developed for use with the ProofFrog proof engine, the exact transformations it applies to canonicalize ASTs, and case studies of verified proofs. A tool like ProofFrog that prioritizes ease of use can lower the barrier of entry to using computer-verified proofs and aid in catching insecure constructions before they are made public.",

    "abstract": "We study linear-time prover SNARKs and make the following contributions:\r\n\r\nWe provide a framework for transforming a univariate polynomial commitment scheme into a multilinear polynomial commitment scheme. Our transformation is generic, can be instantiated with any univariate scheme and improves on prior transformations like Gemini (EUROCRYPT 2022) and Virgo (S&P 2020) in all relevant parameters: proof size, verification complexity, and prover complexity. Instantiating the above framework with the KZG univariate polynomial commitment scheme, we get SamaritanPCS \u2013 the first multilinear polynomial commitment scheme with constant proof size and linear-time prover. SamaritanPCS is a drop-in replacement for the popular PST scheme, and improves upon PST in all relevant parameters.\r\n\r\nWe construct LogSpartan \u2013 a new multilinear PIOP for R1CS based on recent techniques for lookup arguments. Compiling this PIOP using SamaritanPCS gives Samaritan \u2013 a SNARK in the universal and updatable SRS setting. Samaritan has linear-time prover, logarithmic verification and logarithmic proof size. Concretely, its proof size is one of the smallest among other known linear-time prover SNARKs without relying on concretely expensive proof recursion techniques. For an R1CS instance with 1 million constraints, Samaritan (over BLS12-381 curve) has a proof size of 6.7KB.\r\n\r\nWe compare Samaritan with other linear-time prover SNARKs in the updatable setting. We asymptotically improve on the $\\log^2 n$ proof size of Spartan. Unlike Libra (CRYPTO 2019), the argument size of Samaritan is independent of the circuit depth. Compared to Gemini (EUROCRYPT 2022), Samaritan achieves 3$\\times$ smaller argument size at 1 million constraints. We match the argument size of HyperPlonk, which is the smallest linear-time SNARK for the Plonkish constraint system, while achieving slightly better verification complexity.\r\n\r\nWe believe that our transformation and our techniques for applying lookups based on logarithmic derivatives to the multilinear setting are of wider interest.",

    "abstract": "Consider a weak analyst that wishes to outsource data collection and computation of aggregate statistics over a a potentially large population of (also weak) clients to a powerful server. For flexibility and efficiency, we consider public-key and non-interactive protocols, meaning the clients know the analyst's public key but do not share secrets, and each client sends at most one message. Furthermore, the final step should be silent, whereby the analyst simply downloads the (encrypted) result from the server when needed. To capture this setting, we define a new primitive  we call Non-Interactive Verifiable Aggregation (NIVA). \r\nWe require both privacy and robustness for a NIVA protocol to be deemed secure. Namely, our security notion for NIVA ensures that the clients' data remains private to both the server and the analyst, while also ensuring that  malicious clients cannot skew the results by providing faulty data.\r\nWe propose a secure NIVA protocol, which we call PEAR (for Private, Efficient, Accurate, Robust), which can validate inputs according to any NP validity rule.  PEAR is based on a novel combination of functional encryption for inner-products (Abdalla et al., PKC 2015) and fully-linear probabilistically-checkable proofs (Boneh et al., Crypto 2019). We emphasize that PEAR is non-interactive, public-key, and  makes black-box use of the underlying cryptographic primitives. Additionally, we devise substantial  optimizations of PEAR for practically-relevant validity rules. Finally, we implement PEAR to show feasibility for such validity rules,  conducting a thorough performance evaluation. In particular, we compare PEAR to two more straightforward or \"off-the-shelf\" NIVA protocols and show performance gains, demonstrating the merit of our new approach. The bottleneck in our protocol comes from the fact that we require the underlying IPFE scheme to be \"unrestricted\" over a large field. As more efficient such schemes are developed, they can be immediately be plugged into PEAR for further gains.",

This obfuscation based attack is then later formalized by Vaikuntanathan, Wee, and Wichs [VWW22].\r\nIn this note, we revisit their attack and show that the attack actually does not work by showing a concrete counterexample.  We then show that their attack can be made valid with some modifications. Along the way, we also improve the counterexample by making it provable. Specifically, our counterexample is valid assuming the (plain) LWE assumption and the existence of instance-hiding witness encryption, whereas their original counterexample was dependent on the heuristic assumption of the existence of an ideal obfuscation.",

    "abstract": "Private computation on common records refers to analyze data from two databases containing shared records without revealing personal information. As a basic requirement for private computation, the databases involved essentially need to be aligned by a common identification system. However, it is hard to expect such common identifiers in real world scenario. For this reason, multiple quasi-identifiers can be used to identify common records. As some quasi-identifiers might be missing or have typos, it is important to support fuzzy records setting. Identifying common records using quasi-identifiers requires manipulation of highly sensitive information, which could be privacy concerns.\r\n\r\nThis work studies the problem of enabling such data analysis on the fuzzy records of quasi-identifiers. To this end, we propose ordered threshold-one (OTO) matching which can be efficiently realized by circuit-based private set intersection (CPSI) protocols and some multiparty computation (MPC) techniques. Furthermore, we introduce some generic encoding techniques from traditional matching rules to the OTO matching. Finally, we achieve a secure efficient private computation protocol which supports various matching rules which have already been widely used.\r\n\r\nWe also demonstrate the superiority of our proposal with experimental validation. First, we empirically check that our encoding to OTO matching does not affect accuracy a lot for the benchmark datasets found in the fuzzy record matching literature. Second, we implement our protocol and achieve significantly faster performance at the cost of communication overhead compared to previous privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) protocols. In the case of 100K records for each dataset, our work shows 147.58MB communication cost, 10.71s setup time, and 1.97s online time, which is 7.78 times faster compared to the previous work (50.12 times faster when considering online time only).",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the concept of a multi-client functional encryption (MC-FE) scheme for attribute-based inner product functions (AB-IP), initially proposed by Abdalla et al. [ASIACRYPT\u201920], in an unbounded setting. In such a setting, the setup is independent of vector length constraints, allowing secret keys to support functions of arbitrary lengths, and clients can dynamically choose vector lengths during encryption. The functionality outputs the sum of inner products if vector lengths and indices meet a specific relation, and all clients\u2019 attributes satisfy the key\u2019s policy. We propose the following constructions based on the matrix decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption in a natural permissive setting\r\nof unboundedness:\r\n\r\n\u2013 the first multi-client attribute-based unbounded IPFE (MC-AB-UIPFE) scheme secure in the standard model, overcoming previous limitations where clients could only encrypt fixed-length data;\r\n\u2013 the first multi-input AB-UIPFE (MI-AB-UIPFE) in the public key setting; improving upon prior bounded constructions under the same assumption;\r\n\u2013 the first dynamic decentralized UIPFE (DD-UIPFE); enhancing the dynamism property of prior works.\r\n\r\nTechnically, we follow the blueprint of Agrawal et al. [CRYPTO\u201923] but begin with a new unbounded FE called extended slotted unbounded IPFE. We first construct a single-input AB-UIPFE in the standard model and then extend it to multi-input settings. In a nutshell, our work demonstrates the applicability of function-hiding security of IPFE in realizing variants of multi-input FE capable of encoding unbounded\r\nlength vectors both at the time of key generation and encryption.",

    "abstract": "Secure Two-Party Computation (2PC) enables secure inference with cryptographic guarantees that protect the privacy of the model owner and client. However, it adds significant performance overhead. In this work, we make 2PC-based secure inference efficient while considering important deployment scenarios.   \r\nWe observe that the hitherto unconsidered latency of fetching keys from storage significantly impacts performance, as does network speed. We design a Linear Secret Sharing (LSS)-based system $LSS^M$ and a Function Secret Sharing (FSS)-based system $FSS^M$ for secure inference, optimized for small key size and communication, respectively. Notably, our highly-optimized and hardware-aware CPU-based $LSS^M$ outperforms prior GPU-based LSS systems by up to $50\\times$. We then show that the best choice between $LSS^M$ and $FSS^M$ depends on the deployment scenario.\r\nIn fact, under certain deployments, a combination of $LSS^M$ and $FSS^M$ can leverage heterogeneous processing across CPU and GPU. Such protocol-system co-design lets us outperform state-of-the-art secure inference systems \r\nby up to $21\\times$ (geomean $3.25\\times$).",

    "abstract": "The Message Layer Security (MLS) protocol has recently been standardized by the IETF. MLS is a scalable secure group messaging protocol expected to run more efficiently compared to the Signal protocol at scale, while offering a similar level of strong security. Even though MLS has undergone extensive examination by researchers, the majority of the works have focused on confidentiality.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we focus on the authenticity of the application messages exchanged in MLS. Currently, MLS authenticates every application message with an EdDSA signature and while manageable, the overhead is greatly amplified in the post-quantum setting as the NIST-recommended Dilithium signature results in a 40x increase in size. We view this as an invitation to explore new authentication modes that can be used instead. We start by taking a systematic view on how application messages are authenticated in MLS and categorize authenticity into four different security notions. We then propose several authentication modes, offering a range of different efficiency and security profiles. For instance, in one of our modes, COSMOS++, we replace signatures with one-time tokens and a MAC tag, offering roughly a 75x savings in the post-quantum communication overhead. While this comes at the cost of weakening security compared to the authentication mode used by MLS, the lower communication overhead seems to make it a worthwhile trade-off with security.",

    "abstract": "We explore advanced security notions for threshold signature schemes, focusing on Beyond UnForgeability Features (BUFF), introduced by Cremers et al. (S&P\u201921)  in the non-threshold setting. The BUFF properties protect against attacks based on maliciously chosen keys, e.g., expropriating a message-signature pair under a new public key (called exclusive ownership). We first formalize these notions in the threshold setting and examine their relationships. Notably, unlike regular signature schemes, the hierarchy of variants of exclusive ownership notions only holds for threshold schemes if they are also robust.\r\nWe then present a generic compiler that transforms any threshold signature scheme to satisfy exclusive ownership, and message-bound signature properties with minimal overhead. Furthermore, we modify the threshold BLS signature scheme to achieve these additional properties without increasing the signature size. Lastly, we identify specific structures in threshold signature schemes where BUFF properties can be naturally extended from the underlying standard signature scheme, and we analyze and prove the security properties in some of the existing threshold schemes.",

In this regard, we demonstrate that the currently best-known cryptanalytic result on $7$-round ChaCha with time $2^{189.7}$ and data $2^{102.63}$ [Xu et al., ToSC 2024] can be estimated as $2^{178.12}$ for time and $2^{101.09}$ for data complexity. We improve the best-known result for the $7.25$ round by obtaining an improved set of Probabilistic Neutral Bits and considering our revised estimation. Our result with time complexity $2^{212.43}$ and data complexity $2^{100.56}$ improves the result of Xu et al., where they could achieve time and data complexity $2^{223.9}$ and $2^{100.80}$, respectively. For both the $7$ and $7.25$ rounds, we can show an improvement of the order of $2^{11}$ in the time complexity. For $7.5$-round, we improve the result of Dey [IEEE-IT 2024], which reports the time and data complexity of $2^{255.24}$ and $2^{32.64}$, respectively. By applying the formula of the same paper and incorporating additional PNBs, we obtain improved time and data complexity of $2^{253.23}$ and $2^{34.47}$, respectively. Thus, this paper describes the currently best-known cryptanalytic results against reduced round ChaCha. Our results do not affect the security claims of the complete algorithm with 20 rounds. Also, we provide a rebuttal of the Work by Wang et al. \\cite{wangeprint} and analyze their claim about the error in the ``Divide-and-Conquer'' Approach.",

    "abstract": "Bootstrapping in approximate homomorphic encryption involves evaluating the modular reduction function. Traditional methods decompose the modular reduction function into three components: scaled cosine, double-angle formula, and inverse sine. While these approaches offer a strong trade-off between computational cost and level consumption, they lack flexibility in parameterization. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose a new method to decompose the modular reduction function with improved parameterization, generalizing prior trigonometric approaches. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method achieves near-optimal approximation errors. Additionally, we introduce a technique that integrates the rescaling operation into matrix operations during bootstrapping, further reducing computational overhead.",

    "abstract": "Anonymous tokens with private metadata bit (ATPM) have received increased interest as a method for anonymous client authentication while also embedding trust signals that are only readable by the authority who holds the issuance secret key and nobody else. A drawback of all existing ATPM constructions is that they require client-issuer interaction during the issuance process. In this work, we build the first non-interactive anonymous tokens (NIAT) with private metadata bit, inspired by the recent work of Hanzlik (Eurocrypt '23) on non-interactive blind signatures.  We discuss how the non-interaction property during the issuance process allows for more efficient issuance protocols that avoid the need for online signing. We construct an efficient NIAT scheme based   on Structure-preserving Signatures on Equivalence Classes (SPS-EQ) and experimentally evaluate its performance. We also present an extension to our NIAT construction that allows the identification of clients who attempt to double-spend (i.e., present the same token twice).",

    "abstract": "Non-malleable zero-knowledge (NMZK), originally  introduced in the seminal work of Dolev, Dwork, and Naor (STOC 91), is a fundamental concept for modeling the security of proof systems against man-in-the-middle attacks. \r\n\r\nRecently, Kim, Liang, and Pandey (CRYPTO 2022) presented the first efficient constant-round NMZK argument system based solely on symmetric-key cryptography. Their construction relies on a non-black-box use of the involved cryptographic primitives and on multiple executions of Ligero (CCS 2017) that affect both the round complexity and the computational efficiency of their protocol. Their work left open the natural important challenge of achieving NMZK using the underlying primitives only in a black-box fashion (regardless of the number of rounds and  actual efficiency).\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we solve the aforementioned open problem by presenting the first NMZK argument system based on the black-box use of cryptographic primitives. Our work is optimal in the use of primitives since we only need one-way functions, and asymptotically optimal in the number of rounds since we only require a constant number of rounds. Our argument system is non-malleable with respect to the strong \"simulation-extractability\" flavor of non-malleability. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, we also show that our construction can be efficiently instantiated in Minicrypt, significantly improving upon the work of Kim et al., both in terms of round complexity and  computational efficiency.",

Somehow, in this race of make and break, the stress on\r\nautomation of adopting such techniques on real-life circuits has\r\nbeen rather limited. For the first time, we present a generic\r\nend-to-end combinational logic locking CAD framework, MIDAS.\r\nThis framework analyses circuit netlists and generates locked\r\nnetlists. Due to its generic circuit analysis, it bridges the gap,\r\nintegrates diverse logic locking techniques, and offers a scope of\r\nintegration of potential future ones.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new type of non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK), called Fine-grained Verifier NIZK (FV-NIZK), which provides more flexible and more fine-grained verifiability of proofs than standard NIZK that supports public verifiability and  designated-verifier NIZK (DV-NIZK) that supports private verifiability. FV-NIZK has two statistically (or computationally) equivalent verification approaches: \r\n\r\n--- a master verification using the master secret key $msk$; \r\n\r\n--- a fine-grained verification using a derived secret key $sk_d$, which is derived from $msk$ w.r.t. $d$ (which may stand for user identity, email address, vector, etc.). \r\n\r\nWe require unbounded simulation soundness (USS) of FV-NIZK to hold, even if an adversary obtains derived secret keys $sk_d$ with $d$ of its choices, and  define proof pseudorandomness which stipulates the pseudorandomness of proofs for adversaries that are not given any secret key. \r\n\r\nWe present two instantiations of FV-NIZK for linear subspace languages, based on the matrix decisional Diffie-Hellman (MDDH) assumption. \r\nOne of the FV-NIZK instantiations is pairing-free and achieves almost tight USS and proof pseudorandomness. We also adapt the two instantiations to support unbounded fine-grained secret key delegations.\r\n\r\nWe illustrate the usefulness of FV-NIZK by showing two applications and obtain the following pairing-free schemes:\r\n\r\n--- the first almost tightly multi-challenge CCA (mCCA)-secure inner-product functional encryption (IPFE) scheme without pairings;\r\n\r\n--- the first public-key encryption (PKE) scheme that reconciles the inherent contradictions between public verifiability and anonymity. \r\nWe formalize such PKE as Fine-grained Verifiable PKE (FV-PKE), which derives a special key from the decryption secret key, such that for those who obtain the derived key, they can check the validity of ciphertexts but the anonymity is lost from their views (CCA-security still holds for them), while for others who do not get the derived key, they cannot do the validity check but the anonymity holds for them. \r\n\r\nOur FV-PKE scheme achieves almost tight mCCA-security for adversaries who obtain the derived keys, and achieves almost tight ciphertext pseudorandomness (thus anonymity) for others who do not get any derived key.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new one-more computational problem for lattice-based cryptography, which we refer to as the Algebraic One-More MISIS problem, or AOM-MISIS for short. It is a modification of the AOM-MLWE problem recently introduced by Espitau et al. (CRYPTO \u201924) to prove security of new two-round threshold signatures.\r\n\r\nOur first main result establishes that the hardness of AOM-MISIS is implied by the hardness of MSIS and MLWE (with suitable parameters), both of which are standard assumptions for efficient lattice-based cryptography. We prove this result via a new generalization of a technique by Tessaro and Zhu (EUROCRYPT \u201923) used to prove hardness of a one-more problem for linear hash functions assuming their collision resistance, for which no clear lattice analogue was known. Since the hardness of AOM-MISIS implies the hardness of AOM-MLWE, our result resolves the main open question from the work of Espitau et al., who only provided a similar result for AOM-MLWE restricted to selective adversaries, a class which does not cover the use for threshold signatures.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we show that our novel formulation of AOM-MISIS offers a better interface to develop tighter security bounds for state-of-the-art two-round threshold signatures. We exemplify this by providing new proofs of security, assuming the hardness of MLWE and MSIS, for two threshold signatures, the one proposed in the same work by Espitau et al., as well as a recent construction by Chairattana-Apirom et al. (ASIACRYPT 2024). For the former scheme, we also show that it satisfies the strongest security notion (TS-UF-4) in the security hierarchy of Bellare et al. (CRYPTO \u201922), as a result of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "ChaCha is a widely deployed stream cipher and one of the most important symmetric primitives. Due to this practical importance, many cryptanalysis have been proposed. Until now, Probabilistic Neutral Bits (PNBs) have been the most successful. Given differential-linear distinguishers, PNBs are the technique for key recovery relying on an experimental backward correlation obtained through blackbox analysis. A careful theoretical analysis exploiting the round function design may find a better attack and improve our understanding, but the complicated nature of the ARX structure makes such analysis difficult.  \r\n%\r\nWe propose a theoretical methodology inspired by bit puncturing, which was recently proposed at Eurocrypt 2024. Our method has a theoretical foundation and is thus fundamentally different from PNBs, to which it is the first effective alternative. As a result, we significantly improved the attack complexity for 6, 7, and 7.5-round ChaCha. The 7-round attack is about $2^{40}$ times faster than the previous best. Furthermore, we propose the first 7.5-round attack with a non-negligible advantage over an exhaustive search.",

    "abstract": "Presenting a novel use of encryption, not for hiding a secret, but for marking letters.  Given a 2n letters plaintext, the transmitter encrypts the first n letters with  key K1 to generate corresponding n cipherletters, and encrypts the second n letters with key K2 to generate n corresponding cipherletters. The transmitter sends the 2n cipherletters along with the keys, K1 and K2  The recipient (and any interceptor) will readily decrypt the 2n cipherletters to the original plaintext.  This makes the above procedure equivalent to sending out the plaintext.  So why bother?  When decrypting the 2n cipherletters one will make a note of how the letters that were encrypted with K1 are mixed with the letters encrypted with K2 while keeping the original order of the letters encrypted with each key. There are 2^n possible mixings. Which means that the choice of mixing order can deliver a secret message, S,  comprising n bits. So while on the surface a given plaintext is sent out from transmitter to recipient, this plaintext hides a secret.  Imagine a text messaging platform that uses this protocol. An adversary will not know which plain innocent message harbors a secret message.  This allows residents of cyberspace to communicate secrets without exposing the fact that they communicated a secret. Expect a big impact on the level of cyberspace privacy.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study preimage resistance of the SHA-3 standard. We propose a squeeze meet-in-the-middle attack as a new preimage attack method for the sponge functions. This attack combines the squeeze attack and meet-in-the-middle attack, and is implemented by internal differentials. We analyze the inverse operation of the SHA-3 round function, and develop a new target internal differential algorithm as well as a linearization technique for the Sbox in the backward phase. In addition, we propose the concept of a value-difference distribution table (VDDT) to optimize the attack complexity. These techniques lead to faster preimage attacks on five (out of six) SHA-3 functions reduced to 4 rounds, and also bring preimage attacks on 5 rounds of four SHA-3 instances. The attack techniques are verified by performing practical preimage attack on a small variant of 4-round Keccak.",

Our focus is on distinguishing problems related to the security of NIST round-4  McEliece-like cryptosystems, particularly for Goppa codes used in ClassicMcEliece and Quasi-Cyclic Moderate Density Parity-Check (QC-MDPC) codes used in BIKE. We present DeepDistinguisher, a new algorithm for distinguishing structured codes from random linear codes that uses a transformer. The results show that the new distinguisher achieves a high level of accuracy in distinguishing Goppa codes, suggesting that their structure may be more recognizable by AI models. Our approach outperforms traditional attacks in distinguishing Goppa codes in certain settings and does generalize to larger code lengths without further training using a puncturing technique. We also present the first distinguishing results dedicated to MDPC and QC-MDPC codes.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in cryptography is the construction of succinct garbling schemes that have asymptotically smaller size than Yao\u2019s garbled circuit construction. We present a new framework for succinct garbling that replaces the heavy machinery of most previous constructions by lighter-weight homomorphic secret sharing techniques.\r\n\r\nConcretely, we achieve 1-bit-per-gate (amortized) garbling size for Boolean circuits under circular variants of standard assumptions in composite-order or prime-order groups, as well as a lattice-based instantiation. We further extend these ideas to layered circuits, improving the per-gate cost below 1 bit, and to arithmetic circuits, eliminating the typical \u03a9(\u03bb)-factor overhead for garbling mod-p computations. Our constructions also feature \u201cleveled\u201d variants that remove circular-security requirements at the cost of adding a depth-dependent term to the garbling size.\r\n\r\nOur framework significantly extends a recent technique of Liu, Wang, Yang, and Yu (Eurocrypt 2025) for lattice-based succinct garbling, and opens new avenues toward practical succinct garbling. For moderately large circuits with a few million gates, our garbled circuits can be two orders of magnitude smaller than Yao-style garbling. While our garbling and evaluation algorithms are much slower, they are still practically feasible, unlike previous fully succinct garbling schemes that rely on expensive tools such as iO or a non-black-box combination of FHE and ABE. This trade-off\r\ncan make our framework appealing when a garbled circuit is used as a functional ciphertext that is broadcast or stored in multiple locations (e.g., on a blockchain), in which case communication and storage may dominate computational cost.",

    "abstract": "Practical signature-based witness encryption (SWE) schemes recently emerged as a viable alternative to instantiate timed-release cryptography in the honest majority setting. In particular, assuming threshold trust in a set of parties that release signatures at a specified time, one can ``encrypt to the future'' using an SWE scheme. Applications of SWE schemes include voting, auctions, distributed randomness beacons, and more. However, the lack of homomorphism in existing SWE schemes reduces efficiency and hinders deployment. In this work, we introduce the notion of homomorphic SWE (HSWE) to improve the practicality of timed-release encryption schemes. We show one can build HSWE using a pair of encryption and signature schemes where the uniqueness of the signature is required when the encryption scheme relies on injective one-way functions. We then build three HSWE schemes in various settings using BLS, RSA, and Rabin signatures and show how to achieve a privacy-preserving variant that only allows extracting the homomorphically aggregated result while keeping the individual plaintexts confidential",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art protocols that achieve constant-round secure multiparty computation currently present a trade-off: either consume an amount of communication that scales quadratically in the number of parties, or achieve better asymptotics at the cost of high constant factors (e.g. schemes based on LPN or DDH).\r\n \r\nWe construct a constant-round MPC protocol where communication scales linearly in the number of parties n. Our construction relies only on OT and RO, and it leverages packed secret sharing. Due to building on simple primitives, our protocol offers concrete improvement over asymptotically-efficient LPN-based schemes.  We consider security in the presence of a dishonest majority where the malicious (with abort) adversary corrupts an arbitrary constant fraction of parties. \r\n\r\nBy leveraging tri-state circuits (Heath et al. Crypto 2023), we extend our protocol to the RAM model of computation. For a RAM program that halts within $T$ steps, our maliciously-secure protocol communicates $O(n \\cdot T  \\log^3 T  \\log \\log T \\cdot \\kappa)$ total bits, where $\\kappa$ is a security parameter.",

    "abstract": "P  vs  NP  problem  is  the   most  important  unresolved  problem  in  the  field  of computational complexity. Its impact has penetrated into all aspects of algorithm design,  especially  in  the  field  of  cryptography.  The  security  of  cryptographic algorithms  based  on  short  keys  depends  on  whether  P  is  equal  to  NP.  In  fact, Shannon  strictly  proved  that  the  one-time-pad  system  meets  unconditional security, but because the one-time-pad system requires the length of key to be at least the length of plaintext, how to transfer the key is a troublesome problem that restricts the use of the one-time-pad system in practice. Cryptography algorithms used  in  practice  are  all  based  on  short  key,  and  the  security  of  the  short  key mechanism is ultimately based on one-way assumption. In fact, the existence of one-way function can directly lead to the important conclusion P\u2260NP.\r\nIn this paper, we originally constructed a short-key block cipher algorithm. The core feature of this algorithm is that for any block, when a plaintext-ciphertext pair is known, any key in the key space is valid, that is, for each block, the plaintext-ciphertext pair and the key are independence, and the independence between blocks is also easy to construct. This feature is completely different from all existing short-key cipher algorithms.\r\nBased on the above feature, we construct a problem and theoretically prove that the  problem  satisfies  the  properties  of  one-way  functions,  thereby  solving  the problem of the existence of one-way functions, that is, directly proving that P\u2260NP.",

    "abstract": "In verifiable secret sharing (VSS), a dealer shares a secret input among several parties, ensuring each share is verifiable. Motivated by its applications in the blockchain space, we focus on a VSS where parties holding shares are not allowed to reconstruct the dealer's secret (even partially) on their own terms, which we address as privacy-targeted collusion if attempted. \r\n\r\n    In this context, our work investigates mechanisms deterring such collusion in VSS among rational and malicious parties. For this problem, we make both algorithmic and combinatorial contributions:\r\n    1. We provide two collusion-deterrent mechanisms to discourage parties from colluding and recovering the dealer's secret. Notably, when it is desired to achieve fairness---where non-colluding parties are not at a loss---while allowing for the best achievable malicious fault tolerance, we define ``trackable access structures'' (TAS) and design a deterrence mechanism tailored for VSS on these structures. \r\n    2. We estimate the size of the optimal TAS, construct them from Steiner systems, provide highly robust TAS using partial Steiner systems, and present efficient secret sharing schemes for the latter close-to-optimal TAS for various parameter regimes.\r\n    3. We demonstrate that trackability in access structures is connected to combinatorial objects like (partial) Steiner systems, uniform subsets with restricted intersections, and appropriate binary codes. The robustness of access structures is equivalent to the minimum vertex cover of hypergraphs. \r\n\r\n    We believe these connections between cryptography, game theory, and discrete mathematics will be of broader interest.",

    "abstract": "We consider the question of protecting a general computation device, modeled by a stateful Boolean circuit, against leakage of partial information about its internal wires. Goyal et al. (FOCS 2016) obtained a solution for the case of bounded-communication leakage, where the wires are partitioned into two parts and the leakage can be any function computed using $t$ bits of communication between the parts. However, this solution suffers from two major limitations: (1) it only applies to a one-shot (stateless) computation, mapping an encoded input to an encoded output, and (2) the leakage-resilient circuit consumes fresh random bits, whose number scales linearly with the circuit complexity of the computed function.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we eliminate the first limitation and make progress on the second. Concretely:\r\n- We present the first construction of stateful circuits that offer information-theoretic protection against continuous bounded-communication leakage. As an application, we extend a two-party ``malware-resilient'' protocol of Goyal et al. to the continuous-leakage case. \r\n- For simple types of bounded-communication leakage, which leak $t$ parities or $t$ disjunctions of circuit wires or their negations, we obtain a deterministic variant that does not require any fresh randomness beyond the randomness in the initial state. Here we get computational security based on a subexponentially secure one-way function. This is the first deterministic leakage-resilient circuit construction for any nontrivial class of global leakage.",

    "abstract": "Matrix multiplication of two encrypted matrices (CC-MM) is a key challenge for privacy-preserving machine learning applications. As modern machine learning models focus on scalability, fast CC-MM on large datasets is increasingly in demand.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we present a CC-MM algorithm for large matrices. The algorithm consists of plaintext matrix multiplications (PP-MM) and ciphertext matrix transpose algorithms (C-MT). We propose a fast C-MT algorithm, which is computationally inexpensive compared to PP-MM. By leveraging high-performance BLAS libraries to optimize PP-MM, we implement large-scale CC-MM with substantial performance improvements. Furthermore, we propose lightweight algorithms, significantly reducing the key size from $1\\ 960$ MB to $1.57$ MB for CC-MM with comparable efficiency.\r\n\r\nIn a single-thread implementation, the C-MT algorithm takes $0.76$ seconds to transpose a $2\\ 048\\times 2\\ 048$ encrypted matrix. The CC-MM algorithm requires $85.2$ seconds to multiply two $4\\ 096\\times 4\\ 096$ encrypted matrices. For large matrices, our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art CC-MM method from Jiang-Kim-Lauter-Song [CCS'18] by a factor of over $800$.",

    "abstract": "Oblivious permutation (OP) enables two parties, a sender with a private data vector $x$ and a receiver with a private permutation \u03c0, to securely obtain the shares of \u03c0(x). OP has been used to construct many important MPC primitives and applications such as secret shuffle, oblivious sorting, private set operations, secure database analysis, and privacy-preserving machine learning. Due to its high complexity, OP has become a performance bottleneck in several practical applications, and many efforts have been devoted to enhancing its concrete efficiency. Chase et al. (Asiacrypt'20) proposed an offline-online OP paradigm leveraging a pre-computable resource termed Share Translation. While this paradigm significantly reduces online costs, the substantial offline cost of generating Share Translation remains an area for further investigation.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we redefine the pre-computable resource as a cryptographic primitive known as Correlated Oblivious Permutation (COP) and conduct in-depth analyses and optimizations of the two COP generation solutions: network-based solution and matrix-based solution. The optimizations for the network-based solution halve the communication/computation cost of constructing a switch (the basic unit of the permutation network) and reduce the number of switches in the permutation network. The optimizations for the matrix-based solution halve the communication cost of small-size COP generation and reduce the cost of large-size COP generation with in-outside permutation decomposition.\r\n\r\nWe implement our two COP generation protocols and conduct comprehensive evaluations. Taking commonly used 128-bit input data as an example, our network-based and matrix-based solutions are up to 1.7x and 1.6x faster than baseline protocols, respectively. \r\n We further facilitate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) PSU protocols with our optimized COP, achieving over 25% reduction in communication cost and 35% decrease in execution time. This shows that our COP optimizations bring significant improvements for real-world MPC primitives.",

    "abstract": "Cryptographic schemes often contain verification steps that are essential for security. Yet, faulty implementations missing these steps can easily go unnoticed, as the schemes might still function correctly. A prominent instance of such a verification step is the re-encryption check in the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform that plays a prominent role in the post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) considered in NIST's PQC standardization process. In KEMs built from FO, decapsulation performs a re-encryption check that is essential for security, but not for functionality. In other words, it will go unnoticed if this essential step is omitted or wrongly implemented, opening the door for key recovery attacks. Notably, such an implementation flaw was present in HQC's reference implementation and was only noticed after 19 months.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we develop a modified FO transform that binds re-encryption to functionality, ensuring that a faulty implementation which skips re-encryption will be exposed through basic correctness tests. We do so by adapting the \"verifiable verification\" methodology of Fischlin and G\u00fcnther (CCS 2023) to the context of FO-based KEMs. More concretely, by exporting an unpredictable confirmation code from the public key encryption and embedding it into the key derivation function, we can confirm that (most of) the re-encryption step was indeed performed during decapsulation. We formalize this concept, establish modified FO transforms, and prove how unpredictable PKE confirmation codes turn into noticeable correctness errors for faulty implementations. We show how to apply this technique to ML-KEM and HQC, both with negligible overhead, by leveraging the entropy lost through ciphertext compression or truncation. We confirm that our approach works through mathematical proofs, as well as experimental data. Our experiments show that the implementation flaw in HQC's reference implementation indeed makes basic test cases when following our approach.",

    "abstract": "We describe, formally model, and prove the security of Telegram's key exchange protocols for client-server communications. To achieve this, we develop a suitable multi-stage key exchange security model along with pseudocode descriptions of the Telegram protocols that are based on analysis of Telegram's specifications and client source code. We carefully document how our descriptions differ from reality and justify our modelling choices. Our security proofs reduce the security of the protocols to that of their cryptographic building blocks, but the subsequent analysis of those building blocks requires the introduction of a number of novel security assumptions, reflecting many design decisions made by Telegram that are suboptimal from the perspective of formal analysis. Along the way, we provide a proof of  IND-CCA security for the variant of RSA-OEAP+ used in Telegram and identify a hypothetical attack exploiting current Telegram server behaviour (which is not captured in our protocol descriptions). Finally, we reflect on the broader lessons about protocol design that can be taken from our work.",

    "abstract": "Presenting a protocol that builds a cryptographic solution which shifts security responsibility from the cipher designer to the cipher user.  The Polar Lattice is a pattern-devoid cryptographic cipher. It is based on a geometric construct -- a polar lattice, on which the letters of a plaintext alphabet A, are presented as two points each letter, so that to transmit a letter the transmitter transmits a randomized pathway, a trail, (ciphertext) that begins at the first point of the transmitted letter and ends at the second point of the transmitted letter; the transmitted pathway is a set of steps on the lattice. Once a letter is transmitted the next bits on the ciphertext mark the beginning of the pathway that points to the next letter. The size and the geometric construction of the polar lattice are randomized and kept secret. The randomized pathways may be long or short, the attacker does not know how to parcel the ciphertext to individual trails pointing to distinct letters in the plaintext alphabet A. The polar lattice may be implemented algebraically, or geometrically; the lattice may be a physical nano-construct. The polar lattice is very power efficient, very fast. It claims all the attributes associated with pattern devoid cryptography: it allows for only brute force cryptanalysis, which in turn can be defeated through increased ciphertext size, unlimited key size and structure complexity.",

    "abstract": "Privacy-preserving distributed computation enables a resource-limited client to securely delegate computations on sensitive data to multiple servers by distributing shares of the data.  In such systems, verifiable secret sharing (VSS) is a fundamental component, ensuring secure data distribution and directly impacting the overall performance. The most practical approach to construct VSS is through polynomial commitment (PC), with two main research directions to improve the VSS efficiency. The first focuses on improving the dealer time by designing PC that supports batch evaluation, i.e., generating multiple evaluation$\\&$proof pairs in one shot. The second  aims to reduce the broadcast cost by designing PC that supports batch opening, i.e., producing a compact proof for multiple evaluations. \r\n\r\nRecently, Zhang et al. (Usenix Security 2022) proposed a transparent PC that supports batch evaluation and obtained a transparent VSS with optimal dealer time. However, their scheme does not support batch opening, leading to high broadcast costs in VSS. To the best of our knowledge, no transparent PC currently supports both batch evaluation and batch opening, thus limiting the performance of existing VSS schemes.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose a transparent fully batchable polynomial commitment (TFB-PC), that simultaneously supports batch evaluation  and batch opening. Leveraging TFB-PC, we present a VSS scheme with optimal complexity: $O(n\\log n)$ dealer time, $O(n)$ participant time and $O(n)$ communication cost. Furthermore, we implement our VSS scheme and compare its performance with Zhang et al.\u2019s VSS\r\n(the naive approach). Results show that our scheme achieves $954\\text{-}27,595\\times$ reduction in communication cost and a $1,028\\text{-}1,155,106\\times$ speed up in participant time for $2^{11}$-$2^{21}$ parties.",

    "abstract": "Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is one of the most widely used and extensively studied encryption algorithms globally, which is renowned for its efficiency and robust resistance to attacks. In this paper, three quantum circuits are designed to implement the S-box, which is the sole nonlinear component in AES. By incorporating a linear key schedule, we achieve a quantum circuit for implementing AES with the minimum number of qubits used. As a consequence, only 264/328/398 qubits are needed to implement the quantum circuits for AES-128/192/256. Furthermore, through quantum circuits of the S-box and key schedule, the overall size of the quantum circuit required for Grover's algorithm to attack AES is significantly decreased. This enhancement improves both the security and resource efficiency of AES in a quantum computing environment.",

    "abstract": "Fault attacks pose a significant threat to cryptographic implementations, motivating the development of countermeasures, primarily based on a combination of redundancy and masking techniques. Redundancy, in these countermeasures, is often implemented via duplication or linear codes. However, their inherent structure remains susceptible to strategic fault injections bypassing error checks. To address this, the CAPA countermeasure from CRYPTO 2018 leveraged information-theoretic MAC tags for protection against fault and combined attacks. However, a recent attack has shown that CAPA can only protect against either side-channel analysis or fault attacks, but not both simultaneously, and with significant hardware costs. Its successor, M&M, improves efficiency but lacks protection against ineffective faults.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose StaMAC, a framework aimed at securely incorporating MAC tags against both side-channel and fault adversaries in a non-combined scenario. We extend the security notions outlined in StaTI from TCHES 2024, and propose the notion of MAC-stability, ensuring fault propagation in masked and MACed circuits, necessitating only a single error check at the end of the computation. Additionally, we show that the stability notion from StaTI is arbitrarily composable (whereas it was previously thought to be only serially composable), making it the first arbitrary composable fault security notion which does not require intermediate error checks or correction. Then, we establish the improved protection of masking combined with MAC tags compared to linear encoding techniques by showing bounds on the advantage considering several fault adversaries: a gate/register faulting adversary, an arbitrary register faulting adversary, and a random register faulting adversary. Then, we show how to transform any probing secure circuit to protect against fault attacks using the proposed MAC-stable gadgets implementing field operations. Finally, we demonstrate StaMAC on an AES implementation, evaluating its security and hardware costs compared to the countermeasures using MAC tags.",

The subpermutations are generated by a 5-cell cellular automaton based on a unique well-chosen rule and bijective affine transformations. In particular, the cellular automaton rule is chosen based on empirical tests of its ability to generate good pseudorandom output on a ring cellular automaton. Similarly, Feistel's network layout is based on empirical data regarding the quality of the output S-box.\r\n\r\nWe perform cryptanalysis of the generated 10-bit S-box: we test the properties of algebraic degree, algebraic complexity, nonlinearity, strict avalanche criterion, bit independence criterion, linear approximation probability, differential approximation probability, differential uniformity and boomerang uniformity of our S-box, and relate them to those of the AES S-box. We find security properties comparable to or sometimes even better than those of the standard AES S-box. We believe that our S-box could be used to replace the 5-bit substitution of ciphers like ASCON.",

    "abstract": "In this work we revisit the post-quantum security of KEM-based password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE), specifically that of (O)CAKE. So far, these schemes evaded a security proof considering quantum adversaries. We give a detailed analysis of why this is the case, determining the missing proof techniques. To this end, we first provide a proof of security in the post-quantum setting, up to a single gap. This proof already turns out to be technically involved, requiring advanced techniques to reason in the QROM, including the compressed oracle and the extractable QROM. To pave the way towards closing the gap, we then further identify an efficient simulator for the ideal cipher. This provides certain programming abilities as a necessary and sufficient condition to close the gap in the proof: we demonstrate that we can close the gap using the simulator, and give a meta-reduction based on KEM-anonymity that shows the impossibility of a non-programming reduction that covers a class of KEMs that includes Kyber / ML-KEM.",

    "abstract": "Generative models have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of applications. Training such models using proprietary data from multiple parties has been studied in the realm of federated learning. Yet recent studies showed that reconstruction of authentic training data can be achieved in such settings. \r\nOn the other hand, multiparty computation (MPC) guarantees standard data privacy, yet scales poorly for training generative models. \r\nIn this paper, we focus on improving reconstruction hardness during Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) training while keeping the training cost tractable. To this end, we explore two training protocols that use a public generator and an MPC discriminator: Protocol 1 (P1) uses a fully private discriminator, while Protocol 2 (P2) privatizes the first three discriminator layers. We prove reconstruction hardness for P1 and P2 by showing that (1) a public generator does not allow recovery of authentic training data, as long as the first two layers of the discriminator are private; and through an existing approximation hardness result on ReLU networks, (2) a discriminator with at least three private layers does not allow authentic data reconstruction with algorithms polynomial in network depth and size. We show empirically that compared with fully MPC training, P1 reduces the training time by $2\\times$ and P2 further by $4-16\\times$.",

    "abstract": "Shuffles are used in electronic voting in much the same way physical ballot boxes are used in paper systems: (encrypted) ballots are input into the shuffle and (encrypted) ballots are output in a random order, thereby breaking the link between voter identities and ballots. To guarantee that no ballots are added, omitted or altered, zero-knowledge proofs, called proofs of shuffle, are used to provide publicly verifiable transcripts that prove that the outputs are a re-encrypted permutation of the inputs. The most prominent proofs of shuffle, in practice, are those due to Terelius and\r\nWikstro\u0308m (TW), and Bayer and Groth (BG). TW is simpler whereas BG is more efficient, both in terms of bandwidth and computation. Security for the simpler (TW) proof of shuffle has already been machine-checked but several prominent vendors insist on using the more complicated BG proof of shuffle. Here, we machine-check the security of the Bayer-Groth proof of shuffle via the Coq proof-assistant. We then extract the verifier (software) required to check the transcripts produced by Bayer-Groth implementations and use it to check transcripts from the Swiss Post evoting\r\nsystem under development for national elections in Switzerland.",

    "abstract": "The key collision attack was proposed as an open problem in key-committing security in Authenticated Encryption (AE) schemes like $\\texttt{AES-GCM}$ and $\\texttt{ChaCha20Poly1305}$. In ASIACRYPT 2024, Taiyama et al. introduce a novel type of key collision\u2014target-plaintext key collision ($\\texttt{TPKC}$) for $\\texttt{AES}$. Depending on whether the plaintext is fixed, $\\texttt{TPKC}$ can be divided into $\\texttt{fixed-TPKC}$ and $\\texttt{free-TPKC}$, which can be directly converted into collision attacks and semi-free-start collision attacks on the Davies-Meyer ($\\texttt{DM}$) hashing mode. \r\n  In this paper, we propose a new rebound attack framework leveraging a time-memory tradeoff strategy, enabling practical key collision attacks with optimized complexity. We also present an improved automatic method for finding \\textit{rebound-friendly} differential characteristics by controlling the probabilities in the inbound and outbound phases, allowing the identified characteristics to be directly used in $\\textit{rebound-based}$ key collision attacks. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that the 2-round $\\texttt{AES-128}$ $\\texttt{fixed-TPKC}$ attack proposed by Taiyama et al. is a $\\texttt{free-TPKC}$ attack in fact, while $\\texttt{fixed-TPKC}$ attacks are considerably more challenging than $\\texttt{free-TPKC}$ attacks. By integrating our improved automatic method with a new rebound attack framework, we successfully identify a new differential characteristic for the 2-round $\\texttt{AES-128}$ $\\texttt{fixed-TPKC}$ attack and develope the first practical $\\texttt{fixed-TPKC}$ attack against 2-round $\\texttt{AES-128}$. Additionally, we present practical $\\texttt{fixed-TPKC}$ attacks against 5-round $\\texttt{AES-192}$ and 3-round $\\texttt{Kiasu-BC}$, along with a practical $\\texttt{free-TPKC}$ attack against 6-round $\\texttt{Kiasu-BC}$. Furthermore, we reduce time complexities for $\\texttt{free-TPKC}$ and $\\texttt{fixed-TPKC}$ attacks on other $\\texttt{AES}$ variants.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the deployment of Multi-Party Computation (MPC) in corporate data processing environments, focusing on its legal and technical implications under the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). By combining expertise in cryptography and legal analysis, we address critical questions necessary for assessing the suitability of MPC for real-world applications. Our legal evaluation explores the conditions under which MPC qualifies as an anonymizing approach under GDPR, emphasizing the architectural requirements, such as the distribution of control among compute parties, to minimize re-identification risks effectively. The assertions put forth in the legal opinion are validated by two distinct assessments conducted independently.\r\n\r\nWe systematically answer key regulatory questions, demonstrating that a structured legal assessment is indispensable for organizations aiming to adopt MPC while ensuring compliance with privacy laws. In addition, we complement this analysis with a practical implementation of privacy-preserving analytics using Carbyne Stack, a cloud-native open-source platform for scalable MPC applications, which integrates the MP-SPDZ framework as its backend. We benchmark SQL queries under various security models to evaluate scalability and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Poly1305 is a widely-deployed polynomial hash function. The rationale behind its design was laid out in a series of papers by Bernstein, the last of which dates back to 2005. As computer architectures evolved, some of its design features became less relevant, but implementers found new ways of exploiting these features to boost its performance. However, would we still converge to this same design if we started afresh with today's computer architectures and applications? To answer this question, we gather and systematize a body of knowledge concerning polynomial hash design and implementation that is spread across research papers, cryptographic libraries, and developers' blogs. We develop a framework to automate the validation and benchmarking of the ideas that we collect. This approach leads us to five new candidate designs for polynomial hash functions. Using our framework, we generate and evaluate different implementations and optimization strategies for each candidate. We obtain substantial improvements over Poly1305 in terms of security and performance. Besides laying out the rationale behind our new designs, our paper serves as a reference for efficiently implementing polynomial hash functions, including Poly1305.",

    "abstract": "In the interconnected global financial system, anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) regulations are indispensable for safeguarding financial integrity. However, while illicit transactions constitute only a small fraction of overall financial activities, traditional AML/CFT frameworks impose uniform compliance burdens on all users, resulting in inefficiencies, transaction delays, and privacy concerns. \r\nThese issues stem from the institution-centric model, where financial entities independently conduct compliance checks, resulting in repeated exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) and operational bottlenecks.\r\nTo address these challenges, we introduce \\textsf{zkAML}, a cryptographic framework that offers a novel approach to AML/CFT compliance. By leveraging zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) proofs, \\textsf{zkAML}~enables users to cryptographically demonstrate their regulatory compliance without revealing sensitive personal information. This approach eliminates redundant identity checks, streamlines compliance procedures, and enhances transaction efficiency while preserving user privacy.\r\nWe implement and evaluate \\textsf{zkAML}~on a blockchain network to demonstrate its practicality. Our experimental results show that \\textsf{zkAML}~achieves 55 transactions per second (TPS) on a public network and 324 TPS on a private network. The zk-SNARK proof generation times are $226.59$ms for senders and $215.76$ms for receivers, with a constant verification time of $1.47$ms per transaction. These findings highlight \\textsf{zkAML}'s potential as a privacy-preserving and regulation-compliant solution for modern financial systems.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the algebraic cryptanalysis of small-scale variants of the E0 stream cipher, a legacy cipher used in the Bluetooth protocol. By systematically reducing the size of the linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) while preserving the cipher\u2019s core structure, we investigate the relationship between the number of unknowns and the number of consecutive keystream bits required to recover the internal states of the LFSRs. Our work demonstrates an approximately linear relationship between the number of consecutive keystream bits and the size of small-scale E0 variants, as indicated by our experimental results. To this end, we utilize two approaches: the computation of Gr\u00f6bner bases using Magma\u2019s F4 algorithm and the application of CryptoMiniSat\u2019s SAT solver. Our experimental results show that increasing the number of keystream bits significantly improves computational efficiency, with the F4 algorithm achieving a speedup of up to 733\u00d7 when additional equations are supplied. Furthermore, we verify the non-existence of equations of degree four or lower for up to seven consecutive keystream bits, and the non-existence of equations of degree three or lower for up to eight consecutive keystream bits, extending prior results on the algebraic properties of E0.",

    "abstract": "We show that using a polynomial representation of prime field elements (PMNS) can be relevant for real-world cryptographic applications even in terms of performance. More specifically, we consider elliptic curves for cryptography when pseudo-Mersenne primes cannot be used to define the base field (e.g. Brainpool standardized curves, JubJub curves in the zkSNARK context, pairing-friendly curves). All these primitives make massive use of the Montgomery reduction algorithm and well-known libraries such as GMP or OpenSSL for base field arithmetic. We show how this arithmetic can be advantageously replaced by a polynomial representation of the number that can be easily parallelized, avoids carry propagation, and allows randomization process. We provide good PMNS basis in the cryptographic context mentioned above, together with a C-implementation that is competitive or faster than GMP and OpenSSL for performing basic operations in the base fields considered. We also integrate this arithmetic into the Rust reference implementation of elliptic curve scalar multiplication for Zero-knowledge applications, and achieve better practical performances for such protocols. This shows that PMNS is an attractive alternative for the base field arithmetic layer in cryptographic primitives using elliptic curves or pairings.",

    "abstract": "Efficient implementation of a pairing-based cryptosystem relies on high-performance arithmetic in finite fields $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ and their extensions $\\mathbb{F}_{p^k}$, where $k$ is the embedding degree. A small embedding degree is crucial because part of the arithmetic for pairing computation occurs in $\\mathbb{F}_{{p}^k}$ and includes operations such as squaring, multiplication, and Frobenius operations.\r\nIn this paper, we present a fast and efficient method for computing the Frobenius endomorphism and its complexity. Additionally, we introduce an improvement in the efficiency of cyclotomic cubing operations for several pairing-friendly elliptic curves, which are essential for the calculation of Tate pairing and its derivatives.",

    "abstract": "Chat groups in secure messaging applications such as Signal, Telegram, and Whatsapp are nowadays used for rapid and widespread dissemination of information to large groups of people. This is common even in sensitive contexts, associated with the organisation of protests, activist groups, and internal company dialogues. Manual administration of who has access to such groups quickly becomes infeasible, in the presence of hundreds or thousands of members.\r\n\r\nWe construct a practical, privacy-preserving reputation system, that automates the approval of new group members based on their reputation amongst the existing membership. We demonstrate security against malicious adversaries in a single-server model, with no further trust assumptions required. Furthermore, our protocol supports arbitrary reputation calculations while almost all group members are offline (as is likely). In addition, we demonstrate the practicality of the approach via an open-source implementation. For groups of size 50 (resp. 200), an admission process on a user that received 40 (resp. 80) scores requires 1312.2 KiB (resp. 5239.4 KiB) of communication, and 3.3s (resp. 16.3s) of overall computation on a single core. While our protocol design matches existing secure messaging applications, we believe it can have value in distributed reputation computation beyond this problem setting.",

    "abstract": "Deniable authentication allows Alice to authenticate a message to Bob, while retaining deniability towards third parties. In particular, not even Bob can convince a third party that Alice authenticated that message. Clearly, in this setting Bob should not be considered trustworthy. Furthermore, deniable authentication is necessary for deniable key exchange, as explicitly desired by Signal and off-the-record (OTR) messaging.\r\n\r\nIn this work we focus on (publicly verifiable) designated verifier signatures (DVS), which are a widely used primitive to achieve deniable authentication. We propose a definition of deniability against malicious verifiers for DVS. We give a construction that achieves this notion in the random oracle (RO) model. Moreover, we show that our notion is not achievable in the standard model with a concrete attack; thereby giving a non-contrived example of the RO heuristic failing.\r\n\r\nAll previous protocols that claim to achieve deniable authentication against malicious verifiers (like Signal's initial handshake protocols X3DH and PQXDH) rely on the Extended Knowledge of Diffie\u2013Hellman (EKDH) assumption. We show that this assumption is broken and that these protocols do not achieve deniability against malicious verifiers.",

    "abstract": "The Sum of Even-Mansour (SoEM) construction, proposed by Chen et al. at Crypto 2019,  has become the basis for designing some symmetric schemes, such as\r\n the nonce-based MAC scheme $\\text{nEHtM}_{p}$ and the nonce-based encryption scheme $\\text{CENCPP}^{\\ast}$.  In this paper, we make the first attempt to study the quantum security of SoEM under the Q1  model where the targeted encryption oracle can only respond to classical queries rather than quantum ones.\r\nFirstly, we propose a quantum key recovery attack on SoEM21 with a time complexity of $\\tilde{O}(2^{n/3})$ along with $O(2^{n/3})$ online classical queries. Compared with the current best classical result which requires $O(2^{2n/3})$, our method offers a quadratic  time  speedup while maintaining the same number of queries. The time complexity of our attack is less than that observed for quantum exhaustive search by a factor of $2^{n/6}$.  We further propose classical and quantum key recovery attacks on  the generalized SoEMs1 construction (consisting of $s\\geq 2$  independent public permutations), revealing that the application of quantum algorithms can provide a quadratic acceleration  over the pure classical methods. Our results also imply that the quantum security of SoEM21 cannot be strengthened merely by increasing  the number of permutations.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of cloud computing and data-driven applications has amplified privacy concerns, driven by the increasing demand to process sensitive data securely. Homomorphic encryption (HE) has become a vital solution for addressing these concerns by enabling computations on encrypted data without revealing its contents. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of two leading HE libraries, SEAL and OpenFHE, examining their performance, usability, and support for prominent HE schemes such as BGV and CKKS.   Our analysis highlights computational efficiency, memory usage, and scalability across Linux and Windows platforms, emphasizing their applicability in real-world scenarios. Results reveal that Linux outperforms Windows in computation efficiency, with OpenFHE emerging as the optimal choice across diverse cryptographic settings. This paper provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners to advance privacy-preserving applications using FHE.",

    "abstract": "The most fundamental performance metrics of secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocols are related to the number of messages the parties exchange (i.e., round complexity), the size of these messages (i.e., communication complexity), and the overall computational resources required to execute the protocol (i.e., computational complexity). Another quality metric of MPC protocols is related to the black-box or non-black-box use of the underlying cryptographic primitives. Indeed, the design of black-box MPC protocols, other than being of theoretical interest, usually can lead to protocols that have better computational complexity.\r\n   \r\n   In this work, we aim to optimize the round and communication complexity of black-box secure multi-party computation in the plain model, by designing a constant-round two-party computation protocol in the malicious setting, whose communication complexity is only polylogarithmic in the size of the function being evaluated. \r\n   We successfully design such a protocol, having only black-box access to fully homomorphic encryption, trapdoor permutations, and hash functions. To the best of our knowledge, our protocol is the first to make black-box use of standard cryptographic primitives while achieving almost asymptotically optimal communication and round complexity.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we revisit the question of key recovery using side-channel analysis for unrolled, single-cycle block ciphers. In particular, we study the Princev2 cipher. While it has been shown vulnerable in multiple previous studies, those studies were performed on side-channel friendly ASICs or older FPGAs (e.g., Xilinx Virtex II on the SASEBO-G board), and using mostly expensive equipment. We start with the goal of exploiting a cheap modern FPGA and board using power traces from a cheap oscilloscope. Particularly, we use Xilinx Artix 7 on the Chipwhisperer CW305 board and PicoScope 5000A, respectively.\r\n\r\nWe split our study into three parts. First, we show that the new set-up still exhibits easily detectable leakage, using a non-specific t-test. Second, we replicate attacks from older FPGAs. Namely, we start with the attack by Yli-M\u00e4yry et al., which is a simple chosen plaintext correlation power analysis attack using divide and conquer. However, we demonstrate that even this simple, powerful attack does not work, demonstrating a peculiar behavior. We study this behavior using a stochastic attack that attempts to extract the leakage model, and we show that models over a small part of the state are inconsistent and depend on more key bits than what is expected. We also attempt classical template attacks and get similar results.\r\n\r\nTo further exploit the leakage, we employ deep learning techniques and succeed in key recovery, albeit using a large number of traces. We perform the explainability technique called Key Guessing Occlusion (KGO) to detect which points the neural networks exploit. When we use these points as features for the classical template attack, although it did not recover the secret key, its performance improves compared to other feature selection techniques.",

    "abstract": "Shor's and Grover's algorithms' efficiency and the advancement of quantum computers imply that the cryptography used until now to protect one's privacy is potentially vulnerable to retrospective decryption, also known as harvest now, decrypt later attack in the near future. This dissertation proposes an overview of the cryptographic schemes used by Tor, highlighting the non-quantum-resistant ones and introducing theoretical performance assessment methods of a local Tor network. The measurement is divided into three phases. We will start with benchmarking a local Tor network simulation on constrained devices to isolate the time taken by classical cryptography processes. Secondly, the analysis incorporates existing benchmarks of quantum-secure algorithms and compares these performances on the devices. Lastly, the estimation of overhead is calculated by replacing the measured times of traditional cryptography with the times recorded for Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) execution within the specified Tor environment. By focusing on the replaceable cryptographic components, using theoretical estimations, and leveraging existing benchmarks, valuable insights into the potential impact of PQC can be obtained without needing to implement it fully.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a systematic study of module lattices. We extend the lattice enumeration algorithm from Euclidean lattices to module lattices, providing a generalized framework.  \r\nTo incorporate the refined analysis by Hanrot and Stehl\u00e8 (CRYPTO'07), we adapt key definitions from Euclidean lattices, such as HKZ-reduced bases and quasi-HKZ-reduced bases, adapting them to the pseudo-basis of modules.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, we revisit the lattice profile, a crucial aspect of enumeration algorithm analysis, and extend its analysis to module lattices.  \r\nAs a result, we improve the asymptotic performance of the module lattice enumeration algorithm and module-SVP.  \r\n\r\nFor instance, let $K = \\mathbb{Q}[x]/\\langle x^d + 1\\rangle$ be a number field with a power-of-two integer $d$, and suppose that $n\\ln n = o(\\ln d)$.  \r\nThen, the nonzero shortest vector in $M \\subset K^n$ can be found in time $d^{\\frac{d}{2e} + o(d)}$, improving upon the previous lattice enumeration bound of $(nd)^{\\frac{nd}{2e}+ o(nd)}$.  \r\n\r\nOur algorithm naturally extends to solving ideal-SVP. Given an ideal $I \\subset R$, where $R = \\mathbb{Z}[x]/\\langle x^t + 1 \\rangle$ with a power-of-two integer $t = nd$, we can find the nonzero shortest element of $I$ in time $\\exp(O(\\frac{t}{2e} \\ln \\ln t))$, improving upon the previous enumeration bound of $\\exp(O(\\frac{t}{2e} \\ln t))$.",

    "abstract": "Key Exchange mechanisms (KE or KEMs) such as the Diffie-Hellman protocol have proved to be a cornerstone conciliating the efficiency of symmetric encryption and the practicality of public key primitives. \r\n    Such designs however assume the non-compromission of the long term asymmetric key in use. To relax this strong security assumption, and allow for modern security features such as Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) or Post Compromise Security (PCS), Ratcheted-KE (RKE) have been proposed.\r\n    This work proposes to turn the Hamming Quasi-Cyclic (HQC) cryptosystem into such a Ratcheted-KE, yielding the first code-based such construction. \r\n    Interestingly, our design allows indifferently one party to update the key on-demand rather than the other, yielding a construction called bi-directional RKE, which compares favorably to generic transformations. \r\n    Finally, we prove that the resulting scheme satisfies the usual correctness and key-indistinguishability properties, and suggest concrete sets of parameters, assuming different real-life use cases.",

    "abstract": "A sequential aggregate signature scheme (SAS) allows multiple potential signers to sequentially aggregate their respective signatures into a single compact signature. Typically, verification of a SAS signatures requires access to all messages and public key pairs utilized in the aggregate generation. However, efficiency is crucial for cryptographic protocols to facilitate their practical implementation. To this end, we propose a sequential aggregate signature scheme with lazy verification for a set of user-message pairs, allowing the verification algorithm to operate without requiring access to all messages and public key pairs in the sequence. This construction is based on the RSA assumption in the random oracle model and is particularly beneficial in resource constrained applications that involve forwarding of authenticated information between parties, such as certificate chains. As an extension of this work, we introduce the notion of sequentially aggregatable proxy re-signatures that enables third parties or proxies to transform aggregatable signatures under one public key to another, useful in applications such as sharing web certificates and authentication of network paths. We also present a construction of a sequential aggregate proxy re-signature scheme, secure in the random oracle model, based on the RSA assumption, which may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "We show the first threshold blind signature scheme and threshold Oblivious PRF (OPRF) scheme which remain secure in the presence of an adaptive adversary, who can adaptively decide which parties to corrupt throughout the lifetime of the scheme.  Moreover, our adaptively secure schemes preserve the minimal round complexity and add only a small computational overhead over prior solutions that offered security only for a much less realistic static adversary, who must choose the subset of corrupted parties before initializing the protocol.\r\n\r\nOur threshold blind signature scheme computes standard BLS signatures while our threshold OPRF computes a very efficient \"2HashDH\" OPRF [JKK14].  We prove adaptive security of both schemes in the Algebraic Group Model (AGM).  Our adaptively secure threshold schemes are as practical as the underlying standard single-server BLS blind signature and 2HashDH OPRF, and they can be used to add cryptographic fault-tolerance and decentralize trust in any system that relies on blind signatures, like anonymous credentials and e-cash, or on OPRF, like the OPAQUE password authentication and the Privacy Pass anonymous authentication scheme, among many others.",

    "abstract": "Hardware obfuscation is an active trustworthy design technique targeting threats in the IC supply chain, such as IP piracy and overproduction. Recent research on Intellectual Property (IP) protection technologies suggests that using embedded reconfigurable components (e.g., eFPGA redaction) could be a promising approach to hide the functional and structural information of security-critical designs. However, such techniques suffer from almost prohibitive overhead in terms of area, power, delay, and testability. This paper proposes an obfuscation technique called EvoLUTe+, which is a unique and more fine-grained redaction approach using smaller reconfigurable components (e.g., Look-Up Tables (LUTs)). EvoLUTe+ achieves fine-grained partitioning, sub-circuit coloring, and scoring of IP, and then encrypts the original IP through the substitution of some sub-circuits. Different attacks are used to test the robustness of EvoLUTe+, including structural and machine learning attacks, as well as Bounded Model Checking (BMC) attacks. The overhead of the obfuscation design is also analyzed. Experimental results demonstrate that EvoLUTe+ exhibits robustness with acceptable overhead while resisting such threat models.",

    "abstract": "McEliece cryptosystems, based on code-based cryptography, is a candidate in Round 4 of NIST's post-quantum cryptography standardization process. The QC-MDPC (quasi-cyclic moderate-density parity-check) variant is particularly noteworthy due to its small key length. The Guo-Johansson-Stankovski (GJS) attack against the QC-MDPC McEliece cryptosystem was recently proposed and has intensively been studied. This attack reconstructs the secret key using information on decoding error rate (DER). However, in practice, obtaining complete DER information is presumed to be time-consuming. This paper proposes two algorithms to reconstruct the secret key under imperfection in the DER information and evaluates the relationship between the imperfection and efficiency of key reconstruction.

    "abstract": "One-shot signatures (OSS) were defined by Amos, Georgiou, Kiayias, and Zhandry (STOC'20). These allow for signing exactly one message, after which the signing key self-destructs, preventing a second message from ever being signed. While such an object is impossible classically, Amos et al observe that OSS may be possible using quantum signing keys by leveraging the no-cloning principle. OSS has since become an important conceptual tool with many applications in decentralized settings and for quantum cryptography with classical communication. OSS are also closely related to separations between classical-binding and collapse-binding for post-quantum hashing and commitments. Unfortunately, the only known OSS construction due to Amos et al. was only justified in a classical oracle model, and moreover their justification was ultimately found to contain a fatal bug. Thus, the existence of OSS, even in a classical idealized model, has remained open. \r\n\r\nWe give the first standard-model OSS, with provable security assuming (sub-exponential) indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) and LWE. This also gives the first standard-model separation between classical and collapse-binding post-quantum commitments/hashing, solving a decade-old open problem. Along the way, we also give the first construction with unconditional security relative to a classical oracle. To achieve our standard-model construction, we develop a notion of permutable pseudorandom permutations (permutable PRPs), and show how they are useful for translating oracle proofs involving random permutations into obfuscation-based proofs. In particular, obfuscating permutable PRPs gives a trapdoor one-way permutation that is $\\textit{full-domain}$, solving another decade-old-problem of constructing this object from (sub-exponential) iO and one-way functions.",

    "abstract": "Multi-party computation (MPC) has become increasingly practical in the last two decades, solving privacy and security issues in various domains, such as healthcare, finance, and machine learning. One big caveat is that MPC sometimes lacks usability since the knowledge barrier for regular users can be high. Users have to deal with, e.g., various CLI tools, private networks, and sometimes even must install many dependencies, which are often hardware-dependent.\r\n\r\nA solution to improve the usability of MPC is to build browser-based MPC engines where each party runs within a browser window. Two examples of such an MPC web engine are JIFF and the web variant of MPyC. Both support an honest majority with passive corruptions.\r\n\r\n$\\texttt{webSPDZ}$: Our work brings one of the most performant and versatile general-purpose MPC engines, MP-SPDZ, to the web. MP-SPDZ supports \u226540 MPC protocols with different security models, enabling many security models on the web. To port MP-SPDZ to the web, we use Emscripten to compile MP-SPDZ\u2019s C++ BackEnd to WebAssembly and upgrade the party communication for the browser (WebRTC or WebSockets). We call the new MPC web engine webSPDZ. As with the native versions of the mentioned MPC web engines, MPyC-Web and JIFF, webSPDZ outperforms them in our end-to-end experiments.\r\n\r\nWe believe that webSPDZ brings forth many interesting and practically relevant use cases. Thus, webSPDZ pushes the boundaries of practical MPC: making MPC more usable and enabling it for a broader community.",

    "abstract": "Black-box separations are a cornerstone of cryptography, indicating barriers to various goals. A recent line of work has explored black-box separations for quantum cryptographic primitives. Namely, a number of separations are known in the Common Haar Random State (CHRS) model, though this model is not considered a complete separation, but rather a starting point. A few very recent works have attempted to lift these separations to a unitary separation, which are considered complete separations. Unfortunately, we find significant errors in some of these lifting results.\r\n\r\nWe prove general conditions under which CHRS separations can be generically lifted, thereby giving simple, modular, and bug-free proofs of complete unitary separations between various quantum primitives. Our techniques allow for simpler proofs of existing separations as well as new separations that were previously only known in the CHRS model.",

    "abstract": "We revisit the problem of secure aggregation of high-dimensional vectors in a two-server system such as Prio. These systems are typically used to aggregate vectors such as gradients in private federated learning, where the aggregate itself is protected via noise addition to ensure differential privacy. Existing approaches require communication scaling with the dimensionality, and thus limit the dimensionality of vectors one can efficiently process in this setup.\r\n\r\nWe propose PREAMBLE: Private Efficient Aggregation Mechanism for  Block-sparse Euclidean Vectors. PREAMBLE is a novel extension of distributed point functions that enables communication- and computation-efficient aggregation of block-sparse vectors, which are sparse vectors where the non-zero entries occur in a small number of clusters of consecutive coordinates. We then show that PREAMBLE can be combined with random sampling and privacy amplification by sampling results, to allow asymptotically optimal privacy-utility trade-offs for vector aggregation, at a fraction of the communication cost. When coupled with recent advances in numerical privacy accounting, our approach incurs a negligible overhead in noise variance, compared to the Gaussian mechanism used with Prio.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of video streams as a primary medium for communication and the demand for high-quality video sharing over the internet have given rise to several security and privacy issues, such as unauthorized access and data breaches. To address these limitations, various Selective Video Encryption (SVE) schemes have been proposed, which encrypt specific portions of a video while leaving others unencrypted. The SVE approach balances security and usability, granting unauthorized users access to certain parts while encrypting sensitive content. However, existing SVE schemes adopt an all-or-nothing coarse-grain encryption approach, where a user with a decryption key can access all the contents of a given video stream. This paper proposes and designs a fine-grained access control-based selective video encryption scheme, ABSVE, and a use-case protocol called \\protocol. Our scheme encrypts different identified Regions of Interest (ROI) with a unique symmetric key and applies a Ciphertext Policy Attribute Based Encryption (CP-ABE) scheme to tie these keys to specific access policies. This method provides multiple access levels for a single encrypted video stream. Crucially, we provide a formal syntax and security definitions for ABSVE, allowing for rigorous security analysis of this and similar schemes --  which is absent in prior works. Finally, we provide an implementation and evaluation of our protocol in the Kvazaar HEVC encoder. Overall, our constructions enhance security and privacy while allowing controlled access to video content and achieve comparable efficiency to compression without encryption.",

    "abstract": "Hyperledger Fabric is a unique permissioned platform for implementing blockchain in a consortium. It has a distinct transaction flow of execute-order-validate. During the execution phase, a pre-determined set of endorsing peers execute a transaction and sign the transaction response. This process is termed endorsement. In the validation phase, peers validate the transaction with reference to an endorsement policy. The identity of the endorsing organizations is obtainable to all the nodes in the network through the endorser signature and endorsement policy. Knowing this has led to serious vulnerabilities in the blockchain network.\r\nIn this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving endorsement system which conceals both endorser signature and endorsement policy. Endorser is anonymized by replacing the signature scheme with a scoped-linkable threshold ring signature scheme. Endorsement policy is secured using Pedersen commitments and non-interactive proof of knowledge of integer vector. We also achieve efficiency in the computation by employing non-interactive proof of co-prime roots. We provide the necessary security analysis to prove that the proposed work guarantees anonymity and unlinkability properties. A comparative analysis of our work with an existing framework is provided which shows that the proposed scheme offers higher level of security and it is optimal in terms of efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The Chou-Orlandi batch oblivious transfer (OT) protocol is a particularly attractive OT protocol that bridges the gap between practical efficiency and strong security guarantees and is especially notable due to its simplicity. The security analysis provided by Chou and Orlandi bases the security of their protocol on the hardness of the computational Diffie-Hellman ($\\mathsf{CDH}$) problem in prime-order groups. Concretely, in groups in which no better-than-generic algorithms are known for the $\\mathsf{CDH}$ problem, their security analysis yields that an attacker running in time $t$ and issuing $q$ random-oracle queries breaks the security of their protocol with probability at most $\\epsilon \\leq q^2 \\cdot t / 2^{\\kappa/2}$, where $\\kappa$ is the bit-length of the group's order. This concrete bound, however, is somewhat insufficient for 256-bit groups (e.g., for $\\kappa = 256$, it does not provide any guarantee already for $t = 2^{48}$ and $q = 2^{40}$). \r\n\r\nIn this work, we establish a tighter concrete security bound for the Chou-Orlandi protocol. First, we introduce the list square Diffie-Hellman ($\\ell\\text{-}\\mathsf{sqDH}$) problem and present a tight reduction from the security of the protocol to the hardness of solving $\\ell\\text{-}\\mathsf{sqDH}$. That is, we completely shift the task of analyzing the concrete security of the protocol to that of analyzing the concrete hardness of the $\\ell\\text{-}\\mathsf{sqDH}$ problem. Second, we reduce the hardness of the $\\ell\\text{-}\\mathsf{sqDH}$ problem to that of the decisional Diffie-Hellman ($\\mathsf{DDH}$) problem without incurring a multiplicative loss. Our key observation is that although $\\mathsf{CDH}$ and $\\mathsf{DDH}$ have the same assumed concrete hardness, relying on the hardness of $\\mathsf{DDH}$ enables our reduction to efficiently test the correctness of the solutions it produces. \r\n\r\nConcretely, in groups in which no better-than-generic algorithms are known for the $\\mathsf{DDH}$ problem, our analysis yields that an attacker running in time $t$ and issuing $q \\leq t$ random-oracle queries breaks the security of the Chou-Orlandi protocol with probability at most $\\epsilon \\leq t / 2^{\\kappa/2}$ (i.e., we eliminate the above multiplicative $q^2$ term). We prove our results within the standard real-vs-ideal framework considering static corruptions by malicious adversaries, and provide a concrete security treatment by accounting for the statistical distance between a real-model execution and an ideal-model execution.",

    "abstract": "Side-channel vulnerabilities pose an increasing threat to cryptographically protected devices. Consequently, it is crucial to observe information leakages through physical parameters such as power consumption and electromagnetic (EM) radiation to reduce susceptibility during interactions with cryptographic functions. EM side-channel attacks are becoming more prevalent. PRESENT is a promising lightweight cryptographic algorithm expected to be incorporated into Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in the future. This research investigates the EM side-channel robustness of PRESENT using a correlation attack model. This work extends our previous Correlation EM Analysis (CEMA) of PRESENT with improved results. The attack targets the Substitution box (S-box) and can retrieve 8 bytes of the 10-byte encryption key with a minimum of 256 EM waveforms. This paper presents the process of EM attack modelling, encompassing both simple and correlation attacks, followed by a critical analysis.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Differential Fault Attacks (DFAs) have proven highly effective against stream ciphers designed for Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption (HHE). In this work, we present a table-based DFA framework called the \\textit{shortcut attack}, which generalizes the attack proposed by Wang and Tang on the cipher \\textsf{Elisabeth}. \r\nThe framework applies to a broad sub-family of ciphers following the Group Filter Permutator (GFP) paradigm and enhances previous DFAs by improving both the fault identification and path generation steps. Notably, the shortcut attack circumvents the issue of function representation, allowing successful attacks even when the cipher's filter function cannot be represented over the ring it is defined on.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we provide complexity estimates for the framework and apply the shortcut attack to \\textsf{Elisabeth-4} and its patches. As a result, we optimize the DFA on \\textsf{Elisabeth-4}, requiring fewer keystreams and running faster than previous methods. Specifically, we achieve a DFA that requires only $3000$ keystreams, which is one-fifth of the previous best result. We also successfully mount a practical DFA on \\textsf{Gabriel-4} and provide a theoretical DFA for \\textsf{Elisabeth-b4}.\r\n\r\nFor the latest patch, \\textsf{Margrethe-18-4}, which follows the more general Mixed Filter Permutator (MFP) paradigm, we present a DFA in a stronger model. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first DFA results on the patches of \\textsf{Elisabeth-4}. Finally, we derive security margins to prevent shortcut attacks on a broad sub-family of MFP ciphers, which can serve as parameter recommendations for designers.",

    "abstract": "Scloud+ is an unstructured LWE-based key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) with conservative quantum security, in which ternary secrets and lattice coding are incorporated for higher computational and communication efficiency. However, its efficiencies are still much inferior to those of the structured LWE-based KEM, like ML-KEM (standardized by NIST). In this paper, we present a configurable hardware architecture for Scloud+.KEM to improve the computational efficiency. Many algorithmic and architectural co-optimizations are proposed to reduce the complexity and increase the degree of parallelism. Specially, the matrix multiplications are computed by a block in serial and the block is calculated in one cycle, without using any multipliers. In addition, the random bits all are generated by an unfolded Keccak core, well matched with the data flow required by the block matrix multiplier. The proposed design is coded in Verilog and implemented under the SMIC 40nm LP CMOS technology. The synthesized results show that Scloud+.KEM-128 only costs 23.0 $us$, 24.3 $us$, and 24.6 $us$ in the KeyGen, Encaps, and Decaps stages, respectively, with an area consumption of 0.69 $mm^2$, significantly narrowing the gap with the state-of-the-art of Kyber hardware implementation.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we provide new theoretical and empirical evidences that gradient-based deep learning profiling attacks (DL-SCA) suffer from masking schemes. This occurs through an initial stall of the learning process: the so-called plateau effect. To understand why, we derive an analytical expression of a DL-SCA model targeting simulated traces which enables us to study an analytical expression of the loss. By studying the loss landscape of this model, we show that not only do the magnitudes of the gradients decrease as the order of masking increases, but the loss landscape also exhibits a prominent saddle point interfering with the optimization process. From these observations, we (1) propose the usage of a second-order optimization algorithm mitigating the impact of low-gradient areas. In addition, we show how to leverage the intrinsic sparsity of valuable information in SCA traces to better pose the DL-SCA problem. To do so, we (2) propose to use the implicit regularization properties of the sparse mirror descent. These propositions are gathered in a new publicly available optimization algorithm, Scoop. Scoop combines second-order derivative of the loss function in the optimization process, with a sparse stochastic mirror descent. We experimentally show that Scoop pushes further the current limitations of DL-SCA against simulated traces, and outperforms the state-of-the-art on the ASCADv1 dataset in terms of number of traces required to retrieve the key, perceived information and plateau length. Scoop also performs the first non-worst-case attack on the ASCADv2 dataset. On simulated traces, we show that using Scoop reduces the DL-SCA time complexity by the equivalent of one masking order.",

    "abstract": "Side-channel analysis (SCA) is a growing field in\r\nhardware security where adversaries extract secret information\r\nfrom embedded devices by measuring physical observables like\r\npower consumption and electromagnetic emanation. SCA is a\r\nsecurity assessment method used by governmental labs, standardization\r\nbodies, and researchers, where testing is not just\r\nlimited to standardized cryptographic circuits, but it is expanded\r\nto AI accelerators, Post Quantum circuits, systems, etc. Despite\r\nits importance, SCA is performed on an ad hoc basis in the\r\nsense that its flow is not systematically optimized and unified\r\namong labs. As a result, the current solutions do not account\r\nfor fair comparisons between analyses. Furthermore, neglecting\r\nthe need for interoperability between datasets and SCA metric\r\ncomputation increases students\u2019 barriers to entry. To address\r\nthis, we introduce SCAPEgoat, a Python-based SCA library\r\nwith three key modules devoted to defining file format, capturing\r\ninterfaces, and metric calculation. The custom file framework\r\norganizes side-channel traces using JSON for metadata, offering\r\na hierarchical structure similar to HDF5 commonly applied in\r\nSCA, but more flexible and human-readable. The metadata can\r\nbe queried with regular expressions, a feature unavailable in\r\nHDF5. Secondly, we incorporate memory-efficient SCA metric\r\ncomputations, which allow using our functions on resource-restricted\r\nmachines. This is accomplished by partitioning datasets\r\nand leveraging statistics-based optimizations on the metrics. In\r\ndoing so, SCAPEgoat makes the SCA more accessible to newcomers\r\nso that they can learn techniques and conduct experiments\r\nfaster and with the possibility to expand on in the future.",

    "abstract": "DNA edit distance (ED) measures the minimum number of single nucleotide insertions, substitutions, or deletions required to convert a DNA sequence into another. ED has broad applications in healthcare such as sequence alignment, genome assembly, functional annotation, and drug discovery. Privacy-preserving computation is essential in this context to protect sensitive genomic data. Nonetheless, the existing secure DNA edit distance solutions lack efficiency when handling large data sequences or resort to approximations and fail to accurately compute the metric.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we introduce secureED, a protocol that tackles these limitations, resulting in a significant performance enhancement of approximately $2-24\\times$ compared to existing methods. Our protocol computes a secure ED between two genomes, each comprising $1,000$ letters, in just a few seconds. The underlying technique of our protocol is a novel approach that transforms the established approximate matching technique (i.e., the Ukkonen algorithm) into exact matching, exploiting the inherent similarity in human DNA to achieve cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, we introduce various optimizations tailored for secure computation in scenarios with a limited input domain, such as DNA sequences composed solely of the four nucleotide letters.",

    "abstract": "Due to their simple security assessments, permutation-based pseudo-random functions (PRFs) have become widely used in cryptography. It has been shown that PRFs using a single $n$-bit permutation achieve $n/2$ bits of security, while those using two permutation calls provide $2n/3$ bits of security in the classical setting. This paper studies the security of permutation-based PRFs within the Q1 model, where attackers are restricted to classical queries and offline quantum computations. We present improved quantum-time/classical-data tradeoffs compared with the previous attacks. Specifically, under the same assumptions/hardware as Grover's exhaustive search attack, i.e. the offline Simon algorithm, we can recover keys in quantum time $\\tilde{O}(2^{n/3})$, with $O(2^{n/3})$ classical queries and $O(n^2)$ qubits. Furthermore, we enhance previous superposition attacks by reducing the data complexity from exponential to polynomial, while maintaining the same time complexity. This implies that permutation-based PRFs become vulnerable when adversaries have access to quantum computing resources. It is pointed out that the above quantum attack can be used to quite a few cryptography, including PDMMAC and pEDM, as well as general instantiations like XopEM, EDMEM, EDMDEM, and others.",

    "abstract": "Registration-based encryption (RBE) is a recently developed alternative to identity-based encryption, that mitigates the well-known key-escrow problem by letting each user sample its own key pair. In RBE, the key authority is substituted by a key curator, a completely transparent entity whose only job is to reliably aggregate users' keys. However, one limitation of all known RBE scheme is that they all rely on one-time trusted setup, that must be computed honestly. \r\n    \r\n    In this work, we ask whether this limitation is indeed inherent and we initiate the systematic study of RBE in the plain model, without any common reference string. We present the following main results:\r\n        - (Definitions) We show that the standard security definition of RBE is unachievable without a trusted setup and we propose a slight weakening, where one honest user is required to be registered in the system.\r\n        - (Constructions) We present constructions of RBE in the plain model, based on standard cryptographic assumptions. Along the way, we introduce the notions of non-interactive witness indistinguishable (NIWI) proofs secure against chosen statements attack and re-randomizable RBE, which may be of independent interest.\r\n        A major limitation of our constructions, is that users must be updated upon every new registration. \r\n        - (Lower Bounds) We show that this limitation is in some sense inherent. We prove that any RBE in the plain model that satisfies a certain structural requirement, which holds for all known RBE constructions, must update all but a vanishing fraction of the users, upon each new registration. This is in contrast with the standard RBE settings, where users receive a logarithmic amount of updates throughout the lifetime of the system.",

    "abstract": "This work introduce a new approach called Max bias analysis for the entropy computation of structures of Free Ring Oscillator-based Physical Random Number Generator. It employs the stochastic model based on the well-established Wiener process, specifically adapted to only capture thermal noise contributions while accounting for potential non-zero bias in the duty cycle.\r\nOur analysis is versatile, applicable to combinations of multiple sampled Ring Oscillator (RO) filtering by any function. The entropy computation takes as inputs the parameters of the thermal stochastic model and delivers directly a proven bound for both Shannon entropy and min-entropy to fulfill AIS31 and NIST SP 800-90 B. As an example, we apply the new methodology on an enhanced structure of TRNG combining several free-running Ring Oscillators filtered by a vectorial function built from a linear error correcting code that optimizes the functional performance in terms of [entropy rate/silicium area used] and that maintains the mathematical proof of the entropy lower bound as simple as possible.",

    "abstract": "We describe a strategy for a nation to acquire majority stake in Bitcoin with zero cost to the taxpayers of the nation. We propose a bitcoin fork sponsored by the the government of the nation, and backed by the full faith of treasury of the nation, such that the genesis block of this fork attributes fixed large amount of new kinds of tokens called strategic-reserve-bitcoin tokens (SRBTC) to the nation's treasury, which is some  multiple (greater than one) of the amount of all Bitcoin tokens (BTC) currently set in the Bitcoin protocol. The BTC tokens continue to be treated 1:1 as SRBTC tokens in the forked chain. The only capital that the nation puts up is its explicit guarantee that the SRBTC tokens of the fork will be accepted as legal tender, such as payment of tax to the treasury.\r\n\r\nWe suggest that this is a better approach than starting a new blockchain that mimics Bitcoin, as it will be  partially fair to the current holders of Bitcoin, which in turn would make it competitive in the space of other such possible forks by other powerful nations. Moreover, such a proof-of-work blockchain  retains its egalitarian and democratic nature, which competitively deters the said nation from any dilutions in the future. \r\n\r\nTo justify our proposal we setup three competitive games, and show strategies for different players that are in Nash equilibrium and which throw further light on these claims. In particular, \r\n\r\n1. The first game shows that if the only two alternatives for investors is to invest in BTC or SRBTC, then individuals who have a certain fraction $\\theta$ of their wealth already invested in BTC, will invest new money in the original chain, whereas the individuals whose current wealth invested in BTC is less than the $\\theta$ fraction will invest new money in SRBTC.\r\n2. The second game shows that if there is a third alternative for investment, which is cash that is losing value (inflation-adjusted) by a percentage $d$, then the investors who had less than $\\theta$ fraction of wealth in Bitcoin, will invest in SRBTC only if the dilution of SRBTC is large enough (as an increasing (linear) function of $1/d$). Here by dilution we mean the new SRBTC tokens that are allowed to be eventually mined in the fork.\r\n3.  The third game shows that investors would prefer a fork of Bitcoin over a replica of Bitcoin that doesn't value original BTC, when both are available and even if both are backed similarly by one or more nations.",

In this paper, we introduce a Systemization of Knowledge of the Estonian IVXV i-voting system and propose some added security enhancements. The presented SoK includes applications implemented by election observers in 2023 & 2024 elections, which, to our knowledge, has never been mentioned and/or analyzed in the academic literature before. The paper also updates the general knowledge about an extra right given to auditors \r\n(but not observers) in the June 2024 European election, recent complaints, and about newer solutions suggested by academia in 2024. Finally, we discuss the current system status in 2024 EP elections and propose our own suggestions to some problems stated in the OSCE-ODIHR 2023 report that are still there.",

    "abstract": "Zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs have been recently explored for the integrity of machine learning (ML) inference. However, these protocols suffer from high computational overhead, with the primary bottleneck stemming from the evaluation of non-linear functions. In this paper, we propose the first systematic ZK proof framework for non-linear mathematical functions in ML using the perspective of table lookup. The key challenge is that table lookup cannot be directly applied to non-linear functions in ML since it would suffer from inefficiencies due to the intolerably large table. Therefore, we carefully design several important building blocks, including digital decomposition, comparison, and truncation, such that they can effectively utilize table lookup with a quite small table size while ensuring the soundness of proofs. Based on these blocks, we implement complex mathematical operations and further construct ZK proofs for current mainstream non-linear functions in ML such as ReLU, sigmoid, and normalization. The extensive experimental evaluation shows that our framework achieves 50 \u223c 179\u00d7 runtime improvement compared to the state-of-the-art work, while maintaining a similar level of communication efficiency.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we study the communication complexity of constant-round secure multiparty computation (MPC) against a fully malicious adversary and consider both the honest majority setting and the dishonest majority setting. In the (strong) honest majority setting (where $t=(1/2-\\epsilon)n$ for a constant $\\epsilon$), the best-known result without relying on FHE is given by Beck et al. (CCS 2023) based on the LPN assumption that achieves $O(|C|\\kappa)$ communication, where $\\kappa$ is the security parameter and the achieved communication complexity is independent of the number of participants. In the dishonest majority setting, the best-known result is achieved by Goyal et al. (ASIACRYPT 2024), which requires $O(|C|n\\kappa)$ bits of communication and is based on the DDH and LPN assumptions.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we achieve the following results: (1) For any constant $\\epsilon<1$, we give the first constant-round MPC in the dishonest majority setting for corruption threshold $t<(1-\\epsilon)n$ with $O(|C|\\kappa+D (n+\\kappa)^2\\kappa)$ communication assuming random oracles and oblivious transfers, where $D$ is the circuit depth. (2) We give the first constant-round MPC in the standard honest majority setting (where $t=(n-1)/2$) with $O(|C|\\kappa+D (n+\\kappa)^2\\kappa)$ communication only assuming random oracles. \r\n\r\nUnlike most of the previous constructions of constant-round MPCs that are based on multiparty garbling, we achieve our result by letting each party garble his local computation in a non-constant-round MPC that meets certain requirements. We first design a constant-round MPC that achieves $O(|C|\\kappa + Dn^2\\kappa)$ communication assuming random oracles in the strong honest majority setting of $t=n/4$. Then, we combine the party virtualization technique and the idea of MPC-in-the-head to boost the corruption threshold to $t<(1-\\epsilon)n$ for any constant $\\epsilon<1$ assuming oblivious transfers to achieve our first result. Finally, our second result is obtained by instantiating oblivious transfers using a general honest-majority MPC and the OT extension technique built on random oracles.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has recently emerged as one of the leading paradigms for collaborative machine learning, serving as a tool for model computation without a need to expose one\u2019s privately stored data. However, despite its advantages, FL systems face severe challenges within its own security solutions that address both privacy and robustness of models. This paper focuses on vulnerabilities within the domain of FL security with emphasis on model-robustness. Identifying critical gaps in current defences, particularly against adaptive adversaries which modify their attack strategies after being disconnected and rejoin systems to continue attacks. To our knowledge, other surveys in this domain do not cover the concept of adaptive adversaries, this along with the significance of their impact serves as the main motivation for this work. Our contributions are fivefold: (1) we present a comprehensive overview of FL systems, presenting a complete summary of its fundamental building blocks, (2) an extensive overview of existing vulnerabilities that target FL systems in general, (3) highlight baseline attack vectors as well as state-of-the-art approaches to development of attack methods and defence mechanisms, (4) introduces a novel baseline method of attack leveraging reconnecting malicious clients, and (5) identifies future research directions to address and counter adaptive attacks. We demonstrate through experimental results that existing baseline secure aggregation rules used in other works for comparison such as Krum and Trimmed Mean are insufficient against those attacks. Further, works improving upon those algorithms do not address this concern either. Our findings serve as a basis for redefining FL security paradigms in the direction of adaptive adversaries.",

    "abstract": "Single Sign-On (SSO) is a popular authentication mechanism enabling users to access multiple web services with a single set of credentials. Despite its convenience, SSO faces outstanding privacy challenges. The Identity Provider (IdP) represents a single point of failure and can track users across different Relying Parties (RPs). Multiple colluding RPs may track users through common identity attributes. In response, anonymous credential-based SSO solutions have emerged to offer privacy-preserving authentication without revealing unnecessary user information. However, these solutions face two key challenges: supporting RP authentication without compromising user unlinkability and maintaining compatibility with the predominant Authorization Code Flow (ACF).\r\n\r\nThis paper introduces VeriSSO, a novel SSO protocol based on verifiable credentials (VC) that supports RP authentication while preserving privacy and avoiding single points of failure. VeriSSO employs an independent authentication server committee to manage RP and user authentication, binding RP authentication with credential-based anonymous user authentication. This approach ensures user unlinkability while supporting RP authentication and allows RPs to continue using their existing verification routines with identity tokens as in the ACF workflow. VeriSSO's design also supports lawful de-anonymization, ensuring user accountability for misbehavior during anonymity. Experimental evaluations of VeriSSO demonstrate its efficiency and practicality, with authentication processes completed within 100 milliseconds.",

    "abstract": "The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) delivers both confidentiality and integrity yet poses performance and security challenges on resource-limited microcontrollers. In this paper, we present an optimized AES-GCM implementation for the ARM Cortex-M4 that combines Fixslicing AES with the FACE (Fast AES-CTR Encryption) strategy, significantly reducing redundant computations in AES-CTR. We further examine two GHASH implementations\u2014a 4-bit Table-based approach and a Karatsuba-based constant-time variant\u2014to balance speed, memory usage, and resistance to timing attacks. Our evaluations on an STM32F4 microcontroller show that Fixslicing+FACE reduces AES-128 GCTR cycle counts by up to 19.41\\%, while the Table-based GHASH achieves nearly double the speed of its Karatsuba counterpart. These results confirm that, with the right mix of bitslicing optimizations, counter-mode caching, and lightweight polynomial multiplication, secure and efficient AES-GCM can be attained even on low-power embedded devices.",

    "abstract": "This paper formalizes the notion of server-aided anonymous credentials (SAACs), a new model for anonymous credentials (ACs) where, in the process of showing a credential, the holder is helped by additional auxiliary information generated in an earlier (anonymous) interaction with the issuer. This model enables lightweight instantiations of 'publicly verifiable and multi-use' ACs from pairing-free elliptic curves, which is important for compliance with existing national standards. A recent candidate for the EU Digital Identity Wallet, BBS#, roughly adheres to the SAAC model we have developed; however, it lacks formal security definitions and proofs.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we provide rigorous definitions of security for SAACs, and show how to realize SAACs from the weaker notion of keyed-verification ACs (KVACs) and special types of oblivious issuance protocols for zero-knowledge proofs. We instantiate this paradigm to obtain two constructions: one achieves statistical anonymity with unforgeability under the Gap $q$-SDH assumption, and the other achieves computational anonymity and unforgeability under the DDH assumption.",

    "abstract": "We present a unifying framework for proving the knowledge-soundness of KZG-like polynomial commitment schemes, encompassing both univariate and multivariate variants. By conceptualizing the proof technique of Lipmaa, Parisella, and Siim for the univariate KZG scheme (EUROCRYPT 2024), we present tools and falsifiable hardness assumptions that permit black-box extraction of the multivariate KZG scheme. Central to our approach is the notion of a canonical Proof-of-Knowledge of a Polynomial (PoKoP) of a polynomial commitment scheme, which we use to capture the extractability notion required in constructions of practical zk-SNARKs. We further present an explicit polynomial decomposition lemma for multivariate polynomials, enabling a more direct analysis of interpolating extractors and bridging the gap between univariate and multivariate commitments. Our results provide the first standard-model proofs of extractability for the multivariate KZG scheme and many of its variants under falsifiable assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Sigma protocols ($\\Sigma$-protocols) provide a foundational paradigm for constructing secure algorithms in privacy-preserving applications. To enhance efficiency, several extended models [BG18], [BBB+18], [AC20] incorporating various optimization techniques have been proposed as ``replacements'' for the original $\\Sigma$-protocol. However, these models often lack the expressiveness needed to handle complex relations and hinder designers from applying appropriate instantiation and optimization strategies.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel compressed $\\Sigma$-protocol model that effectively addresses these limitations by providing concrete constructions for relations involving non-linear constraints. Our approach is sufficiently expressive to encompass a wide range of relations. Central to our model is the definition of doubly folded commitments, which, along with a proposed Argument of Knowledge, generalizes the compression and amortization processes found in previous models. Despite the ability to express more relations, this innovation also provides a foundation to discuss a general aggregation technique, optimizing the proof size of instantiated schemes. \r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the above statements, we provide a brief review of several existing protocols that can be instantiated using our model to demonstrate the versatility of our construction. We also present use cases where our generalized model enhances applications traditionally considered ``less compact'', such as binary proofs [BCC+15] and $k$-out-of-$n$ proofs [ACF21]. In conclusion, our new model offers a more efficient and expressive alternative to the current use of $\\Sigma$-protocols, paving the way for broader applicability and optimization in cryptographic applications.",

    "abstract": "Group actions have emerged as a powerful framework in post-quantum cryptography, serving as the foundation for various cryptographic primitives. The Lattice Isomorphism Problem (LIP) has recently gained attention as a promising hardness assumption for designing quantum-resistant protocols. Its formulation as a group action has opened the door to new cryptographic applications, including a commitment scheme and a linkable ring signatures.\r\nIn this work, we analyze the security properties of the LIP group action and present new findings. Specifically, we demonstrate that it fails to satisfy the weak unpredictability and weak pseudorandomness properties when the adversary has access to as few as three and two instances with the same secret, respectively. This significantly improves upon prior analysis by Budroni et al. (PQCrypto 2024).\r\nAs a direct consequence of our findings, we reveal a vulnerability in the linkable ring signature scheme proposed by Khuc et al. (SPACE 2024), demonstrating that the hardness assumption underlying the linkable anonymity property does not hold.",

    "abstract": "We revisit the question of minimizing the proof length of designated-verifier succinct non-interactive arguments (dv-SNARGs) in the generic group model. Barta et al. (Crypto 2020) constructed such dv-SNARGs with inverse-polynomial soundness in which the proof consists of only two group elements. For negligible soundness, all previous constructions required a super-constant number of group elements.\r\n\r\n    We show that one group element suffices for negligible soundness. Concretely, we obtain dv-SNARGs (in fact, dv-SNARKs) with $2^{-\\tau}$ soundness where proofs consist of one element of a generic group $\\mathbb G$ and $O(\\tau)$ additional bits. In particular, the proof length in group elements is constant even with $1/|\\mathbb G|$ soundness error. \r\n    \r\n    In more concrete terms, compared to the best known SNARGs using bilinear groups, we get dv-SNARGs with roughly $2$x shorter proofs (with $2^{-80}$ soundness at a $128$-bit security level). We are not aware of any practically feasible proof systems that achieve similar succinctness, even fully interactive or heuristic ones. \r\n\r\n    Our technical approach is based on a novel combination of techniques for trapdoor hash functions and group-based homomorphic secret sharing with linear multi-prover interactive proofs.",

    "abstract": "A secret-sharing scheme is a method by which a dealer distributes shares to parties such that only authorized subsets of parties can reconstruct the secret. Secret-sharing schemes are an important tool in cryptography and they are used as a building block in many secure protocols, e.g., secure multiparty computation protocols for arbitrary functionalities, Byzantine agreement, threshold cryptography, access control, attribute-based encryption, and weighted cryptography (e.g., stake-based blockchains). The collection of authorized sets that should be able to reconstruct the secret is called an access structure. The main goal in secret sharing is to minimize the share size in a scheme realizing an access structure. In most of this monograph, we will consider secret-sharing schemes with information-theoretic security, i.e., schemes in which unauthorized sets cannot deduce any information on the secret even when the set has unbounded computational power. Although research on secret-sharing schemes has been conducted for nearly 40 years, we still do not know what the optimal share size required to realize an arbitrary \ud835\udc5b-party access structure is; there is an exponential gap between the best known upper bounds and the best known lower bounds on the share size.\r\n\r\nIn this monograph, we review the most important topics on secret sharing. We start by discussing threshold secret-sharing schemes in which the authorized sets are all sets whose size is at least some threshold \ud835\udc61; these are the most useful secret-sharing schemes. We then describe efficient constructions of secret-sharing schemes for general access structures; in particular, we describe constructions of linear secret-sharing schemes from monotone formulas and monotone span programs and provide a simple construction for arbitrary \ud835\udc5b-party access structures with share size 2\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b for some constant \ud835\udc50 < 1. To demonstrate the importance of secret-sharing schemes, we show how they are used to construct secure multi-party computation protocols for arbitrary functions. We next discuss the main problem with known secret-sharing schemes \u2013 the large share size, which is exponential in the number of parties. We present the known lower bounds on the share size. These lower bounds are fairly weak, and there is a big gap between the lower and upper bounds. For linear secret-sharing schemes, which are a class of schemes based on linear algebra that contains most known schemes, exponential lower bounds on the share size are known. We then turn to study ideal secret-sharing schemes in which the share size of each party is the same as the size of the secret; these schemes are the most efficient secret-sharing schemes. We describe a characterization of the access structures that have ideal schemes via matroids. Finally, we discuss computational secret-sharing schemes, i.e., secret-sharing schemes that are secure only against polynomial-time adversaries. We show computational schemes for monotone and non-monotone circuits; these constructions are more efficient than the best known schemes with information-theoretic security.",

    "abstract": "Efficiently protecting embedded software implementations of standard symmetric cryptographic primitives against side-channel attacks has been shown to be a considerable challenge in practice. This is, in part, due to the most natural countermeasure for such ciphers, namely Boolean masking, not amplifying security well in the absence of sufficient physical noise in the measurements. So-called prime-field masking has been demonstrated to provide improved theoretical guarantees in this context, and the Feistel for Prime Masking (FPM) family of Tweakable Block Ciphers (TBCs) has been recently introduced (Eurocrypt\u201924) to efficiently leverage these advantages. However, it was so far only instantiated for and empirically evaluated in a hardware implementation context, by using a small (7-bit) prime modulus. In this paper, we build on the theoretical incentive to increase the field size to obtain improved side-channel (Eurocrypt\u201924) and fault resistance (CHES\u201924), as well as on the practical incentive to instantiate an FPM instance with optimized performance on 32-bit software platforms. We introduce mid-pSquare for this purpose, a lightweight TBC operating over a 31-bit Mersenne prime field. We first provide an in-depth black box security analysis with a particular focus on algebraic attacks \u2013 which, contrary to the cryptanalysis of instances over smaller primes, are more powerful than statistical ones in our setting. We also design a strong tweak schedule to account for potential related-tweak algebraic attacks which, so far, are almost unknown in the literature. We then demonstrate that mid-pSquare implementations deliver very competitive performance results on the target platform compared to analogous binary TBCs regardless of masked or unmasked implementation (we use fix-sliced SKINNY for our comparisons). Finally, we experimentally establish the side-channel security improvements that masked mid-pSquare can lead to, reaching unmatched resistance to profiled horizontal attacks on lightweight 32-bit processors (ARM Cortex-M4).",

    "abstract": "Side-channel attacks pose significant threats to cryptographic implementations, which require the inclusion of countermeasures to mitigate these attacks. In this work, we study the masking of state-of-the-art post-quantum signatures based on the MPC-in-the-head paradigm. More precisely, we focus on the recent threshold-computation-in-the-head (TCitH) framework that applies to some NIST candidates of the post-quantum standardization process. We first provide an analysis of side-channel attack paths in the signature algorithms based on the TCitH framework. We then explain how to apply standard  masking to achieve a $d$-probing secure implementation of such schemes, with performance scaling in $O(d^{2})$, for $d$ the masking order. \r\n\r\n    Our main contribution is to introduce different ways to tweak those signature schemes towards their masking friendliness. While the TCitH framework comes in two variants, the GGM variant and the Merkle tree variant, we introduce a specific tweak for each of these variants. These tweaks allow us to achieve complexities of $O(d)$ and $O(d \\log d)$ at the cost of non-constant signature size, caused by the inclusion of additional seeds in the signature. We also propose a third tweak that takes advantage of the threshold secret sharing used in TCitH. With the right choice of parameters, we show how, by design, some parts of the TCitH algorithms satisfy probing security without additional countermeasures. While this approach can substantially reduce the cost of masking in some part of the signature algorithm, it degrades the soundness of the core zero-knowledge proof, hence slightly increasing the size of the signature. \r\n\r\n    We analyze the complexity of the masked implementations of our tweaked TCitH signatures and provide benchmarks on a RISC-V platform with built-in hash accelerator. We use a modular benchmarking approach, allowing to estimate the performance of diverse signature instances with different tweaks and parameters. Our results illustrate how the different variants scale for an increasing masking order. For instance, for a masking order $d = 3$, we obtain signatures of around $14$ kB that run in $0.67$ second on a the target RISC-V CPU with a $250$MHz frequency. This is to be compared with the $4.7$ seconds required by the original signature scheme masked at the same order on the same platform. For a masking order $d=7$, we obtain a signature of $17.5$ kB running in $1.75$ second, to be compared with $16$ seconds for the stardard masked signature. \r\n\r\n    Finally, we discuss the extension of our techniques to signature schemes based on the VOLE-in-the-Head framework, which shares similarities with the GGM variant of TCitH. One key takeaway of our work is that the Merkle tree variant of TCitH is inherently more amenable to efficient masking than frameworks based on GGM trees, such as TCitH-GGM or VOLE-in-the-Head.",

    "abstract": "Solitary output secure computation allows a set of mutually distrustful parties to compute a function of their inputs such that only a designated party obtains the output. Such computations should satisfy various security properties such as correctness, privacy, independence of inputs, and even guaranteed output delivery. We are interested in full security, which captures all of these properties. Solitary output secure computation has been the study of many papers in recent years, as it captures many real-world scenarios.\r\n\r\nA systematic study of fully secure solitary output computation was initiated by Halevi et al. [TCC 2019]. They showed several positive and negative results, however, they did not characterize what functions can be computed with full security. Alon et al. [EUROCRYPT 2024] considered the special, yet important case, of three parties with Boolean output, where the output-receiving party has no input. They completely characterized the set of such functionalities that can be computed with full security. Interestingly, they also showed a possible connection with the seemingly unrelated notion of fairness, where either all parties obtain the output or none of them do.\r\n\r\nWe continue this line of investigation and study the set of three-party solitary output Boolean functionalities where all parties hold private inputs. Our main contribution is defining and analyzing a family of ``special-round'' protocols, which generalizes the set of previously proposed protocols. Our techniques allow us to identify which special-round protocols securely compute a given functionality (if such exists). Interestingly, our analysis can also be applied in the two-party setting (where fairness is an issue). Thus, we believe that our techniques may prove useful in additional settings and deepen our understanding of the connections between the various settings.",

    "abstract": "Since the introduction of TLS 1.3, which includes X25519 and X448 as key exchange algorithms, one could expect that high efficient implementations for these two algorithms become important as the need for power efficient and secure IoT devices increases. Assembly optimised X25519 implementations for low end processors such as Cortex-M4 have existed for some time but there has only been scarce progress on optimised X448 implementations for low end ARM processors such as Cortex-M4 and Cortex-M33. This work attempts to fill this gap by demonstrating how to design a constant time X448 implementation that runs in 2 273 479 cycles on Cortex-M4 and 2 170 710 cycles on Cortex-M33 with DSP. An X25519 implementation is also presented that runs in 441 116 cycles on Cortex-M4 and 411 061 cycles on Cortex-M33 with DSP.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a ring referral scheme, by which a user can publicly prove her knowledge of a valid signature for a private message that is signed by one of an ad hoc set of authorized issuers, without revealing the signing issuer. Ring referral is a natural extension to traditional ring signature by allowing a prover to obtain a signature from a third-party signer. Our scheme is useful for diverse applications, such as certificate-hiding decentralized identity, privacy-enhancing federated authentication, anonymous endorsement and privacy -preserving referral marketing. In contrast with prior issuer-hiding credential schemes, our ring referral scheme supports more distinguishing features, such as (1) public verifiability over an ad hoc ring, (2) strong user anonymity against collusion among the issuers and verifier to track a user, (3) transparent setup,  (4) message hiding, (5) efficient multi-message logarithmic verifiability, (6) threshold scheme for requiring multiple co-signing issuers. Finally, we implemented our ring referral scheme with extensive empirical evaluation",

    "abstract": "We introduce deniable secret sharing (DSS), which, analogously to deniable encryption, enables shareholders to produce fake shares that are consistent with a target \u201cfake message\u201d, regardless of the original secret. In contrast to deniable encryption, in a DSS scheme an adversary sees multiple shares, some of which might be real, and some fake. This makes DSS a more difficult task, especially in situations where the fake shares need to be generated by individual shareholders, without coordination with other shareholders.\r\n\r\nWe define several desirable properties for DSS, and show both positive and negative results for each. The strongest property is fake hiding, which is a natural analogy of deniability for encryption: given a complete set of shares, an adversary cannot determine whether any shares are fake. We show a construction based on Shamir secret sharing that achieves fake hiding as long as (1) the fakers are qualified (number $t$ or more), and (2) the set of real shares which the adversary sees is unqualified. Next we show a construction based on indistinguishability obfuscation that relaxes condition (1) and achieves fake hiding even when the fakers are unqualified (as long as they comprise more than half of the shareholders). We also extend the first construction to provide the weaker property of faker anonymity for all thresholds. (Faker anonymity requires that given some real shares and some fake shares, an adversary should not be able to tell which are fake, even if it can tell that some fake shares are present.) All of these constructions require the fakers to coordinate in order to produce fake shares.\r\n\r\nOn the negative side, we first show that fake hiding is unachievable when the fakers are a minority, even if the fakers coordinate. Further, if the fakers do not coordinate, then even faker anonymity is unachievable as soon as $t < n$ (namely the reconstruction threshold is smaller than the number of parties).",

    "abstract": "The integration of AI agents with Web3 ecosystems harnesses their complementary potential for autonomy and openness, yet also introduces underexplored security risks, as these agents dynamically interact with financial protocols and immutable smart contracts. This paper investigates the vulnerabilities of AI agents within blockchain-based financial ecosystems when exposed to adversarial threats in real-world scenarios. We introduce the concept of context manipulation -- a comprehensive attack vector that exploits unprotected context surfaces, including input channels, memory modules, and external data feeds. Through empirical analysis of ElizaOS, a decentralized AI agent framework for automated Web3 operations, we demonstrate how adversaries can manipulate context by injecting malicious instructions into prompts or historical interaction records, leading to unintended asset transfers and protocol violations which could be financially devastating.  Our findings indicate that prompt-based defenses are insufficient, as malicious inputs can corrupt an agent's stored context, creating cascading vulnerabilities across interactions and platforms. This research highlights the urgent need to develop AI agents that are both secure and fiduciarily responsible.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology and smart contracts have revolutionized digital transactions by enabling trustless and decentralized exchanges of value. However, the inherent transparency and immutability of blockchains pose significant privacy challenges. On-chain data, while pseudonymous, is publicly visible and permanently recorded, potentially leading to the inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information. This issue is particularly pronounced in smart contract applications, where contract details are accessible to all network participants, risking the exposure of identities and transactional details.\r\n\r\nTo address these privacy concerns, there is a pressing need for privacy-preserving mechanisms in smart contracts. To showcase this need even further, in our paper we bring forward advanced use-cases in economics which only smart contracts equipped with privacy mechanisms can realize, and show how  fully-homomorphic encryption (FHE) as a privacy enhancing technology (PET) in smart contracts, operating on a public blockchain, can make possible the implementation of these use-cases. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive systematization of FHE-based approaches in smart contracts, examining their potential to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive information while retaining the benefits of smart contracts, such as automation, decentralization, and security. After we evaluate these existing FHE solutions in the context of the use-cases we consider, we  identify open problems, and suggest future research directions to enhance privacy in blockchain smart contracts.",

    "abstract": "Zero-knowledge range arguments are a fundamental cryptographic primitive that allows a prover to convince a verifier of the knowledge of a secret value lying within a predefined range. They have been utilized in diverse applications, such as confidential transactions, proofs of solvency and anonymous credentials. Range arguments with a transparent setup dispense with any trusted setup to eliminate security backdoor and enhance transparency. They are increasingly deployed in diverse decentralized applications on blockchains. One of the major concerns of practical deployment of range arguments on blockchains is the incurred gas cost and high computational overhead associated with blockchain miners. Hence, it is crucial to optimize the verification efficiency in range arguments to alleviate the deployment cost on blockchains and other decentralized platforms. In this paper, we present VeRange with several new zero-knowledge range arguments in the discrete logarithm setting, requiring only $c \\sqrt{N/\\log N}$ group exponentiations for verification, where $N$ is the number of bits to represent a range and $c$ is a small constant, making them concretely efficient for blockchain deployment with a very low gas cost. Furthermore, VeRange is aggregable, allowing a prover to simultaneously prove $T$ range arguments in a single argument, requiring only $O(\\sqrt{TN/\\log (TN)}) + T$ group exponentiations for verification. We deployed {\\tt VeRange} on Ethereum and measured the empirical gas cost, achieving the fastest verification runtime and the lowest gas cost among the discrete-logarithm-based range arguments in practice.",

    "abstract": "Distinguishing Goppa codes or alternant codes from generic\r\nlinear codes [FGO+11] has been shown to be a first step before being\r\nable to attack McEliece cryptosystem based on those codes [BMT24].\r\nWhereas the distinguisher of [FGO+11] is only able to distinguish Goppa\r\ncodes or alternant codes of rate very close to 1, in [CMT23a] a much more\r\npowerful (and more general) distinguisher was proposed. It is based on\r\ncomputing the Hilbert series $\\{\\mathrm{HF}(d),~d\\in  \\mathbb{N}\\}$ of a Pfaffian modeling.\r\nThe distinguisher of [FGO+11] can be interpreted as computing $\\mathrm{HF}(1)$.\r\nComputing $\\mathrm{HF}(2)$ still gives a polynomial time distinguisher for alternant\r\nor Goppa codes and is apparently able to distinguish Goppa or alternant\r\ncodes in a much broader regime of rates as the one of [FGO+11]. However,\r\nthe scope of this distinguisher was unclear. We give here a formula for\r\n$\\mathrm{HF}(2)$ corresponding to generic alternant codes when the field size $q$\r\nsatisfies $q \\geq r$, where r is the degree of the alternant code. We also\r\nshow that this expression for$\\mathrm{HF}(2)$ provides a lower bound in general.\r\nThe value of $\\mathrm{HF}(2)$ corresponding to random linear codes is known and\r\nthis yields a precise description of the new regime of rates that can be\r\ndistinguished by this new method. This shows that the new distinguisher\r\nimproves significantly upon the one given in [FGO+11].",

    "abstract": "Systems such as file backup services often use content-defined chunking (CDC) algorithms, especially those based on rolling hash techniques, to split files into chunks in a way that allows for data deduplication. These chunking algorithms often depend on per-user parameters in an attempt to avoid leaking information about the data being stored. We present attacks to extract these chunking parameters and discuss protocol-agnostic attacks and loss of security once the parameters are breached (including when these parameters are not setup at all, which is often available as an option). Our parameter-extraction attacks themselves are protocol-specific but their ideas are generalizable to many potential CDC schemes.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Vector Oblivious Linear Evaluation (VOLE) protocols have enabled constant-round, fast, and scalable (designated-verifier) zero-knowledge proofs, significantly reducing prover computational cost. Existing protocols, such as QuickSilver [CCS\u201921] and LPZKv2 [CCS\u201922], achieve efficiency with prover costs of 4 multiplications in the extension field per AND gate for Boolean circuits, with one multiplication requiring a O(\u03ba log \u03ba)-bit operation where \u03ba = 128 is the security parameter and 3-4 field multiplications per multiplication gate for arithmetic circuits over a large field.\r\nWe introduce JesseQ, a suite of two VOLE-based protocols: JQv1 and JQv2, which advance state of the art. JQv1 requires only 2 scalar multiplications in an extension field per AND gate for Boolean circuits, with one scalar needing a O(\u03ba)- bit operation, and 2 field multiplications per multiplication gate for arithmetic circuits over a large field. In terms of communication costs, JQv1 needs just 1 field element per gate. JQv2 further reduces communication costs by half at the cost of doubling the prover\u2019s computation.\r\nExperiments show that, compared to the current state of the art, both JQv1 and JQv2 achieve at least 3.9\u00d7 improvement for Boolean circuits. For large field circuits, JQv1 has a similar performance, while JQv2 offers a 1.3\u00d7 improvement. Additionally, both JQv1 and JQv2 maintain the same communication cost as the current state of the art. Notably, on the cheapest AWS instances, JQv1 can prove 9.2 trillion AND gates (or 5.8 trillion multiplication gates over a 61-bit field) for just one US dollar. JesseQ excels in applications like inner products, matrix multiplication, and lattice problems, delivering 40%- 200% performance improvements compared to QuickSilver. Additionally, JesseQ integrates seamlessly with the sublinear Batchman framework [CCS\u201923], enabling further efficiency gains for batched disjunctive statements.",

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly embedded in high-stakes applications such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, ensuring the verifiability of AI computations without compromising sensitive data or proprietary models is crucial. Zero-knowledge machine learning (ZKML) leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enable the verification of AI model outputs while preserving confidentiality. However, existing ZKML approaches require specialized cryptographic expertise, making them inaccessible to traditional AI developers.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce ZKPyTorch, a compiler that seamlessly integrates ML frameworks like PyTorch with ZKP engines like Expander, simplifying the development of ZKML. ZKPyTorch automates the translation of ML operations into optimized ZKP circuits through three key components. First, a ZKP preprocessor converts models into structured computational graphs and injects necessary auxiliary information to facilitate proof generation. Second, a ZKP-friendly quantization module introduces an optimized quantization strategy that reduces computation bit-widths, enabling efficient ZKP execution within smaller finite fields such as M61. Third, a hierarchical ZKP circuit optimizer employs a multi-level optimization framework at model, operation, and circuit levels to improve proof generation efficiency.\r\n\r\nWe demonstrate ZKPyTorch effectiveness through end-to-end case studies, successfully converting VGG-16 and Llama-3 models from PyTorch, a leading ML framework, into ZKP-compatible circuits recognizable by Expander, a state-of-the-art ZKP engine. Using Expander, we generate zero-knowledge proofs for\r\nthese models, achieving proof generation for the VGG-16 model in 2.2 seconds per CIFAR-10 image for VGG-16 and 150 seconds per token for Llama-3 inference, improving the practical adoption of ZKML.",

    "abstract": "The Fiat-Shamir transformation underlies numerous non-interactive arguments, with variants that differ in important ways. This paper addresses a gap between variants analyzed by theoreticians and variants implemented (and deployed) by practitioners. Specifically, theoretical analyses typically assume parties have access to random oracles with sufficiently large input and output size, while cryptographic hash functions in practice have fixed input and output sizes (pushing practitioners towards other variants).\r\n\r\nIn this paper we propose and analyze a variant of the Fiat-Shamir transformation that is based on an ideal permutation of fixed size. The transformation relies on the popular duplex sponge paradigm, and minimizes the number of calls to the permutation (given the amount of information to absorb and to squeeze). Our variant closely models deployed variants of the Fiat-Shamir transformation, and our analysis provides concrete security bounds that can be used to set security parameters in practice.\r\n\r\nWe additionally contribute spongefish, an open-source Rust library implementing our Fiat-Shamir transformation. The library is interoperable across multiple cryptographic frameworks, and works with any choice of permutation. The library comes equipped with Keccak and Poseidon permutations, as well as several \"codecs\" for re-mapping prover and verifier messages to the permutation's domain.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the intersection of deep learning and differential cryptanalysis has given rise to the emerging field of differential neural cryptanalysis, providing an efficient data-driven paradigm for security evaluation of modern cryptographic algorithms. Traditional differential cryptanalysis relies on manual search for high-probability differential characteristics, a process limited by the nonlinearity complexity of the algorithm.  In contrast, differential neural cryptanalysis improves the efficiency and automation of the analysis by training neural networks to automatically extract statistical features from ciphertext pairs. As research advances, Lu et al. proposed improved related-key neural distinguishers for the SIMON and SIMECK algorithms. However, current methodologies for constructing related-key distinguishers remain highly specialized, lacking a generalized optimization framework to address diverse cryptographic structures.\r\n\r\nThis paper proposes a novel framework for constructing related-key neural differential distinguishers that optimizes three key components: dataset construction (multi-ciphertext multi-difference formats), differential path selection (structural filtering), and network architecture (DRSN for noise suppression). By applying this framework to two standardized algorithms, DES and PRESENT, our experiments demonstrate significant advancements. For DES, the framework achieves an 8-round related-key neural distinguisher and improves 6/7-round distinguisher accuracy by over 40%. For PRESENT, we construct the first 9-round related-key neural distinguisher, which outperforms existing single-key distinguishers in both round coverage and accuracy. Additionally, we employ kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and K-means clustering to evaluate the quality of differential datasets for DES and PRESENT, revealing that clustering compactness strongly correlates with distinguisher performance. Furthermore, we propose a validation algorithm to verify differential combinations with cryptographic advantages from a machine learning perspective, identifying 'good' plaintext-key differential combinations. We apply this approach to the SIMECK algorithm, demonstrating its broad applicability. These findings validate the framework\u2019s effectiveness in bridging cryptographic analysis with data-driven feature extraction and offer new insights for automated security evaluation of block ciphers.",

    "abstract": "Digital signatures underpin identity, authenticity, and trust in modern computer systems. Cryptography research has shown that it is possible to prove possession of a valid message and signature for some public key, without revealing the message or signature. These proofs of possession work only for specially-designed signature schemes. Though these proofs of possession have many useful applications to improving security, privacy, and anonymity, they are not currently usable for widely deployed, legacy signature schemes such as RSA, ECDSA, and Ed25519. Unlocking practical proofs of possession for these legacy signature schemes requires closing a huge efficiency gap.\r\n\r\nThis work brings proofs of possession for legacy signature schemes very close to practicality. Our design strategy is to encode the signature's verification algorithm as a rank-one constraint system (R1CS), then use a zkSNARK to prove knowledge of a solution. To do this efficiently we (1) design and analyze a new zkSNARK called Dorian that supports randomized computations, (2) introduce several new techniques for encoding hashes, elliptic curve operations, and modular arithmetic,  (3) give a new approach that allows performing the most expensive parts of ECDSA and Ed25519 verifications outside R1CS, and (4) generate a novel elliptic curve that allows expressing Ed25519 curve operations very efficiently. Our techniques reduce R1CS sizes by up to 200$\\times$ and prover times by 3-22$\\times$. \r\n\r\nWe can generate a 240-byte proof of possession of an RSA signature over a message the size of a typical TLS certificate (two kilobytes) in only three seconds.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain advancements, currency digitalization, and declining cash usage have fueled global interest in Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). The BIS states that the hybrid model, where central banks authorize intermediaries to manage distribution, is more suitable than the direct model. However, designing a CBDC for practical implementation requires careful consideration. First, the public blockchain raises privacy concerns due to transparency. While zk-SNARKs can be a solution, they can introduce significant proof generation overhead for large-scale transactions. Second, intermediaries that provide user-facing services on behalf of the central bank commonly performs Proof of Liabilities on customers' static liabilities. However, in real-world scenarios where user liabilities can arbitrarily increase or decrease, the static nature poses such as window attacks. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose a new smart contract-based privacy-preserving CBDC framework based on zk-SNARKs, called $\\textbf{Aegis}$. our framework introduces a transaction batching technique to enhance scalability and  defines a new dynamic PoL which is near-real time. We formally define the security models for our system and provide rigorous security proofs to demonstrate its robustness. To evaluate the system\u2019s performance, we instantiate our proposed framework and measure its efficiency. The result indicates that, the end-to-end process, including proof generation for 512 transactions, takes approximately 2.8 seconds, with a gas consumption of 74,726 per user.",

    "abstract": "Power side-channel (PSC) vulnerabilities present formidable challenges to the security of ubiquitous microelectronic devices in mission-critical infrastructure. Existing side-channel assessment techniques mostly focus on post-silicon stages by analyzing power profiles of fabricated devices, suffering from low flexibility and prohibitively high cost while deploying security countermeasures. While pre-silicon PSC assessments offer flexibility and low cost, the true nature of the power signatures cannot be fully captured through RTL or gate-level design. Although physical design-level analysis provides precise power traces, collecting data is time and resource-consuming at the layout level. To address this challenge, we propose, for the first time, a fast and efficient physical design-level PSC assessment framework using a graph neural network (GNN). This framework predicts dynamic power traces for new layouts, using them to assess physical design security through metrics evaluation. Our experiments on AES-GF layout implementations achieve a tremendous 133 times speedup compared to conventional simulation-based flow without sacrificing substantial accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Over two decades since their introduction in 2005, all major verifiable pairing delegation protocols for public inputs have been designed to ensure information-theoretic security. However, we note that a delegation protocol involving only ephemeral secret keys in the public view can achieve everlasting security, provided the server is unable to produce a pairing forgery within the protocol\u2019s execution time. Thus, computationally bounding the adversary\u2019s capabilities during the protocol\u2019s execution, rather than across its entire lifespan, may be more reasonable, especially when the goal is to achieve significant efficiency gains for the delegating party. This consideration is particularly relevant given the continuously evolving computational costs associated with pairing computations and their ancillary blocks, which creates an ever-changing landscape for what constitutes efficiency in pairing delegation protocols. \r\nWith the goal of fulfilling both efficiency and everlasting security, we present AmorE, a protocol equipped with an adjustable security and efficiency parameter for sequential pairing delegation, which achieves state-of-the-art amortized efficiency in terms of the number of pairing computations. For example, delegating batches of 10 pairings on the BLS48-575 elliptic curve via our protocol costs to the client, on average, less than a single scalar multiplication in G2 per delegated pairing, while still ensuring at least 40 bits of statistical security.",

    "abstract": "In order to compute a multiple of a point on an elliptic curve in Weierstrass form one can use formulas in only one of the two coordinates of the points. These $x$-only formulas can be seen as an arithmetic on the Kummer line associated to the curve.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we look at models of Kummer lines, and define an intrinsic notion of isomorphisms of Kummer lines. This allows us to give conversion formulas between Kummer models in a unified manner. When there is one rational point $T$ of $2$-torsion on the curve, we also use Mumford's theory of theta groups to show that there are two type of models: the \u201csymmetric\u201d ones with respect to $T$ and the \u201canti-symmetric\u201c ones. We show how this recovers the Montgomery model and various variants of the theta model.\r\n\r\nWe also classify when curves admit these different models via Galois representations and modular curves. When an elliptic curve is viewed inside a $2$-isogeny volcano, we give a criteria to say if it has a given Kummer model based solely on its position in the volcano.  We also give applications to the ECM factorization algorithm.",

    "abstract": "The current landscape of system-on-chips (SoCs) security verification faces challenges due to manual, labor-intensive, and inflexible methodologies. These issues limit the scalability and effectiveness of security protocols, making bug detection at the Register-Transfer Level (RTL) difficult. This paper proposes a new framework named BugWhisperer that utilizes a specialized, fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) to address these challenges. By enhancing the LLM's hardware security knowledge and leveraging its capabilities for text inference and knowledge transfer, this approach automates and improves the adaptability and reusability of the verification process. We introduce an open-source, fine-tuned LLM specifically designed for detecting security vulnerabilities in SoC designs. Our findings demonstrate that this tailored LLM effectively enhances the efficiency and flexibility of the security verification process. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive hardware vulnerability database that supports this work and will further assist the research community in enhancing the security verification process.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a security analysis of the South Korean Format-Preserving Encryption (FPE) standards FEA-1 and FEA-2. In 2023, Chauhan \\textit{et al.} presented the first third-party analysis of FEA-1 and FEA-2 against the square attack. The authors proposed new distinguishing attacks covering up to three rounds of FEA-1 and five rounds of FEA-2, with a data complexity of $2^8$ plaintexts. Additionally, using these distinguishers, they presented key recovery attacks for four rounds of FEA-1 and six rounds of FEA-2, for 192-bit and 256-bit key sizes. The complexities of both the four-round FEA-1 and six-round FEA-2 key recovery attacks are $2^{137.6}$. \\\\\r\n\r\nIn this work, we successfully extend the number of rounds attacked for both FEA-1 and FEA-2, using the square attack technique. Specifically, we present a four-round distinguishing attack against FEA-1 and six-round distinguishing attack against FEA-2. The data complexities of these distinguishers are $2^{64}$ plaintexts. Furthermore, we apply these distinguishers to perform key recovery attacks on five rounds of FEA-1 and seven rounds of FEA-2, targeting the 256-bit key size. The time complexities of the presented key recovery attacks are $2^{193.6}$.",

    "abstract": "HuFu is an unstructured lattice-based signature scheme proposed during the NIST PQC standardization process. In this work, we present a side-channel analysis of HuFu's reference implementation.\r\n\r\nWe first exploit the multiplications involving its two main secret matrices, recovering approximately half of their entries through a non-profiled power analysis with a few hundred traces. Using these coefficients, we reduce the dimension of the underlying LWE problem, enabling full secret key recovery with calls to a small block-sized BKZ.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this attack, we propose a countermeasure that replaces sensitive computations involving a secret matrix with equivalent operations derived solely from public elements, eliminating approximately half of the identified leakage and rendering the attack unfeasible.\r\n\r\nFinally, we perform a non-profiled power analysis targeting HuFu's Gaussian sampling procedure, recovering around 75\\% of the remaining secret matrix's entries in a few hundred traces. While full key recovery remains computationally intensive, we demonstrate that partial knowledge of the secret significantly improves the efficiency of signature forgery.",

    "abstract": "Digital identity wallets allow citizens to prove who they are and manage digital documents, called credentials, such as mobile driving licenses or passports. As with physical documents, secure and privacy-preserving management of the credential lifecycle is crucial: a credential can change its status from issued to valid, revoked or expired. In this paper, we focus on the analysis of cryptographic accumulators as a revocation scheme for digital identity wallet credentials. We describe the most well-established public key accumulators, and how zero-knowledge proofs can be used with accumulators for revocation of non-anonymous credentials. In addition, we assess the computational and communication costs analytically and experimentally. Our results show that they are comparable with existing schemes used in the context of certificate revocation.",

    "abstract": "This work presents an exact and compact formula for the probability of rotation-xor differentials (RX-differentials) through modular addition, for arbitrary rotation amounts, which has been a long-standing open problem. The formula comes with a rigorous proof and is also verified by extensive experiments.\r\n\r\nOur formula uncovers error in a recent work from 2022 proposing a formula for rotation amounts bigger than 1. Surprisingly, it also affects correctness of the more studied and used formula for the rotation amount equal to 1 (from TOSC 2016). Specifically, it uncovers rare cases where the assumptions of this formula do not hold. Correct formula for arbitrary rotations now opens up a larger search space where one can often find better trails.\r\n\r\nFor applications, we propose automated mixed integer linear programming (MILP) modeling techniques for searching optimal RX-trails based on our exact formula. They are consequently applied to several ARX designs, including Salsa, Alzette and a small-key variant of Speck, and yield many new RX-differential distinguishers, some of them based on provably optimal trails. In order to showcase the relevance of the RX-differential analysis, we also design Malzette, a 12-round Alzette-based permutation with maliciously chosen constants, which has a practical RX-differential distinguisher, while standard differential/linear security arguments suggest sufficient security.",

    "abstract": "In a social key recovery scheme, users back up their secret keys (typically using Shamir's secret sharing) with their social connections, known as a set of guardians. This places a heavy burden on the guardians, as they must manage their shares both securely and reliably. Finding and managing such a set of guardians may not be easy, especially when the consequences of losing a key are significant. \r\n\r\nWe take an alternative approach of social recovery within a community, where each member already holds a secret key (with possibly an associated public key) and uses other community members as their guardians forming a mutual dependency among themselves. Potentially, each member acts as a guardian for upto $(n-1)$ other community members.  Therefore, in this setting, using standard Shamir's sharing leads to a linear ($O(n)$) blow-up in the internal secret storage of the guardian for each key recovery. Our solution avoids this linear blowup in internal secret storage by relying on a novel secret-sharing scheme, leveraging the fact that each member already manages a secret key. In fact, our scheme does not require guardians to store anything beyond their own secret keys. \r\n\r\nWe propose the first formal definition of a social key recovery scheme for general access structures in the community setting. We prove that our scheme is secure against any malicious and adaptive adversary that may corrupt up to $t$ parties. As a main technical tool, we use a new notion of secret sharing, that enables $(t+1)$ out of $n$ sharing of a secret even when the shares are generated independently -- we formalize this as bottom-up secret sharing (BUSS), which may be of independent interest. \r\n\r\nFinally, we provide an implementation benchmarking varying the number of guardians both in a regional, and geo-distributed setting. For instance, for 8 guardians, our backup protocol takes around 146-149 ms in a geo-distributed WAN setting, and 4.9-5.9 ms in the LAN setting; for recovery protocol, the timings are approximately the same for the WAN setting (as network latency dominates), and 1.2-1.4 ms for the LAN setting.",

    "abstract": "A (single server) private information retrieval (PIR) allows a client to read data from a public database held on a remote server, without revealing to the server which locations she is reading. In a doubly efficient PIR (DEPIR), the database is first preprocessed offline into a data structure, which then allows the server to answer any client query efficiently in sub-linear  online time. Constructing DEPIR is a notoriously difficult problem, and this difficulty even extends to a weaker notion secret-key DEPIR (SK-DEPIR), where the database is preprocessed using secret randomness and the client is given a secret key for making queries.  We currently only have constructions of SK-DEPIR from the Ring LWE assumption or from non-standard code-based assumptions. \r\n\r\n We show that the black-box use of essentially all generic cryptographic primitives (e.g., key agreement, oblivious transfer, indistinguishability obfuscation, etc.), including idealized primitives (e.g., random oracles, generic multilinear groups, virtual black-box obfuscation, etc.) is essentially useless for constructing SK-DEPIR. In particular, in any such SK-DEPIR construction, we can replace all black-box use of these primitives with just a black-box use of one-way functions. While we conjecture that SK-DEPIR cannot be constructed using black-box one-way functions alone, we are unable to show this in its full generality. However, we do show this for 2-round schemes with a passive server that simply outputs requested locations in the preprocessed data structure, which is the format of all known schemes. Overall, this shows that the black-box use of essentially all crypto primitives is insufficient for constructing 2-round passive-server SK-DEPIR, and does not provide any benefit beyond black-box one-way functions for constructing general SK-DEPIR.",

    "abstract": "Hardware IP blocks have been subjected to various forms of confidentiality and integrity attacks in recent years due to the globalization of the semiconductor industry. System-on-chip (SoC) designers are now considering a zero-trust model for security, where an IP can be attacked at any stage of the manufacturing process for piracy, cloning, overproduction, or malicious alterations. Hardware redaction has emerged as a promising countermeasure to thwart confidentiality and integrity attacks by untrusted entities in the globally distributed supply chain. However, existing redaction techniques provide this security at high overhead costs, making them unsuitable for real-world implementation. In this paper, we propose HIPR, a fine-grain redaction methodology that is robust, scalable, and incurs significantly lower overhead compared to existing redaction techniques. HIPR redacts security-critical Boolean and sequential logic from the hardware design, performs interconnect randomization, and employs multiple overhead optimization steps to reduce overhead costs. We evaluate HIPR on open-source benchmarks and reduce area overheads by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art redaction techniques without compromising security. We also demonstrate that the redaction performed by HIPR is resilient against conventional functional and structural attacks on hardware IPs. The redacted test IPs used to evaluate HIPR are available at: https://github.com/UF-Nelms-IoT-Git-Projects/HIPR.",

    "abstract": "We analyze the composition of symmetric encryption and digital signatures in secure group messaging protocols where group members share a symmetric encryption key. In particular, we analyze the chat encryption algorithms underlying MLS, Session, Signal, and Matrix using the formalism of symmetric signcryption introduced by Jaeger, Kumar, and Stepanovs (Eurocrypt 2024). We identify theoretical attacks against each of the constructions we analyze that result from the insufficient binding between the symmetric encryption scheme and the digital signature scheme. In the case of MLS and Session, these translate into practically exploitable replay and reordering attacks by a group-insider. For Signal this leads to a forgery attack by a group-outsider with access to a user\u2019s signing key, an attack previously discovered by Balb\u00e1s, Collins, and Gajland (Asiacrypt 2023). In Matrix there are mitigations in the broader ecosystem that prevent exploitation. We provide formal security theorems that each of the four constructions are secure up to these attacks. Additionally, in Session we identified two attacks outside the symmetric signcryption model. The first allows a group-outsider with access to an exposed signing key to forge arbitrary messages and the second allows outsiders to replay ciphertexts.",

    "abstract": "In order for a client to securely connect to a server on the web, the client must trust certificate authorities (CAs) only to issue certificates to the legitimate operator of the server. If a certificate is miss-issued, it is possible for an attacker to impersonate the server to the client. The goal of Certificate Transparency (CT) is to log every certificate issued in a manner that allows anyone to audit the logs for miss-issuance. A client can even audit a CT log itself, but this would leak sensitive browsing data to the log operator. As a result, client-side audits are rare in practice. \r\nIn this work, we revisit private CT auditing from a real-world perspective. Our study is motivated by recent changes to the CT ecosystem and advancements in Private Information Retrieval (PIR). First, we find that checking for inclusion of Signed Certificate Timestamps (SCTs) in a log \u2014 the audit performed by clients \u2014 is now possible with PIR in under a second and under 100kb of communication with minor adjustments to the protocol that have been proposed previously. Our results also show how to scale audits by using existing batching techniques and the algebraic structure of the PIR protocols, in particular to obtain certificate hashes by included in the log.\r\nSince PIR protocols are more performant with smaller databases, we also suggest a number of strategies to lower the size of the SCT database for audits. Our key observation is that the web will likely transition to a new model for certificate issuance. While this transition is primarily motivated by the need to adapt the PKI to larger, post-quantum signature schemes, it also removes the need for SCT audits in most cases. We present the first estimates of how this transition may impact SCT auditing, based on data gathered from public CT logs. We find that large scale deployment of the new issuance model may reduce the number of SCT audits needed by a factor of 1,000, making PIR-based auditing practical to deploy.",

    "abstract": "Distributed SNARKs enable multiple provers to collaboratively generate proofs, enhancing the efficiency and scalability of large-scale computations. The state-of-the-art distributed SNARK for Plonk, Pianist (S\\&P '24), achieves constant proof size, constant amortized communication complexity, and constant verifier complexity. However, when proving the Rank-One Constraint System (R1CS), a widely used intermediate representation for SNARKs, Pianist must perform the transformation from R1CS into Plonk before proving, which can introduce a start-up cost of $10\\times$ due to the expansion of the statement size. Meanwhile, existing distributed SNARKs for R1CS, e.g., DIZK (USENIX Sec. '18) and Hekaton (CCS '24), fail to match the superior asymptotic complexities of Pianist.\r\n\r\nWe propose $\\textsf{Soloist}$, an optimized distributed SNARK for R1CS. $\\textsf{Soloist}$ achieves constant proof size, constant amortized communication complexity, and constant verifier complexity, relative to the R1CS size $n$. Utilized with $\\ell$ sub-provers, its prover complexity is $O(n/\\ell \\cdot \\log(n/\\ell))$. The concrete prover time is~$\\ell\\times$ as fast as the R1CS-targeted Marlin (Eurocrypt '20). For zkRollups, $\\textsf{Soloist}$ can prove more transactions, with $2.5 \\times$ smaller memory costs, $2.8\\times$ faster preprocessing, and $1.8\\times$ faster proving than Pianist.\r\n\r\n$\\textsf{Soloist}$ leverages an improved inner product argument and a new batch bivariate polynomial commitment variant of KZG (Asiacrypt '10). To achieve constant verification, we propose a new preprocessing method with a lookup argument for unprescribed tables, which are usually assumed pre-committed in prior works. Notably, all these schemes are equipped with scalable distributed mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Content-defined chunking (CDC) algorithms split streams of data into smaller blocks, called chunks, in a way that preserves chunk boundaries when the data is partially changed. CDC is ubiquitous in applications that deduplicate data such as backup solutions, software patching systems, and file hosting platforms. Much like compression, CDC can introduce leakage when combined with encryption: fingerprinting attacks can exploit chunk length patterns to infer information about the data.\r\nTo address these risks, many systems\u2014mainly in the cloud backup setting\u2014have developed bespoke mitigations by mixing a cryptographic key into the chunking process. We study these keyed CDC (KCDC) schemes \u201cin the wild\u201d, presenting efficient key recovery attacks against five different KCDC schemes, deployed in the backup solutions Borg, Bupstash, Duplicacy, Restic, and Tarsnap. Our attacks are in a realistic threat model that relies only on weak known or chosen-plaintext capabilities. This shows, in particular, that they fail to protect against fingerprinting attacks. To demonstrate practical exploitability, we also present \u201cend-to-end\u201d attacks on three complete encrypted backup applications, namely Borg, Restic and Tarsnap. These build on our attacks on the underlying KCDC schemes.\r\nIn an effort to tackle these problems, we introduce the first formal treatment for KCDC schemes and propose a provably secure construction that fulfills a strong notion of security. We benchmark our construction against existing (broken) approaches, showing that it has competitive performance. In doing so, we take a step towards making real-world systems that rely on KCDC more resilient to attacks.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a side-channel attack on the hardware AES accelerator of a Bluetooth chip used in millions of devices worldwide, ranging from wearables and smart home products to industrial IoT. The attack leverages information about AES computations unintentionally transmitted by the chip together with RF signals to recover the encryption key. Unlike traditional side-channel attacks that rely on power or near-field electromagnetic emissions as sources of information, RF-based attacks leave no evidence of tampering, as they do not require package removal, chip decapsulation, or additional soldered components. However, side-channel emissions extracted from RF signals are considerably weaker and noisier, necessitating more traces for key recovery. The presented profiled machine learning-assisted attack can recover the full encryption key from 90,000 traces captured at a one-meter distance from the target device, with each trace being an average of 10,000 samples per encryption. This is a twofold improvement over the correlation analysis-based attack on the same AES accelerator.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based side-channel analysis has become a popular and powerful option for side-channel attacks in recent years. One of the main directions that the side-channel community explores is how to design efficient architectures that can break the targets with as little as possible attack traces, but also how to consistently build such architectures.\r\nIn this work, we explore the usage of the JumpReLU activation function, which was designed to improve the robustness of neural networks. Intuitively speaking, improving the robustness seems a natural requirement for side-channel analysis, as hiding countermeasures could be considered adversarial attacks. \r\nIn our experiments, we explore three strategies: 1) exchanging the activation functions with JumpReLU at the inference phase, training common side-channel architectures with JumpReLU, and 3) conducting hyperparameter search with JumpReLU as the activation function. While the first two options do not yield improvements in results (but also do not show worse performance), the third option brings advantages, especially considering the number of neural networks that break the target. As such, we conclude that using JumpReLU is a good option to improve the stability of attack results.",

    "abstract": "Current hardware security verification processes predominantly rely on manual threat modeling and test plan generation, which are labor-intensive, error-prone, and struggle to scale with increasing design complexity and evolving attack methodologies. To address these challenges, we propose ThreatLens, an LLM-driven multi-agent framework that automates security threat modeling and test plan generation for hardware security verification. ThreatLens integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to extract relevant security knowledge, LLM-powered reasoning for threat assessment, and interactive user feedback to ensure the generation of practical test plans. By automating these processes, the framework reduces the manual verification effort, enhances coverage, and ensures a structured, adaptable approach to security verification. We evaluated our framework on the NEORV32 SoC, demonstrating its capability to automate security verification through structured test plans and validating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Since the selection of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization algorithms, research on integrating PQC into security protocols such as TLS/SSL, IPSec, and DNSSEC has been actively pursued. However, PQC migration for Internet of Things (IoT) communication protocols remains largely unexplored. Embedded devices in IoT environments have limited computational power and memory, making it crucial to optimize PQC algorithms for efficient computation and minimal memory usage when deploying them on low-spec IoT devices. In this paper, we introduce KEM-MQTT, a lightweight and efficient Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) for the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, widely used in IoT environments. Our approach applies the NIST KEM algorithm Crystals-Kyber (Kyber) while leveraging MQTT\u2019s characteristics and sensor node constraints. To enhance efficiency, we address certificate verification issues and adopt KEMTLS to eliminate the need for Post-Quantum Digital Signatures Algorithm (PQC-DSA) in mutual authentication. As a result, KEM-MQTT retains its lightweight properties while maintaining the security guarantees of TLS 1.3. We identify inefficiencies in existing Kyber implementations on 8-bit AVR microcontrollers (MCUs), which are highly resource-constrained. To address this, we propose novel implementation techniques that optimize Kyber for AVR, focusing on high-speed execution, reduced memory consumption, and secure implementation, including Signed LookUp-Table (LUT) Reduction. Our optimized Kyber achieves performance gains of 81%,75%, and 85% in the KeyGen, Encaps, and DeCaps processes, respectively, compared to the reference implementation. With approximately 3 KB of stack usage, our Kyber implementation surpasses all state-of-the-art Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) implementations. Finally, in KEM-MQTT using Kyber-512, an 8-bit AVR device completes the handshake preparation process in 4.32 seconds, excluding the physical transmission and reception times.",

    "abstract": "Both masking and shuffling are very common software countermeasures against side-channel attacks. However, exploring possible combinations of the two countermeasures to increase and fine-tune side-channel resilience is less investigated. With this work, we aim to bridge that gap by both concretising the security guarantees of several masking and shuffling combinations presented in earlier work and additionally investigating their randomness cost. We subsequently implement these approaches to also analyse their performance. In this context, we present five different protected implementations of the new standard for lightweight cryptography, Ascon, on a 32-bit RISC-V architecture: A 3rd-order masked, unshuffled implementation and three combined 3rd-order masked and shuffled implementations. Additionally, we present a levelled implementation where only the particularly vulnerable keyed initialisation and finalisation of the permutation are masked and shuffled, while the rest is only shuffled. To further improve the security and performance of our implementations we make use of the Probe Isolating Non-Interference (PINI) masked AND gadget, coupled with techniques like bit-slicing and bit-interleaving. Utilising benchmarking and an MI-shortcut security analysis, we pinpoint the best masking-shuffling combinations that maximize security at reasonable overheads.",

    "abstract": "Fruit-F is a lightweight short-state stream cipher designed by Ghafari et al. The authors designed this version of the cipher, after earlier versions of the cipher viz. Fruit 80/v2 succumbed to correlation attacks. The primary motivation behind this design seemed to be preventing correlation attacks. Fruit-F has a Grain-like structure with two state registers of size 50 bits each. In addition, the cipher uses an 80-bit secret key and an 80-bit IV. The authors use a complex key-derivation function to update the non-linear register which prevents the same key-bit alignment across fixed-length window of keystream bits, which is essentially what stops the correlation attacks.  \r\nIn this paper, we first present two attacks against Fruit-F. The first attack stems from the fact that the key-derivation can be rewritten as the Boolean xor of two key-dependent terms one of which is the Boolean OR of two bits of the key. Using this we show that the cipher does not offer 80-bit security: the effective key space of Fruit-F is slightly less than $2^{80}$, i.e. a simple brute force attack costs around $2^{80}-2^{49}$ time. The second is a differential attack using the cipher's complex initialization process. We show that under some given conditions, it is possible to have two initial vectors $V_1$ and $V_2$ that produce identical keystream vectors with any given key. Using this as a distinguisher, it is possible to collect enough linear and quadratic equations of the secret key to find it in practical time with very few keystream bits.",

    "abstract": "Current DAG-based BFT protocols face a critical trade-off: certified DAGs provide strong security guarantees but require additional rounds of communication to progress the DAG construction, while uncertified DAGs achieve lower latency at the cost of either reduced resistance to adversarial behaviour or higher communication costs.\r\n\r\nThis paper presents Starfish, a partially synchronous DAG-based BFT protocol that achieves the security properties of certified DAGs, the efficiency of uncertified approaches and linear amortized communication complexity. The key innovation is Encoded Cordial Dissemination, a push-based dissemination strategy that combines Reed-Solomon erasure coding with Data Availability Certificates (DACs). Each of the $n=3f+1$ validators disseminates complete transaction data for its own blocks while distributing encoded shards for others' blocks, enabling efficient data reconstruction with just $f+1$ shards. Building on the previous uncertified DAG BFT commit rule, Starfish extends it to efficiently verify data availability through committed leader blocks serving as DACs.  For large enough transaction data, this design allows Starfish to achieve $O(n)$ amortized communication complexity per committed transaction byte. The average and worst-case end-to-end latencies for Starfish are rigorously proven to be bounded by $7.5\\delta$ and $11\\delta$ in the steady state, where $\\delta$ denotes the actual network delay.\r\n\r\nExperimental evaluation against state-of-the-art DAG BFT protocols demonstrates Starfish's robust performance under steady-state and Byzantine scenarios. \r\nOur results show that strong Byzantine fault tolerance, high performance, and low communication complexity can coexist in DAG BFT protocols, making Starfish particularly suitable for large-scale distributed ledger deployments.",

    "abstract": "The Nintendo DSi is a handheld gaming console released by Nintendo in 2008. In Nintendo's line-up the DSi served as a successor to the DS and was later succeeded by the 3DS. The security systems of both the DS and 3DS have been fully analysed and defeated. However, for over 14 years the security systems of the Nintendo DSi remained standing and had not been fully analysed. To that end this work builds on existing research and demonstrates the use of a second-order fault injection attack to extract the ROM bootloaders stored in the custom system-on-chip used by the DSi. We analyse the effect of the induced fault and compare it to theoretical fault models. Additionally, we present a security analysis of the extracted ROM bootloaders and develop a modchip using cheap off-the-shelf components. The modchip allows to jailbreak the console, but more importantly allows to resurrect consoles previously assumed irreparable.",

    "abstract": "Issuing tokens on Bitcoin remains a highly sought-after goal, driven by its market dominance and robust security. However, Bitcoin's limited on-chain storage and functionality pose significant challenges. Among the various approaches to token issuance on Bitcoin, client-side validation (CSV) has emerged as a prominent solution. CSV delegates data storage and functionalities beyond Bitcoin\u2019s native capabilities to off-chain clients, while leveraging the blockchain to validate tokens and prevent double-spending. Nevertheless, these protocols require participants to maintain token ownership and transactional data, rendering them vulnerable to data loss and malicious data withholding. In this paper, we propose UTxO binding, a novel framework that achieves both robust data availability and enhanced functionality compared to existing CSV designs. This approach securely binds a Bitcoin UTxO, which prevents double-spending, to a UTxO on an auxiliary blockchain, providing data storage and programmability. We formally prove its security and implement our design using Nervos CKB as the auxiliary blockchain.",

    "abstract": "Embedded devices can be exposed to a wide range of attacks. Some classes of attacks can be mitigated using security features or dedicated countermeasures. Examples include Trusted Execution Environments, and masking countermeasures against physical side-channel attacks. However, a system that incorporates such secure components is not automatically a secure system. Partial Key Overwrite attacks are one class of attacks that specifically target the interface between different components of the security system. These attacks may allow an adversary to extract otherwise protected cryptographic keys through careful manipulation of memory-mapped registers. So far this powerful class of attacks has received little attention in the academic literature. In this work, we provide an overview of known Partial Key Overwrite vulnerabilities and how they were used in real-world attacks. Additionally, we evaluated 31 common microcontrollers and embedded microprocessors from eleven distinct vendors and detail our findings. Based on a first high-level evaluation we selected 15 SoCs and performed an in-depth evaluation. This evaluation revealed that at least eight of these SoCs are vulnerable to partial key overwrite attacks.",

    "abstract": "Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are cryptographic protocols that enable a prover to convince a verifier of a statement's truth without revealing any details beyond its validity. Typically, the statement is encoded as an arithmetic circuit, and allows the prover to demonstrate that the circuit evaluates to true without revealing its inputs. Despite their potential to enhance privacy and security, ZKPs are difficult to write and optimize, limiting their adoption in machine learning and data science. To address these challenges, we introduce Zinnia, a zero-knowledge programming framework with high utility, expressiveness and efficiency for tensor-oriented computation. Zinnia provides a high-level programming language that enables developers to easily write ZKP programs, and it employs a novel symbolic execution-inspired approach to extracting semantics from these programs to generate arithmetic circuits. Zinnia supports tensor-oriented computations and provides a rich set of programming constructs, optimizations, and a powerful static type system for expressing and optimizing complex logic. We evaluate Zinnia across 25 real-world programming tasks and a user study, comparing it to existing solutions, including DSLs and zkVMs (Halo2, SP1, and RISC0). Our results demonstrate that Zinnia outperforms these baselines in utility, expressiveness, and efficiency, with a statistically significant reduction in development time, $2-3\\times$ shorter code length, 19.3% smaller circuit size, and up to $245\\times$ faster proving time compared to zkVMs, paving the way for practical ZKP applications in various domains.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has become a crucial framework for collaboratively training Machine Learning (ML) models while ensuring data privacy. Traditional synchronous FL approaches, however, suffer from delays caused by slower clients (called stragglers), which hinder the overall training process.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, in a synchronous setting, model aggregation happens once all the intended clients have submitted their local updates to the server. To address these inefficiencies, Buffered Asynchronous FL (BAsyncFL) was introduced, allowing clients to update the global model as soon as they complete local training. In such a setting, the new global model is obtained once the buffer is full, thus removing synchronization bottlenecks. Despite these advantages, existing Secure Aggregation (SA) techniques\u2014designed to protect client updates from inference attacks\u2014rely on synchronized rounds, making them unsuitable for asynchronous settings.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present Buffalo, the first practical SA protocol tailored for BAsyncFL. Buffalo leverages lattice-based encryption to handle scalability challenges in large ML models and introduces a new role, the assistant, to support the server in securely aggregating client updates. To protect against an actively corrupted server, we enable clients to verify that their local updates have been correctly integrated into the global model. Our comprehensive evaluation\u2014incorporating theoretical analysis and real-world experiments on benchmark datasets\u2014demonstrates that Buffalo is an efficient and scalable privacy-preserving solution in BAsyncFL environments.",

    "abstract": "At CRYPTO 2015, Kirchner and Fouque claimed that a carefully tuned variant of the Blum-Kalai-Wasserman (BKW) algorithm (JACM 2003) should solve the Learning with Errors problem (LWE) in slightly subexponential time for modulus $q=\\mathrm{poly}(n)$ and narrow error distribution, when given enough LWE samples. Taking a modular view, one may regard BKW as a combination of Wagner's algorithm (CRYPTO 2002), run over the corresponding dual problem, and the Aharonov-Regev distinguisher (JACM 2005). Hence the subexponential Wagner step alone should be of interest for solving this dual problem - namely, the Short Integer Solution problem (SIS) - but this appears to be undocumented so far.\r\n\r\nWe re-interpret this Wagner step as walking backward through a chain of projected lattices, zigzagging through some auxiliary superlattices. We further randomize the bucketing step using Gaussian randomized rounding to exploit the powerful discrete Gaussian machinery. This approach avoids sample amplification and turns Wagner's algorithm into an approximate discrete Gaussian sampler for $q$-ary lattices. \r\n    \r\nFor an SIS lattice with $n$ equations modulo $q$, this algorithm runs in subexponential time $\\exp(O(n/\\log \\log n))$ to reach a Gaussian width parameter $s = q/\\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ only requiring $m = n + \\omega(n/\\log \\log n)$ many SIS variables. This directly provides a provable algorithm for solving the Short Integer Solution problem in the infinity norm ($\\mathrm{SIS}^\\infty$) for norm bounds $\\beta = q/\\mathrm{polylog}(n)$. This variant of SIS underlies the security of the NIST post-quantum cryptography standard Dilithium. Despite its subexponential complexity, Wagner's algorithm does not appear to threaten Dilithium's concrete security.",

    "abstract": "Conventional Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing (PVSS) protocols allow a dealer to share a secret among $n$ parties without interaction, ensuring that any $t + 1$ parties (where $t+1 \\le n$) can recover the secret, while anyone can publicly verify the validity of both the individual shares and the reconstructed secret. PVSS schemes are shown to be a key tool in a wide range of practical applications. In this paper, we introduce Pre-constructed PVSS (PPVSS), an extension of standard PVSS schemes, highlighting its enhanced utility and efficiency in various protocols. Unlike standard PVSS, PPVSS requires the dealer to publish a commitment or encryption of the main secret and incorporates a novel secret reconstruction method. We show that these refinements make PPVSS more practical and versatile than conventional PVSS schemes. \r\nTo build a PPVSS scheme, we first point out that the well-known PVSS scheme by Schoenmakers (CRYPTO'99) and its pairing-based variant presented by Heidarvand and Villar (SAC'08) can be seen as special cases of PPVSS, where the dealer also publishes a commitment to the main secret. However, these protocols are not practical for many applications due to efficiency limitations and are less flexible compared to a standard PPVSS scheme. To address this, we propose a general strategy for transforming a Shamir-based PVSS scheme into a PPVSS scheme. Using this strategy, we construct two practical PPVSS schemes in both the Random Oracle (RO) and plain models, grounded in state-of-the-art PVSS designs. Leveraging the new RO-based PPVSS scheme, we revisit some applications and present more efficient variants. Notably, we propose a new universally verifiable e-voting protocol that improves on the alternative scheme by Schoenmakers (CRYPTO'99), reducing the verification complexity with $m$ voters from $O(n^2m)$ to $O(nm)$ exponentiations--a previously unattainable goal with standard PVSS schemes. Our implementation results demonstrate that both our proposed PPVSS schemes and the new universally verifiable e-voting protocol significantly outperform existing alternatives in terms of efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The GCM authenticated encryption (AE) scheme is one of the most widely used AE schemes in the world, while it suffers from risk of nonce misuse, short message length per encryption and an insufficient level of security. The goal of this paper is to design new AE schemes achieving stronger provable security in the standard model and accepting longer nonces (or providing nonce misuse resistance), with the design rationale behind GCM. \r\n\r\nAs a result, we propose two enhanced variants of GCM and GCM-SIV, dubbed eGCM and eGCM-SIV, respectively. eGCM and eGCM-SIV are built on top of a new CENC-type encryption mode, dubbed eCTR: using 2n-bit counters, eCTR enjoys beyond-birthday-bound security without significant loss of efficiency. eCTR is combined with an almost uniform and almost universal hash function, yielding a variable input-length variable output-length pseudorandom function, dubbed HteC. GCM and GCM-SIV are constructed using eCTR and HteC as building blocks.\r\n\r\neGCM and eGCM-SIV accept nonces of arbitrary length, and provide almost the full security (namely, n-bit security when they are based on an n-bit block cipher) for a constant maximum input length, under the assumption that the underlying block cipher is a pseudorandom permutation (PRP). Their efficiency is also comparable to GCM in terms of the rate and the overall speed.",

    "abstract": "Yao's garbled circuits have received huge attention in both theory and practice. While garbled circuits can be constructed using minimal assumption (i.e., the existence of pseudorandom functions or one-way functions), the state-of-the-art constructions (e.g., Rosulek-Roy, Crypto 2021) are based on stronger assumptions. In particular, the ``Free-XOR'' technique (Kolesnikov-Schneider, ICALP 2008) is essential in these state-of-the-art constructions, and their security can only be proven in the random oracle model, or rely on the ``circular-correlation robust hash'' assumption.  \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we aim to develop new techniques to construct efficient garbling schemes using minimal assumptions. Instead of generically replacing the Free-XOR technique, we focus on garbling schemes for specific functionalities. We successfully eliminated the need for Free-XOR in several state-of-the-art schemes, including the one-hot garbling (Heath and Kolesnikov, CCS 2021) and the garbled pseudorandom functions, and the garbled lookup tables (Heath, Kolesnikov and Ng, Eurocrypt 2024). Our schemes are based on minimal assumptions, i.e., standard pseudorandom functions (PRFs)---we resolved the need for circular security. The performance of our scheme is almost as efficient as the best results except for a small constant factor. Namely, for any lookup table $\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}^m$, our scheme takes $n + (5n+9)m\\lambda + 2^n \\cdot m$ bits of communication, where $\\lambda$ is the security parameter of PRF.",

    "abstract": "Know Your Customer (KYC) is a core component of the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) framework, designed to prevent illicit activities within financial systems. However, enforcing KYC and AML on blockchains remains challenging due to difficulties in establishing accountability and preserving user privacy. This study proposes REGKYC, a privacy-preserving Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) framework that balances user privacy with externally mandated KYC and AML requirements. REGKYC leverages a structured ABAC model to support the flexible verification of KYC attributes and the enforcement of compliance policies, providing benefits to multiple stakeholders. First, it enables legitimate users to meet compliance requirements while preserving the privacy of their on-chain activities. Second, it empowers Crypto-asset Service Providers (CASPs) to tailor compliance policies to operational needs, ensuring adaptability to evolving regulations. Finally, it enhances regulatory accountability by enabling authorized deanonymization of malicious actors. We hope this work inspires future research to harmonize user privacy and regulatory compliance in blockchain systems.",

    "abstract": "The Middle-Product Learning with Errors (MPLWE) assumption is a variant of the Learning with Errors (LWE) assumption. The MPLWE assumption reduces the key size of corresponding LWE-based schemes by setting keys as sets of polynomials. Moreover, MPLWE has more robust security than other LWE variants such as Ring-LWE\r\nand Module-LWE. Lombardi et al. proposed an identity-based encryption (IBE) scheme (LVV-IBE) based on the MPLWE assumption in the random oracle model (ROM) by following Gentry et al.'s IBE scheme (GPV-IBE) based on LWE. Due to the benefit of MPLWE, LVV-IBE has a shorter master public key and a secret key than GPV-IBE without changing the size of a ciphertext. However, Lombardi et al.'s proof is not tight in the ROM, while Katsumata et al. proved that GPV-IBE achieves tight adaptive anonymity in the quantum ROM (QROM). Revocable IBE (RIBE) is a variant of IBE supporting a key revocation mechanism to remove malicious users from the system. Takayasu proposed the most efficient RIBE scheme (Takayasu-RIBE) based on LWE achieving tight adaptive anonymity in the QROM. Although a concrete RIBE scheme based on MPLWE has not been proposed, we can construct a scheme (LVV-based RIBE) by applying Ma and Lin's generic transformation to LVV-IBE. Due to the benefit of MPLWE, LVV-based RIBE has an asymptotically shorter master public key and a shorter secret key than Takayasu-RIBE although the former has a larger ciphertext than the latter. Moreover, the security proof is not tight and anonymous in the ROM due to security proofs of Ma-Lin and Lombardi et al. In this paper, we propose a concrete RIBE scheme based on MPLWE. Compared with the above RIBE schemes, the proposed RIBE scheme is the most asymptotically efficient since the sizes of a master public key and a secret key (resp. ciphertext) of the proposed scheme are the same as those of LVV-based RIBE scheme (resp. Takayasu-RIBE). Moreover, we prove the tight adaptive anonymity of the proposed RIBE scheme in the QROM. For this purpose, we also prove the tight adaptive anonymity of LVV-IBE in the QROM.",

    "abstract": "Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is a promising primitive for evaluating arbitrary circuits while keeping the user's privacy. We investigate how to use HE in the multi-party setting where data is encrypted with several distinct keys. One may use the Multi-Key Homomorphic Encryption (MKHE) in this setting, but it has space/computation overhead of $\\mathcal O(n)$ for the number of users $n$, which makes it impractical when $n$ grows large. On the contrary, Multi-Party Homomorphic Encryption (MPHE) is the other Homomorphic Encryption primitive in the multi-party setting, where the space/computation overhead is $\\mathcal O(1)$; however, is limited in terms of ciphertext reusability and dynamicity, that ciphertexts are encrypted just for a group of parties and cannot be reused for other purposes, and that additional parties cannot join the computation dynamically. \r\n\r\nContrary to MKHE, where the secret key owners engage only in the decryption phase, we consider a more relaxed situation where the secret key owners can communicate before the computation. In that case, we can reduce the size of a ciphertext and the evaluation complexity from $\\mathcal O(n)$ to $\\mathcal O(1)$ as in a single-key HE setting. We call this primitive as {\\em Reusable Dynamic Multi-Party Homomorphic Encryption}, which is more suitable in real-world scenarios.\r\n\r\nWe show that 1) the procedures before the computation can be done in a very few rounds of communications, 2) the evaluation/space complexities are independent of the number of users, and 3) the functionalities are as efficient as MKHE, with asymptotic analysis and with implementation.",

    "abstract": "The Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Standard (ML-DSA), formerly known as CRYSTALS-Dilithium, is a lattice-based post-quantum cryptographic scheme. In August 2024, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) officially standardized ML-DSA under FIPS 204. Dilithium generates one valid signature and multiple rejected signatures during the signing process. Most Side-Channel Attacks targeting Dilithium have focused solely on the valid signature, while neglecting the hints contained in rejected signatures. In this paper, we propose a method for recovering the private key by simultaneously leveraging side-channel leakages from both valid signatures and rejected signatures. This approach minimizes the number of signing attempts required for full key recovery. We construct a factor graph incorporating all relevant side-channel leakages and apply the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm for private key recovery.\r\n\r\nWe conducted a proof-of-concept experiment on a Cortex M4 core chip, where the results demonstrate that utilizing rejected signatures reduces the required number of traces by at least $42\\%$ for full key recovery. A minimum of a single trace can recover the private key with a success rate of $30\\%$. Our findings highlight that protecting rejected signatures is crucial, as their leakage provides valuable side-channel information. We strongly recommend implementing countermeasures for rejected signatures during the signing process to mitigate potential threats.",

    "abstract": "In 2012, the Tor project expressed the need to upgrade Tor's onion encryption scheme to protect against tagging attacks and thereby strengthen its end-to-end integrity protection. Tor proposal 261, where each encryption layer is processed by a strongly secure, yet relatively expensive tweakable wide-block cipher, is the only concrete candidate replacement to be backed by formal, yet partial, security proofs (Degabriele and Stam, EUROCRYPT 2018, and Rogaway and Zhang, PoPETS 2018).\r\n\r\nWe propose an alternative onion encryption scheme, called Counter Galois Onion (CGO), that follows a minimalistic, modular design and includes several improvements over proposal 261. CGO's underlying primitive is an updatable tweakable split-domain cipher accompanied with a new security notion, that augments the recently introduced rugged pseudorandom permutation (Degabriele and Karad\u017ei\u0107, CRYPTO 2022). Thus, we relax the security compared to a tweakable wide-block cipher, allowing for more efficient designs. We suggest a concrete instantiation for the updatable tweakable split-domain cipher and report on our experiments comparing the performance of CGO with Tor's existing onion encryption scheme.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\r\nThe Singularity Random Number Generator (SRNG) represents a groundbreaking advancement in the generation of random numbers by integrating two key properties - computational irreducibility and seed independence - into a deterministic algorithm. Unlike conventional pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) whose randomness is intrinsically linked to seed quality or chaotic sensitivity, SRNG transforms even low-entropy seeds into complex, unpredictable outputs. SRNG demonstrates high-quality randomness can emerge independently of seed entropy or size. This paper explores how SRNG not only challenges classical paradigms of predictability in deterministic systems but also offers transformative applications in cryptography, artificial intelligence (AI), and interdisciplinary research. Furthermore, by drawing parallels with cognitive variability research - such as insights from the Forbes article \u201cWhy A \u2018Productively Distracted\u2019 Brain Is A Superpower\u201d - we discuss how the emergent unpredictability of SRNG may contribute to enhanced adaptive learning and decision-making processes in AI systems. Ultimately, SRNG is presented as a model that bridges the realms of science and mystery, inviting a new understanding of randomness and the limits of scientific inquiry, thereby expanding the frontiers of interdisciplinary research.",

    "abstract": "Key-exfiltration attacks on cryptographic keys are a significant threat to computer security. One proposed defense against such attacks is big-key cryptography which seeks to make cryptographic secrets so large that it is infeasible for an adversary to exfiltrate the key (without being detected). However, this also introduces an inconvenience to the user who must now store the large key on all of their different devices. The work of D\u00f6ttling, Garg, Sekar and Wang (TCC 2022) introduces an elegant solution to this problem in the form of big-key identity-based encryption (IBE). Here, there is a large master secret key, but very short identity keys. The user can now store the large master secret key as her long-term key, and can provision each of her devices with short ephemeral identity keys (say, corresponding to the current date). In this way, the long-term secret key is protected by conventional big-key cryptography, while the user only needs to distribute short ephemeral keys to their different devices. D\u00f6ttling et al. introduce and construct big-key IBE from standard pairing-based assumptions. However, their scheme only satisfies selective security where the adversary has to declare its challenge set of identities at the beginning of the security game. The more natural notion of security is adaptive security where the user can adaptively choose which identities it wants to challenge after seeing the public parameters (and part of the master secret key).\r\n\r\nIn this work, we give the first adaptively-secure construction of big-key IBE from standard cryptographic assumptions. Our first construction relies on indistinguishability obfuscation (and one-way functions), while our second construction relies on witness encryption for NP together with standard pairing-based assumptions (i.e., the SXDH assumption). To prove adaptive security, we show how to implement the classic dual-system methodology with indistinguishability obfuscation as well as witness encryption.",

    "abstract": "In lattice-based cryptography, many attacks are performed by finding a short enough vector on a specific lattice. However, it is possible that length is not the only restriction on the vector to be found. A typical example is SVP with infinity norm: since most SVP solving algorithms only aim to find short vector under Euclidean norm, the infinity norm is in fact another restriction on the vector. In the literature, such problems are usually solved by performing exhaustive search on a list of short vectors generated from lattice sieving. However, the sieving list might either be too large or too small to pass the additional restriction, which makes the solving algorithm inefficient in some cases.\r\n\r\nOur contribution in this work is as follows: (1) We formally define a new lattice hard problem called restricted SVP, and show that it can be used to generalize many lattice hard problems, including SVP with non-Euclidean norm and Kannan's embedding on approximate CVP. (2) We extend the dimension for free technique and the enumerate-then-slice technique into approximate SVP where the goal is to output a list of short vectors with a certain size. (3) We give the heuristic algorithm for solving restricted SVP, and design a hardness estimator for this algorithm, which can be used to estimate the concrete hardness of signature forgery in Dilithium and other lattice-based signatures. Using this estimator, we present a concrete security analysis for Dilithium against signature forgery under the gate-count model for the first time. Our estimation matches well with the security estimation from core-SVP model in the document of Dilithium, and we also combine our estimator with the rescaling technique to generate a tighter estimation.",

    "abstract": "The Ethereum Global Network (EGN) is the peer-to-peer (P2P) network underlying Ethereum and thousands of subsequent blockchain services. Deviating from traditional single-service P2P networks, EGN's multi-service architecture has gained widespread acceptance for supposedly improving node discovery efficiency and security. This paper challenges this belief by critically examining EGN's design and its purported benefits. Our analysis reveals significant shortcomings in EGN's node discovery process. EGN nodes struggle to connect with peers offering the desired service: over three-quarters of connection attempts reach nodes of other services. In an extreme case, one node spent an average of $45\\,908$ connection attempts to find each neighbor. Moreover, this blended architecture compromises EGN's security. The network demonstrates high susceptibility to DHT pollution and partition attacks. Even with only $300$ malicious nodes in EGN, an attacker can isolate thousands of nodes, significantly hindering recovery. In contrast, such a small number of malicious nodes has minimal impact on every single-service P2P network. We propose solutions to improve EGN's node discovery efficiency and strengthen its resilience against attacks.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we present for the first time a cross-core Prime+Probe attack on ARM\r\nTrustZone, which bypasses the AutoLock mechanism. We introduce our simulation-\r\ndriven methodology based on gem5 for vulnerability analysis. We demonstrate its\r\nutility in reverse engineering a SoC platform in order to study its microarchitectural\r\nbehavior (caches, etc.), inside a simulator, in spite of hardware protection. We present\r\na novel vulnerability analysis technique, which takes into account the cache set\r\noccupancy for targeted victim executable. This proves to be essential in identifying\r\ninformation leakage in presence of AutoLock. The above tool also identifies the cache\r\nlines leaking a maximum amount of information. A cross-core Prime+Probe attack is\r\nthen mounted on these max-leakage cache lines both in simulation for fine-tuning,\r\nand in real hardware. We validate our analysis and attack method on OP-TEE, an\r\nopen-source trusted execution environment running on RockPi4 a board based on\r\nRK3399 SoC. More specifically we target the RSA subroutine in the MbedTLS library\r\nused inside OP-TEE. Despite the presence of AutoLock, multiplier obfuscation, and\r\nassuming a cross-core attack, we are able to retrieve 30% of the key bits, which can\r\nlater be used in Branch-and-Prune methods to recover the full key.",

    "abstract": "Secure graph computation enables computing on graphs while hiding the graph topology as well as the associated node/edge data. This facilitates collaborative analysis among multiple data owners, who may only hold a private partial view of the global graph. Several works address this problem using the technique of secure multiparty computation (MPC) in the presence of 2 or 3 parties. However, when moving to the multiparty setting, as required for collaborative analysis among multiple data owners, these solutions are no longer scalable. This remains true with respect to the state-of-the-art framework of $\\mathsf{Graphiti}$ (Koti et al., CCS 2024) as well. Specifically, $\\mathsf{Graphiti}$ incurs a round complexity linear in the number of parties or data owners. This is due to its reliance on secure shuffle protocol, constituting a bottleneck in the multiparty setting. Additionally, $\\mathsf{Graphiti}$ has a prohibitively expensive initialisation phase due to its reliance on secure sort, with a round complexity dependent on both the graph size and the number of parties. \r\n\r\nWe propose $\\mathsf{emGraph}$, a generic framework for secure graph computation in the multiparty setting that eliminates the need of shuffle and instead, relies on a weaker primitive known as $\\mathsf{Permute+Share}$. Further $\\mathsf{emGraph}$ is designed to have a lightweight initialisation, that eliminates the need for sorting, making its round complexity independent of the graph size and number of parties. Unlike any of the prior works, achieving a round complexity independent of the number of parties is what makes $\\mathsf{emGraph}$ scalable.\r\n\r\nFinally, we implement and benchmark the performance of $\\mathsf{emGraph}$ for the application of PageRank computation and showcase its efficiency and scalability improvements over $\\mathsf{Graphiti}$. Concretely, we witness improvements of up to $80\\times$ in runtime in comparison to state-of-the-art framework $\\mathsf{Graphiti}$. Further, we observe that $\\mathsf{emGraph}$ takes under a minute to perform 10 iterations of PageRank computation on a graph of size $10^6$ that is distributed among $25$ parties/data owners, making it highly practical for secure graph computation in the multiparty setting.",

    "abstract": "Bitcoin script cannot easily access and store state information onchain without an upgrade such as BIP-347 (OP_CAT); this makes performing general (stateful) computation on Bitcoin impossible to do directly. Despite this limitation, several approaches have been proposed to bypass it, with BitVM being by far the most production-ready of them. BitVM enables fraud-proof-based computation on Bitcoin, relying on a $1$-out-of-$n$ honesty assumption.\r\n\r\nThis left the question of whether it is possible to achieve computation under the same honesty assumption without requiring onlookers to ensure validity through fraud proofs.  In this note, we answer this question affirmatively by introducing ColliderVM, a new approach for performing computation on Bitcoin today. Crucially, this approach eliminates some capital inefficiency concerns stemming from reliance on fraud proofs.\r\n\r\nFor our construction, a key point is to replace the Lamport or Winternitz signature-based storage component in contemporary protocols with a hash collision-based commitment. With it, we estimate that the Bitcoin script length for STARK proof verification is drastically shorter than that for other pairing-based proof systems used today in applications.",

    "abstract": "The modern internet relies heavily on centralized trust systems controlled by corporations, governments, and intermediaries to manage authentication, identity, and value transfer. These models introduce fundamental vulnerabilities, including censorship, fraud, and systemic insecurity. The Decentralized State Machine (DSM) addresses these issues by introducing a mathematically enforced trust layer that eliminates the need for consensus mechanisms, third-party validators, and centralized infrastructure. DSM enables quantum-resistant, deterministic state transitions for digital identity and value exchange\u2014offering immediate finality, offline capability, and tamper-proof forward-only state progression.\r\n\r\nDSM replaces traditional blockchain execution models with deterministic, pre-committed state transitions, enabling secure, multi-path workflows without requiring Turing-completeness or global consensus. The protocol architecture is based on a straight hash chain with sparse indexing and Sparse Merkle Trees (SMTs), ensuring efficient verification, scalability, and privacy. A bilateral isolation model supports asynchronous, offline operation with built-in consistency guarantees. DSM introduces a sustainable, gas-free economic model based on cryptographic subscription commitments.\r\n\r\nThis paper outlines the architecture, cryptographic foundations, and security guarantees of DSM, and demonstrates how it achieves verifiable, trustless interaction between peers\u2014both online and offline. By decoupling security from consensus and enabling self-validating state transitions, DSM offers a practical and scalable alternative to conventional internet trust models.",

    "abstract": "An oblivious RAM (ORAM) compiler is a cryptographic tool that transforms a program $P$ running in time $n$ into an equivalent program $\\tilde P$, with the property that the sequence of memory addresses read from/written to by $\\tilde P$ reveal nothing about $\\tilde P$'s data (Goldreich and Ostrovsky, JACM'96). An efficient ORAM compiler $C$ should achieve some combination of the following:\r\n\r\n- Low bandwidth blow-up: $\\tilde P$ should read/write a similar amount of data as does P.\r\n- Low latency: $\\tilde P$ should incur a similar number of roundtrips to the memory as does P.\r\n- Low space complexity: $\\tilde P$ should run in as few words of local memory as possible.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that for a generic compiler (i.e. one that works for any RAM program $P$), certain combinations of efficiencies are impossible. Any generic ORAM compiler must incur $\\Omega(\\log n)$ bandwidth blow-up, and any ORAM compiler with no latency blow-up must incur either $\\Omega(\\sqrt n)$ bandwidth blow-up and/or local space. Moreover, while a $O(\\log n)$ bandwidth blow-up compiler is known, it requires the assumption that one-way functions exist and incurs enormous constant factors.\r\n\r\nTo circumvent the above problems and improve efficiency of particular ORAM programs, we develop a compiler for a specific class of programs. Let $P$ be a program that interacts with an immutable memory. Namely, $P$ may write values to memory, then read them back, but it cannot change values that were already written. Using only information-theoretic techniques, we compile any such $P$ into an oblivious form $\\tilde P$ with a combination of efficiencies that no generic ORAM compiler can achieve:\r\n\r\n- $\\tilde P$ incurs $\\Theta(\\log n)$ amortized bandwidth blow-up.\r\n- $\\tilde P$ incurs $O(1)$ amortized latency blow-up.\r\n- $\\tilde P$ runs in $O(\\lambda)$ words of local space ($\\tilde P$ incurs an error with probability $2^{-\\Omega(\\lambda)}$).\r\n\r\nWe show that this, for instance, implies that any pure functional program can be compiled with the same asymptotics.\r\n\r\nOur work builds on and is compatible with prior work  (Appan et al., CCS'24) that showed similar results for pointer machine programs that manipulate objects with constant in-degree (i.e., the program may only maintain a constant number of pointers to any one memory cell; our immutable memory approach does not have this limitation). By combining techniques, we can consider programs that interact with a mixed memory that allows each memory cell to be updated until it is frozen, after which it becomes immutable, allowing further reads to be compiled with the above asymptotics, even when in-degree is high. Many useful algorithms/data structures can be naturally implemented as mixed memory programs, including suffix trees (powerful data structures used in computational biology) and deterministic finite automata (DFAs).",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present efficient SNARKs for Boolean circuits, achieving significant improvements in the prover efficiency. The core of our technique is a novel tower sumcheck protocol and a tower zero-check protocol tailored for tower fields, which enable this efficiency boost. When instantiated with Wiedemann's binary tower fields with the base field of $GF(2)$ and the top-level field $GF(2^{2^\\ell})$, assuming the quadratic complexity of multiplications \\(O(2^{2\\ell})\\) in the top-level field with $2^\\ell$ bits, the prover time of our sumcheck protocol is \\(O(2^{1.5\\ell}N)\\). It is faster than the standard sumcheck protocol over the large field with the complexity of \\(O(2^{2\\ell}N)\\). To achieve a reasonable security level, $2^\\ell$ is usually set to $128$.\r\n\r\nLeveraging this advancement, we improve the efficiency of IOP protocols over the binary or small characteristic fields for Plonkish, CCS, and GKR-based constraint systems. Moreover, to further improve the prover efficiency of the SNARKs, we introduce a basis-switching mechanism that efficiently transforms polynomial evaluations on the base-field polynomial to evaluations on the tower-field polynomial. With the basis-switching, we are able to compile the binary-field IOPs to SNARKs using large-field polynomial commitment schemes (PCS) that batch the witness over the base field. The size of the large-field PCS is only $\\frac{1}{2^\\ell}$ of the size of the witness over the base field. Combining the IOP and the PCS, the overall prover time of our SNARKs for Boolean circuits significantly faster than the naive approach of encoding Boolean values in a large field.",

    "abstract": "In CRYPTO 2022, Esser et al. proposed a partial key exposure attack on several post-quantum cryptographic schemes including Rainbow which is a variant of UOV. The task of the attack is to recover a full secret key from its partial information such as a secret key with symmetric/asymmetric bit errors. One of the techniques Esser et al. developed is a partial enumeration that combines the standard algorithms to solve the MQ problem with enumeration. \r\n\r\nAlthough an efficient attack on Rainbow was proposed, UOV and its variants have still been paid much attention since UOV and its three variants, i.e., MAYO, QR-UOV and SNOVA, were selected as the Round 2 candidates of the additional call for digital signature schemes proposal by NIST. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we analyze partial key exposure attacks on UOV, MAYO, and QR-UOV. Although our proposed attacks use the partial enumeration, we refine their enumeration strategy. We employ two enumeration strategies and analyze the complexity of the proposed attacks. Then, we find a structural difference between UOV and its variants to resist partial enumeration. Specifically, the partial enumeration is effective if the number of vinegar variables is smaller than the number of equations and the order of a finite field is small. \r\n\r\nAs a result, the proposed attack is the most effective on MAYO. While our attacks on UOV and QR-UOV are effective only when the symmetric error probabilities are 0.11 and 0.05, respectively, that on MAYO is effective even when the probability is close to 0.5.",

    "abstract": "The matrix code equivalence problem consists, given two matrix spaces $\\mathcal{C},\\mathcal{D}\\subset \\mathbb{F}_q^{m\\times n}$ of dimension $k$, in finding invertible matrices $P\\in\\textrm{GL}_m(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ and $Q\\in\\textrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ such that $\\mathcal{D} =P\\mathcal{C} Q^{-1}$. Recent signature schemes such as MEDS and ALTEQ relate their security to the hardness of this problem. Naranayan et. al. recently published an algorithm solving this problem in the case $k = n =m$ in $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(q^{\\frac k 2})$ operations. We present a different algorithm which solves the problem in the general case. Our approach consists in reducing the problem to the matrix code conjugacy problem, i.e. the case $P=Q$. For the latter problem, similarly to the permutation code equivalence problem in Hamming metric, a natural invariant based on the \\emph{Hull} of the code can be used. Next, the equivalence of codes can be deduced using a usual list collision argument. For $k=m=n$, our algorithm achieves the same complexity as in the aforementioned reference. However, it extends to a much broader range of parameters.",

    "abstract": "More and more people take advantage of mobile apps to strike up relationships and casual contacts. This sometimes results in the sharing of self-generated nudes. While this opens a way for sexual exploration, it also raises concerns. In this paper, we review existing technology-assisted permissive proposals/features that provide security or privacy benefits when sharing nudes online. To do so, we performed a systematic literature review combing through 10,026 search results and cross-references, and we identified real-world solutions by surveying OS features and 52 dating, messaging and social network apps. We systematized knowledge by defining a sexting threat model, deriving a taxonomy of the proposals/features, discussing some of their shortcomings, organizing privacy-related concepts, and providing take-aways with some directions for future research and development. Our study found a very diverse ecosystem of academic proposals and app features, showing that safer sexting goes far beyond nude detection. None of the techniques represents the ultimate solution for all threats, but each contributes to safer sexting in a different way.",

    "abstract": "We give an IOPP (interactive oracle proof of proximity) for trivariate Reed-Muller codes that achieves  the best known query complexity in some range of security parameters. Specifically, for degree $d$ and security parameter $\\lambda\\leq \\frac{\\log^2 d}{\\log\\log d}$  , our IOPP has $2^{-\\lambda}$ round-by-round soundness, $O(\\lambda)$ queries, $O(\\log\\log d)$ rounds and $O(d)$ length. This improves upon the FRI [Ben-Sasson, Bentov, Horesh, Riabzev, ICALP 2018] and the STIR [Arnon, Chiesa, Fenzi, Yogev, Crypto 2024] IOPPs for Reed-Solomon codes, that have larger query and round complexity standing at $O(\\lambda \\log d)$ and  $O(\\log d+\\lambda\\log\\log d)$ respectively. We use our IOPP to give an IOP for the NP-complete language Rank-1-Constraint-Satisfaction with the same parameters.\r\n\r\n    Our construction is based on the line versus point test in the low-soundness regime. Compared to the axis parallel test (which is used in all prior works), the general affine lines test has improved soundness, which is the main source of our improved soundness.  \r\n    \r\n    Using this test involves several complications, most significantly that projection to affine lines does not preserve individual degrees, and we show how to overcome these difficulties. En route, we extend some existing machinery to more general settings. Specifically, we give proximity generators for Reed-Muller codes, show a more systematic way of handling \"side conditions\" in IOP constructions, and generalize the compiling procedure of [Arnon, Chiesa, Fenzi, Yogev, Crypto 2024] to general codes.",

    "abstract": "The transition to quantum-safe public-key cryptography has begun: for key agreement, NIST has standardized ML-KEM and selected HQC for future standardization. The relative immaturity of these schemes encourages crypto-agile implementations, to facilitate easy transitions between them. Intelligent crypto-agility requires efficient sharing strategies to compute operations from different cryptosystems using the same resources. This is particularly challenging for cryptosystems with distinct mathematical foundations, like lattice-based ML-KEM and code-based HQC.\r\nWe introduce PHOENIX, the first crypto-agile hardware coprocessor for lattice- and code-based cryptosystems--specifically, ML-KEM and HQC, at all three NIST security levels--with an effective agile sharing strategy.\r\nPHOENIX accelerates polynomial multiplication, which is the main operation in both cryptosystems, and the current bottleneck of HQC. To maximise sharing, we replace HQC's Karatsuba-based polynomial multiplication with the Frobenius Additive FFT (FAFFT), which is similar on an abstract level to ML-KEM's Number Theoretic Transform (NTT). \r\nWe show that the FAFFT already brings substantial performance improvements in software. In hardware, our sharing strategy for the FAFFT and NTT is based on a new SuperButterfly unit that seamlessly switches between these two FFT variants over completely different rings. This is, to our knowledge, the first FAFFT hardware accelerator of any kind. We have integrated PHOENIX in a real System-on-Chip FPGA scenario, where our performance measurements show that efficient crypto-agility for lattice- and code-based KEMs can be achieved with low overhead.",

    "abstract": "Sanitizable Signature Schemes (SSS) enable a designated party, the sanitizer, to modify predefined parts of a signed message without invalidating the signature, making them useful for applications like pseudonymization and redaction. Since their introduction by Ateniese et al. (ESORICS'05), several classical SSS constructions have been proposed, but none have been instantiated from quantum-resistant assumptions. In this work, we develop the first quantum-secure sanitizable signature schemes based on lattice assumptions. Our primary focus is on SSS constructions that rely on chameleon hash functions (CHFs), a key component for enabling the controlled modification of messages. While lattice-based CHFs exist, they do not meet the required security guarantees for SSS, becoming insecure under adversarial access to an adapt oracle. To address this, we construct a novel lattice-based CHF that achieves collision resistance even in such settings, called full collision resistance. However, our CHF lacks the uniqueness property, a limitation we show to be inherent in lattice-based CHFs. As a result, our SSS constructions initially fall short of achieving the critical security property of accountability. To overcome this, we apply a transformation based on verifiable ring signatures (VRS), for which we present the first lattice-based instantiation. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of existing classical SSS constructions, explore their potential for post-quantum instantiations, and present new attacks on previously assumed secure SSS schemes. Our work closes the gap in constructing quantum-secure SSS and lays the groundwork for further research into advanced cryptographic primitives based on lattice assumptions.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the Byzantine Agreement problem in synchronous systems where Byzantine agents can move from process to process, corrupting their host. \r\nWe focus on three representative models: \\emph{Garay's}, \\emph{Bonnet's} and \\emph{Buhrman's} models.\r\nIn \\emph{Garay's model} when a process has been left by the Byzantine, it is in the \\emph{cured} state and it is aware of its condition and thus can remain silent for a round to prevent the dissemination of wrong information.\r\nIn \\emph{Bonnet's model} a cured process may send messages (based on a state corrupted by the malicious agent), however it will behave correctly in the way it sends those messages: i.e., send messages according to the algorithm.\r\nIn \\emph{Buhrman's model} Byzantine agents move together with the message.  \r\nIt has been shown that in order to solve Byzantine Agreement in the \\emph{Garay's model} at least $4t+1$ processors are needed, for \\emph{Bonnet's model} at least $5t+1$ processors are needed, while for \\emph{Buhrman's model} at least $3t+1$ processors are needed.\r\nIn this paper we target to increase the tolerance to mobile Byzantines by integrating a trusted counter abstraction to the above models. This abstraction prevents nodes to equivocate. In the new models we prove that at least $3t+1$, respectively $4t+1$, and $2t+1$ processors are needed  to tolerate $t$ mobile Byzantine agents. Furthermore,  we propose novel Mobile Byzantine Agreement algorithms that  match these new lower bounds for \\emph{Garay's}, \\emph{Bonnet's} and \\emph{Buhrman's} models.",

    "abstract": "Laconic cryptography focuses on designing two-message protocols that allow secure computation on large datasets while minimizing communication costs. While laconic cryptography protocols achieve asymptotically optimal communication complexity for many tasks, their concrete efficiency is prohibitively expensive due to the heavy use of public-key techniques or the non-black-box of cryptographic primitives.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we initiate the study of \"laconic cryptography with preprocessing\", introducing a model that includes an offline phase to generate database-dependent correlations, which are then used in a lightweight online phase. These correlations are conceptually simple, relying on linear-algebraic techniques. This enables us to develop a protocol for private laconic vector oblivious linear evaluation (plvOLE). In such a protocol, the receiver holds a large database $\\mathsf{DB}$, and the sender has two messages $v$ and $w$, along with an index $i$. The receiver learns the value $v \\cdot \\mathsf{DB}_i + w$ without revealing other information.\r\n\r\nOur protocol, which draws from ideas developed in the context of private information retrieval with preprocessing, serves as the backbone for two applications of interest: laconic private set intersection (lPSI) for large universes and laconic function evaluation for RAM-programs (RAM-LFE). Based our plvOLE protocol, we provide efficient instantiations of these two primitives in the preprocessing model.",

    "abstract": "The security of ML-DSA, like most signature schemes, is partially based on the fact that the nonce used to generate the signature is unknown to any attacker. In this work, we exhibit a lattice-based attack that is possible if the nonces share implicit or explicit information. From a collection of signatures whose nonces share certain coefficients, it is indeed possible to build a collection of non full-rank lattices. Intersecting them, we show how to create a low-rank lattice that contains one of the polynomials of the secret key, which in turn can be recovered using lattice reduction techniques. \r\n\r\nThere are several interpretations of this result: firstly, it can be seen as a generalization of a fault-based attack on BLISS presented at SAC'16 by Thomas Espitau et al. Alternatively, it can be understood as a side-channel attack on ML-DSA, in the case where an attacker is able to recover only one of the coefficients of the nonce used during the generation of the signature. For ML-DSA-II, we show that $4 \\times 160$ signatures and few hours of computation are sufficient to recover the secret key on a desktop computer. Lastly, our result shows that simple countermeasures, such as permuting the generation of the nonce coefficients, are not sufficient.",

    "abstract": "Physically Unclonable Constants (PUCs) are a special type of Physically Unclonable Constants and they can be used to embed secret bit-strings in chips. Most PUCs are an array of cells where each cell is a digital circuit that evolve spontaneously toward one of two states, the chosen state being function of random manufacturing process variations. In this paper we propose an Analog Physically Unclonable Constant (APUC) whose output is an analog value to be transformed in digital by a digitizer circuit. The ratio behind this proposal is that an APUC cell has the potential of providing more than one bit, reducing the required footprint. Preliminary theoretical analysis and simulation results are presented. The proposed APUC has interesting performances (e.g., it can provide up to 5 bits per cell) that grant for further investigation.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents new results that establish connections between isogeny graphs and nonlinear recurrences over finite fields. Specifically, we prove several theorems that link these two areas, offering deeper insights into the structure of isogeny graphs and their relationship with nonlinear recurrence sequences. We further provide two related conjectures which may be worth of further research. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the endomorphism ring of a curve, advancing progress toward the resolution of the Endomorphism Ring Problem, which aims to provide a computational characterization of the endomorphism ring of a supersingular elliptic curve.",

    "abstract": "A Random Oracle Combiner (ROC), introduced by Dodis et al. (CRYPTO \u201922), takes two hash functions $h_1, h_2$ from m bits to n bits and outputs a new hash function $C$ from $m$' to $n$' bits. This function C is guaranteed to be indifferentiable from a fresh random oracle as long as one of $h_1$ and $h_2$ (say, $h_1$) is a random oracle, while the other h2 can \u201carbitrarily depend\u201d on $h_1$.\r\n\r\nThe work of Dodis et al. also built the first length-preserving ROC, where $n$\u2032 = $n$. Unfortunately, despite this feasibility result, this construction has several deficiencies. From the practical perspective, it could not be directly applied to existing Merkle-Damg\u00e5rd-based hash\r\nfunctions, such as SHA2 or SHA3. From the theoretical perspective, it required $h_1$ and $h_2$ to have input length $m$ > 3\u03bb, where \u03bb is the security parameter.\r\n\r\nTo overcome these limitations, Dodis et al. conjectured \u2014 and left as the main open question \u2014 that the following (salted) construction is a length-preserving ROC:\r\n\r\n$C^{h1,h2}_{\\mathcal{Z}_1,\\mathcal{Z}_2} (M ) = h_1^*(M, \\mathcal{Z}_1) \\oplus h^*_2(M,\\mathcal{Z}_2),$\r\n\r\nwhere $\\mathcal{Z}_1, \\mathcal{Z}_2$ are random salts of appropriate length, and $f^*$ denotes the Merkle-Damg\u00e5rd-extension of a given compression function $f$. As our main result, we resolve this conjecture in the affirmative. For practical use, this makes the resulting combiner applicable to existing, Merkle-Damg\u00e5rd-based hash functions. On the theory side, it shows the existence of ROCs only requiring optimal input length $m$ = \u03bb+O(1).",

    "abstract": "CRLite is a low-bandwidth, low-latency, privacy-preserving mechanism for distributing certificate revocation data. A CRLite aggregator periodically encodes revocation data into a compact static hash set, or membership test, which can can be downloaded by clients and queried privately. We present a novel data-structure for membership tests, which we call a clubcard, and we evaluate the encoding efficiency of clubcards using data from Mozilla's CRLite infrastructure.\r\n\r\nAs of November 2024, the WebPKI contains over 900 million valid certificates and over 8 million revoked certificates. We describe an instantiation of CRLite that encodes the revocation status of these certificates in a 6.7 MB package. This is $54\\%$ smaller than the original instantiation of CRLite presented at the 2017 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, and it is $21\\%$ smaller than the lower bound claimed in that work.\r\n\r\nA sequence of clubcards can encode a dynamic dataset like the WebPKI revocation set. Using data from late 2024 again, we find that clubcards encoding 6 hour delta updates to the WebPKI can be compressed to 26.8 kB on average---a size that makes CRLite truly practical.\r\n\r\nWe have extended Mozilla's CRLite infrastructure so that it can generate clubcards, and we have added client-side support for this system to Firefox. We report on some performance aspects of our implementation, which is currently the default revocation checking mechanism in Firefox Nightly, and we propose strategies for further reducing the bandwidth requirements of CRLite.",

    "abstract": "Recently, $\\mathsf{NTRU}$+$\\mathsf{Sign}$ was proposed as a new compact signature scheme, following `Fiat-Shamir with Aborts' (FSwA) framework. Its compactness is mainly based on their novel NTRU-based key structure that fits well with bimodal distributions in the FSwA framework. However, despite its compactness, $\\mathsf{NTRU}$+$\\mathsf{Sign}$ fails to provide a diverse set of parameters that can meet some desired security levels. This limitation stems from its reliance on a ring $\\mathbb{Z}_q[x]/\\langle x^n+1 \\rangle$, where $n$ is restricted to powers of two, limiting the flexibility in selecting appropriate security levels. To overcome this limitation, we propose a revised version of $\\mathsf{NTRU}$+$\\mathsf{Sign}$ by adopting a ring $\\mathbb{Z}_q[x]/\\langle x^n-x^{n/2}+1\\rangle$ from cyclotomic trinomials, where $n=2^{i}3^{j}$ for some positive integers $i$ and $j$. Our parameterization offers three distinct security levels: approximately $120$, $190$, and $260$ bits, while preserving the compactness in $\\mathbb{Z}_q[x]/\\langle x^n+1 \\rangle$. We implement these re-parameterized $\\mathsf{NTRU}$+$\\mathsf{Sign}$ schemes, showing that the performance of $\\mathsf{NTRU}$+$\\mathsf{Sign}$ from cyclotomic trinomials is still comparable to previous lattice-based signature schemes such as $\\mathsf{Dilithium}$ and $\\mathsf{HAETAE}$.",

    "abstract": "Semantic communication systems, which focus on transmitting the semantics of data rather than its exact reconstruction, redefine the design of communication networks for transformative efficiency in bandwidth-limited and latency-critical applications. Addressing these goals, we tackle the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) problem for image compression, a critical challenge in achieving perceptually realistic reconstructions under rate constraints. Formulated within the randomized distributed function computation (RDFC) framework, we establish an achievable non-asymptotic RDP region, providing finite blocklength trade-offs between rate, distortion, and perceptual quality, aligning with semantic communication objectives. We extend this region to also include a secrecy constraint, providing strong secrecy guarantees against eavesdroppers via physical-layer security methods, ensuring resilience against quantum attacks. Our contributions include (i) establishing achievable bounds for non-asymptotic RDP regions under realism and distortion constraints; (ii) extending these bounds to provide strong secrecy guarantees; (iii) characterizing the asymptotic secure RDP region under a perfect realism constraint; and (iv) illustrating significant reductions in rates and the effects of secrecy constraints and finite blocklengths. Our results provide actionable insights for designing low-latency, high-fidelity, and secure image compression systems with realistic outputs, advancing applications, e.g., in privacy-critical domains.",

    "abstract": "Secure two-party computation (2PC) enables two parties to jointly evaluate a function while maintaining input privacy. Despite recent significant progress, a notable efficiency gap remains between actively secure and passively secure protocols. In S\\&P'12, Huang, Katz, and Evans formalized the notion of \\emph{active security with one-bit leakage}, providing a promising approach to bridging this gap. Protocols derived from this notion have become foundational in designing highly efficient actively secure 2PC protocols. However, a critical challenge identified by Huang, Katz, and Evans remains unexplored: these protocols face significant weaknesses in ensuring fairness for honest parties when employed in standalone settings rather than as components within larger protocols. While the authors proposed two potential solutions to mitigate this issue, both approaches are prohibitively expensive and lack formalization of security guarantees.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we first formally define an enhanced notion called \\emph{active security with one-bit-advantage bound}, in which the adversaries' advantages are strictly bounded to at most one bit beyond what honest parties obtain. This bound is enforced through a \\emph{progressive revelation} mechanism, where the evaluation result is disclosed incrementally bit by bit. In addition, we propose a novel approach leveraging label structures within garbled circuits to design a highly efficient constant-round 2PC protocol that achieves active security with one-bit advantage bound. Our protocol demonstrates \\emph{runtime performance nearly identical to that of passively secure garbled-circuit counterparts} in duplex networks (\\eg $1.033\\times$ for the {\\tt SHA256} circuit in LAN), with \\emph{low overhead} for output progressive revelation (only $80$ communicated bytes per bit release).\r\n\r\nWith its strengthened security guarantees and minimal overhead, our protocol is highly suitable for practical 2PC applications.",

    "abstract": "Weightwise degree-$d$ functions are Boolean functions that, on each set of fixed Hamming weight, coincide with a function of degree at most $d$. They generalize both symmetric functions and the Hidden Weight Bit Function (HWBF), which has been studied in cryptography for its favorable properties. \r\nIn this work, we establish a general upper bound on the algebraic immunity of such functions, a key security parameter against algebraic attacks on stream ciphers like filtered Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs). We construct explicit low-degree annihilators for WWdd functions with small $d$, and show how to generalize these constructions. As an application, we prove that the algebraic immunity of the HWBF is upper bounded by $3\\sqrt{n}$ disproving a result from 2011 that claimed a lower bound of $n/3$. We then apply our technique to several generalizations of the HWBF proposed since 2021 for homomorphically friendly constructions and LFSR-based ciphers, refining or refuting results from six prior works.",

    "abstract": "A set of unacquainted  parties, some of which may misbehave, communicate with each other over an unauthenticated and unreliable gossip network. They wish to jointly replicate a state machine $\\Pi$ so that each one of them has fair access to its operation. Specifically, assuming parties' computational power is measured as queries to an oracle machine $H(\\cdot)$, parties can issue symbols to the state machine in proportion to their queries to $H(\\cdot)$ at a given fixed rate. Moreover, if such access to the state machine is provided continuously in expected constant time installments we qualify it as fast fairness.\r\n\r\nA state machine replication (SMR) protocol in this permissionless setting is expected to offer consistency across parties and reliably process all symbols that honest parties wish to add to it in a timely manner despite  continuously fluctuating participation and in the presence of an adversary who commands less than half of the total queries to $H(\\cdot)$ per unit of time.\r\n\r\nA number of protocols strive to offer the above guarantee together with fast settlement  \u2014 notably, the Bitcoin blockchain offers a protocol that settles against Byzantine adversaries in polylogarithmic rounds, while fairness only holds in a fail-stop adversarial model (due to the fact that Byzantine behavior can bias access to the state machine in the adversary's favor). In this work, we put forth the first Byzantine-resilient protocol solving SMR in this setting with both expected-constant-time settlement and fast fairness. In addition, our protocol is self-sufficient in the sense of performing its own time keeping while tolerating an adaptively fluctuating set of parties.",

    "abstract": "Side-channel attacks consist of retrieving internal data from a victim system by analyzing its leakage, which usually requires proximity to the victim in the range of a few millimetres.\r\nScreaming channels are EM side channels transmitted at a distance of a few meters. \r\nThey appear on mixed-signal devices integrating an RF module on the same silicon die as the digital part.\r\nConsequently, the side channels are modulated by legitimate RF signal carriers and appear at the harmonics of the digital clock frequency.\r\nWhile initial works have only considered collecting leakage at these harmonics, late work has demonstrated that the leakage is also present at frequencies other than these harmonics.\r\nThis result significantly increases the number of available frequencies to perform a screaming-channel attack, which can be convenient in an environment where multiple harmonics are polluted.\r\nThis work studies how this diversity of frequencies carrying leakage can be used to improve attack performance.\r\nWe first study how to combine multiple frequencies.\r\nSecond, we demonstrate that frequency combination can improve attack performance and evaluate this improvement according to the performance of the combined frequencies.\r\nFinally, we demonstrate the interest of frequency combination in attacks at $15$ and, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, at $30$ meters. \r\nOne last important observation is that this frequency combination divides by $2$ the number of traces needed to reach a given attack performance.",

    "abstract": "Modern life makes having a digital identity no longer optional, whether one needs to manage a bank account or subscribe to a newspaper. As the number of online services increases, it is fundamental to safeguard user privacy and equip service providers (SP) with mechanisms enforcing Sybil resistance, i.e., preventing a single entity from showing as many. \r\n  Current approaches, such as anonymous credentials and self-sovereign identities, typically rely on identity providers or identity registries trusted not to track users' activities. However, this assumption of trust is no longer appropriate in a world where user data is considered a valuable asset. \r\n  To address this challenge, we introduce a new cryptographic notion, Anonymous Self-Credentials (ASC) along with two implementations. This approach enables users to maintain their privacy within an anonymity set while allowing SPs to obtain Sybil resistance. Then, we present a User-issued Unlinkable Single Sign-On (U2SSO) implemented from ASC that solely relies on an identity registry to immutably store identities. A U2SSO solution allows users to generate unlinkable child credentials for each SP using only one set of master credentials.\r\n  We demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of our U2SSO solution by providing a complete proof-of-concept.",

    "abstract": "eIDAS 2.0 (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services) is a very ambitious regulation aimed at equipping European citizens with a personal digital identity wallet (EU Digital Identity Wallet) on a mobile phone that not only needs to achieve a high level of security, but also needs to be available as soon as possible for a large number of citizens and respect their privacy (as per GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation).  \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce the foundations of a digital identity wallet solution that could help move closer to this objective by leveraging the proven anonymous credentials system BBS (Eurocrypt 2023), also known as BBS+, but modifying it to avoid the limitations that have hindered its widespread adoption, especially in certified infrastructures requiring trusted hardware implementation.  \r\nIn particular, the solution we propose, which we call BBS#, does not rely, contrary to BBS/BBS +, on bilinear maps and pairing-friendly curves (which are not supported by existing hardware) and only depends on the hardware implementation of well-known digital signature schemes such as ECDSA (ISO/IEC 14888-3) or ECSDSA (also known as ECSchnorr, ISO/IEC 14888-3) using classical elliptic curves. More precisely, BBS# can be rolled out without requiring any change in existing hardware or the algorithms that hardware supports. \r\nBBS# , which is proven secure in the random oracle model, retains the well-known security property (unforgeability of the credentials under the (gap) q-SDH assumption) and anonymity properties (multi-show full unlinkability and statistical anonymity of presentation proofs) of BBS/BBS+. \r\n\r\nBy implementing BBS# on several smartphones using different secure execution environments, we show that it is possible to achieve eIDAS 2.0 transactions which are not only efficient (around 70 ms on Android StrongBox), secure and certifiable at the highest level but also provide strong (optimal) privacy protection for all European ID Wallet users.",

    "abstract": "(Preprint) Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are rapidly gaining importance in privacy-preserving and verifiable computing. ZKPs enable a proving party to prove the truth of a statement to a verifying party without revealing anything else. ZKPs have applications in blockchain technologies, verifiable machine learning, and electronic voting, but have yet to see widespread adoption due to the computational complexity of the proving process.Recent works have accelerated the key primitives of state-of-the-art ZKP protocols on GPU and ASIC. However, the protocols accelerated thus far face one of two challenges: they either require a trusted setup for each application, or they generate larger proof sizes with higher verification costs, limiting their applicability in scenarios with numerous verifiers or strict verification time constraints. This work presents an accelerator, zkSpeed, for HyperPlonk, a state-of-the-art ZKP protocol that supports both one-time, universal setup and small proof sizes for typical ZKP applications in publicly verifiable, consensus-based systems. We accelerate the entire protocol, including two major primitives: SumCheck and Multi-scalar Multiplications (MSMs). We develop a full-chip architecture using 366.46 mm$^2$ and 2 TB/s of bandwidth to accelerate the entire proof generation process, achieving geometric mean speedups of 801$\\times$ over CPU baselines.",

    "abstract": "This work presents SPHINCSLET, the first fully standard-compliant and area-efficient hardware implementation of the SLH-DSA algorithm, formerly known as SPHINCS+, a post-quantum digital signature scheme. SPHINCSLET is designed to be parameterizable across different security levels and hash functions, offering a balanced trade-off between area efficiency and performance. Existing hardware implementations either feature a large area footprint to achieve fast signing and verification or adopt a coprocessor-based approach that significantly slows down these operations. SPHINCSLET addresses this gap by delivering a 4.7$\\times$ reduction in area compared to high-speed designs while achieving a 2.5$\\times$ to 5$\\times$ improvement in signing time over the most efficient coprocessor-based designs for a SHAKE256-based SPHINCS+ implementation. The SHAKE256-based SPHINCS+ FPGA implementation targeting the AMD Artix-7 requires fewer than 10.8K LUTs for any security level of SLH-DSA. Furthermore, the SHA-2-based SPHINCS+ implementation achieves a 2$\\times$ to 4$\\times$ speedup in signature generation across various security levels compared to existing SLH-DSA hardware, all while maintaining a compact area footprint of 6K to 15K LUTs. This makes it the fastest SHA-2-based SLH-DSA implementation to date. With an optimized balance of area and performance, SPHINCSLET can assist resource-constrained devices in transitioning to post-quantum cryptography.",

    "abstract": "Byzantine  Reliable  Broadcast  is  one of the most popular communication  primitives in distributed systems.  Byzantine reliable broadcast ensures that  processes agree to deliver  a  message  from  an initiator, even if some processes (possibly including the initiator) are Byzantine. In asynchronous settings, it is known since the prominent work of Bracha \\cite{Bracha87} that Byzantine  reliable  broadcast can be implemented deterministically if the total number of processes, denoted by $n$, satisfies $n \\geq 3t+1$ where $t$ is an upper bound on the number of Byzantine processes. Here, we study Byzantine Reliable Broadcast when processes are equipped with \\emph{trusted components}, special software or hardware designed to prevent equivocation. Our contribution is threefold. First, we show that, despite common belief, when each process is equipped with a trusted component, Bracha's algorithm still needs $n \\geq 3t+1$. Second, we present a novel algorithm that uses a single trusted component (at the initiator) that implements Byzantine Reliable  Asynchronous Broadcast with $n \\geq 2t+1$. \r\n\\yag{Lastly, building on our broadcast algorithm, we present TenderTee, a transformation of the Tendermint consensus algorithm by using trusted component, giving better Byzantine resilience. Tendertee works with $n \\geq 2t+1$, where Tendermint needed $n=3t+1$.}",

    "abstract": "Set reconciliation is a fundamental task in distributed systems, particularly in blockchain networks, where it enables the synchronization of transaction pools among peers and facilitates block dissemination. Existing traditional set reconciliation schemes are either statistical, providing success probability as a function of the communication overhead and the size of the symmetric difference, or require parametrization and estimation of the size of the symmetric difference, which can be prone to error. In this paper, we present CertainSync, a novel reconciliation framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to guarantee successful set reconciliation without any parametrization or estimators in use. The framework is rateless and adapts to the unknown symmetric difference size. The set reconciliation is guaranteed to be completed successfully whenever the communication overhead reaches a lower bound derived from the symmetric difference size and the universe size. Our framework is based on recent constructions of Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (IBLTs) ensuring successful element listing as long as the number of elements is bounded. We provide a theoretical analysis to prove the certainty in the set reconciliation for multiple constructions. The approach is also validated by simulations, showing the ability to synchronize sets with efficient communication costs while maintaining reconciliation guarantees compared to other baseline schemes for set reconciliation. To further improve communication overhead for large universes as blockchain networks, CertainSync is extended with a universe reduction technique to minimize communication overhead. We compare and validate the extended framework UniverseReduceSync against the basic CertainSync framework through simulations using real blockchain transaction hash data from the Ethereum blockchain network. The results illustrate a trade-off between improved communication costs and maintaining reconciliation guarantees without relying on parametrization or estimators, offering a comprehensive solution for set reconciliation in diverse scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Weyman and Zelevinsky generalised Vandermonde matrices to higher dimensions, which we call Vandermonde-Weyman-Zelevinsky tensors. \r\nWe generalise Lagrange interpolation to higher dimensions by devising a nearly linear time algorithm that given a Vandermonde-Weyman-Zelevinsky tensor and a sparse target vector, finds a tuple of vectors that hit the target under tensor evaluation. Tensor evaluation to us means evaluating the usual multilinear form associated with the tensor in all but one chosen dimension. Yet, this interpolation problem phrased with respect to a random tensor appears to be a hard multilinear system. Leveraging this dichotomy, we propose preimage sampleable trapdoor one-way functions in the spirit of Gentry-Peikert-Vaikuntanathan (GPV) lattice trapdoors. We design and analyse ``Hash-and-Sign'' digital signatures from such trapdoor one-way functions, yielding short signatures whose lengths scale nearly linearly in the security parameter. We also describe an encryption scheme.\r\n\r\nOur trapdoor is a random Vandermonde-Weyman-Zelevinsky tensor over a finite field and a random basis change. We hide the Vandermonde-Weyman-Zelevinsky tensor under the basis change and publish the resulting pseudorandom tensor. The one way function is the tensor evaluation derived from the public tensor, restricted so as to only map to sparse vectors.  We then design the domain sampler and preimage sampler demanded by the GPV framework. The former samples inputs that map to uniform images under the one-way function. The latter samples preimages given supplementary knowledge of the trapdoor. Preimage sampling is a randomised version of interpolation and knowing the basis change allows efficient translation between interpolation corresponding to the public and trapdoor tensors. An adversary seeking a preimage must solve a pseudorandom multilinear system, which seems cryptographically hard.",

    "abstract": "We propose an encrypted controller framework for linear time-invariant systems with actuator non-linearity based on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). While some existing works explore the use of partially homomorphic encryption (PHE) in implementing linear control systems, the impacts of the non-linear behaviors of the actuators on the systems are often left unconcerned. In particular, when the inputs to the controller become too small or too large, actuators may burn out due to unstable system state oscillations. To solve this dilemma, we design and implement FHECAP, an FHE-based controller framework that can homomorphically apply non-linear functions to the actuators to rectify the system inputs. In FHECAP, we first design a novel data encoding scheme tailored for efficient gain matrix evaluation. Then, we propose a high-precision homomorphic algorithm to apply non-arithmetic piecewise function to realize the actuator normalization. In the experiments, compared with the existing state-of-the-art encrypted controllers, FHECAP achieves $4\\times$--$1000\\times$ reduction in computational latency. We evaluate the effectiveness of FHECAP in the real-world application of encrypted control for spacecraft rendezvous. The simulation results show that the FHECAP achieves real-time spacecraft rendezvous with negligible accuracy loss.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing is regarded as one of the most significant upcoming advancements in computer science. \r\nAlthough fully operational quantum computers have yet to be realized, they are expected to solve specific problems that are difficult to solve using classical computers. \r\nGiven the limitations of quantum computing resources, it is crucial to design compact quantum circuits for core operations, such as quantum arithmetic.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we focus on optimizing the circuit depth of quantum multi-operand addition, which is a fundamental component in quantum implementations (as an example, SHA-2). \r\nBuilding on the foundational quantum carry-save approach by Phil Gossett, we introduce a tree-based quantum carry-save adder. \r\nOur design integrates the Wallace and Dadda trees to optimize carry handling during multi-operand additions. \r\nTo further reduce circuit depth, we utilize additional ancilla qubits for parallel operations and introduce an efficient technique for reusing these ancilla qubits.\r\n\r\nOur tree-based carry-save adder achieves the lowest circuit depth ($T$-depth) and provides an improvement of over 82% (up to 99%) in the qubit count\u2013circuit depth product for multi-operand addition. \r\nFurthermore, we apply our method to multiplication, achieving the lowest circuit depth and an improvement of up to 87% in the qubit count\u2013circuit depth product.",

    "abstract": "Group signatures allow a user to sign anonymously on behalf of a group of users while allowing a tracing authority to trace the signer's identity in case of misuse. In Chaum and van Heyst's original model (EUROCRYPT'91), the group needs to stay fixed. Throughout various attempts, including partially dynamic group signatures and revocations, Bootle et al. (ACNS'16, J. Cryptol.) formalized the notion of fully dynamic group signatures (FDGS), enabling both enrolling and revoking users of the group. However, in their scheme, the verification process needs to take into account the latest system information, and a previously generated signature will be invalidated as soon as, for example, there is a change in the group. We therefore raise a research question: Is it possible to construct an FDGS under which the validity of a signature can survive future changes in the system information?\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose Everlasting Fully Dynamic Group Signatures (EFDGS) that allow signers to generate signatures that do not require verification with any specific epoch. Specifically, once the signatures are created, they are valid forever. It also guarantees that the signer can only output such a signature when she is a valid user of the system. We realize the above new model by constructing a plausibly post-quantum standard-lattice-based EFDGS.",

    "abstract": "FALCON is a post-quantum signature selected by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Although its side-channel resilience has been studied and a masking countermeasure proposed, the division is a major performance bottleneck. This work proposes a different approach to the masked FALCON division. We use the Newton method and a convergent sequence to approximate this operation. The performance of the masked division is improved by a factor 6.7 for two shares and 6.98 for three shares. For the Gaussian sampler, the improvements are of a factor 1.45 for two shares and 1.43 for three shares. Formal security proofs using the MIMO-SNI criteria are also provided.",

    "abstract": "We introduce audience injection attacks, a novel class of vulnerabilities that impact widely used Web-based authentication and authorization protocols, including OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, FAPI, CIBA, the Device Authorization Grant, and various well-established extensions, such as Pushed Authorization Requests, Token Revocation, Token Introspection, and their numerous combinations.\r\nThese protocols underpin services for billions of users across diverse ecosystems worldwide, spanning low-risk applications like social logins to high-risk domains such as open banking, insurance, and healthcare.\r\n\r\nAudience injection attacks exploit a critical weakness in a core security mechanism of these protocols - the handling of so-called audiences in signature-based client authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows attackers to compromise fundamental security objectives whenever these mechanisms are utilized across two or more server endpoints. They enable the attacker to impersonate users and gain unauthorized access to their resources, even in high-security protocol families specifically designed for sensitive applications.\r\n\r\nWe responsibly disclosed these vulnerabilities to the relevant standardization bodies, which recognized their severity.\r\nIn collaboration with these organizations, we developed fixes and supported a coordinated response, leading to an ongoing effort to update a dozen of standards, numerous major implementations, and far-reaching ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The online realm has witnessed a surge in the buying and selling of data, prompting the emergence of dedicated data marketplaces. These platforms cater to servers (sellers), enabling them to set prices for access to their data, and clients (buyers), who can subsequently purchase these data, thereby streamlining and facilitating such transactions. However, the current data market is primarily confronted with the following issues. Firstly, they fail to protect client privacy, presupposing that clients submit their queries in plaintext. Secondly, these models are susceptible to being impacted by malicious client behavior, for example, enabling clients to potentially engage in arbitrage activities.\r\n\r\nTo address the aforementioned issues, we propose payable secure computation, a novel secure computation paradigm specifically designed for data pricing scenarios. It grants the server the ability to securely procure essential pricing information while protecting the privacy of client queries. Additionally, it fortifies the server's privacy against potential malicious client activities. As specific applications, we have devised customized payable protocols for two distinct secure computation scenarios: Keyword Private Information Retrieval (KPIR) and Private Set Intersection (PSI). \r\n\r\nWe implement our two payable protocols and compare them with the state-of-the-art related protocols that do not support pricing as a baseline. Since our payable protocols are more powerful in the data pricing setting, the experiment results show that they do not introduce much overhead over the baseline protocols. \r\nOur payable KPIR achieves the same online cost as baseline, while the setup is about $1.3-1.6\\times$ slower than it. Our payable PSI needs about $2\\times$ more communication cost than that of baseline protocol, while the runtime is $1.5-3.2\\times$ slower than it depending on the network setting.",

    "abstract": "The works of Garg et al. [S&P'24] (aka hinTS) and Das et al. [CCS'23] introduced the notion of silent threshold signatures (STS) - where a set of signers silently perform local computation to generate a public verification key. To sign a message, any set of $t$ signers sign the message non-interactively and these are aggregated into a constant-sized signature. This paradigm avoids performing expensive Distributed Key Generation procedure for each set of signers while keeping the public verification key constant-sized. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose the notion of committee-based silent threshold signature (c-STS) scheme. In a c-STS scheme, a set of signers initially perform a one-time setup to generate the verification key, and then a subset of signers are randomly chosen for an epoch to perform the threshold signing while the other signers are not authorized to sign during that epoch. This captures existing systems like Ethereum Altair and Dfinity where only a specific committee is authorized to sign in a designated epoch. The existing STS schemes cannot be extended to the committee setting because the signature verification only attests to the number of signing parties, not which committee they belong to.\r\n\r\nSo, we upgrade hinTS to the committee setting by proposing Dyna-hinTS. It is the $first$ c-STS scheme and it requires a one-time silent setup and generates a one-time public verification key that does not vary with the committee. Assuming a set of 1024 signers (with corrupt 682 signers), hinTS generates an aggregated signature in 1.7s whereas Dyna-hinTS generates it in $0.35$s within a committee of $80$ signers. This yields a $4.9\\times$ improvement over hinTS for signature generation at the cost of increasing signature verification time by $4\\%$ over hinTS. Dyna-hinTS supports general access structure, weighted signatures and improves existing multiverse threshold signatures.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present an improved framework for proving query bounds in the Quantum Random Oracle Model (QROM) for algorithms with both quantum and classical query interfaces, where the classical input is partially controlled by the adversary. By extending existing techniques, we develop a method to bound the progress an adversary can make with such partial-control classical queries. While this framework is applicable to different hash function properties, we decided to demonstrate the impact of the new techniques by giving an analysis of the multi-target extended target collision resistance property (m-eTCR). This new approach allows us to achieve an improved bound that significantly reduces the required function key size. Our proof is tight in terms of query complexity and has significant implications for cryptographic applications, especially for signature schemes in the hash & sign paradigm, enabling more efficient instantiations with reduced salt sizes and smaller signature lengths. For an example of multiple signatures aggregation, we achieve a signature size of 30 kB smaller.",

We also incorporate boolean logic gates of types XOR, NOT-Shift and Permutation which get applied to the light ray after each interaction with a reflecting or refracting polynomial curve. This alternating interaction between Optical gates (polynomial curves) and Non-optical gates creates a complex and secure cryptographic system.

    "abstract": "The YOSO (You Only Speak Once) model, introduced by Gentry et al. (CRYPTO 2021), helps to achieve strong security guarantees in cryptographic protocols for  distributed settings, like blockchains, with large number of parties. YOSO protocols typically employ smaller anonymous committees to execute individual rounds of the protocol instead of having all parties execute the entire protocol. After completing their tasks, parties encrypt protocol messages for the next anonymous committee and erase their internal state before publishing ciphertexts, thereby enhancing security in dynamically changing environments.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we consider the problem of secure multi-party computation (MPC), a fundamental problem in cryptography and distributed computing. We assume honest majority among the committee members, and work in the online-offline, i.e., preprocessing, setting.\r\n   In this context, we present the first YOSO MPC protocol where efficiency---measured as communication complexity---improves as the number of parties increases. Specifically, for $0<\\epsilon<1/2$ and an adversary corrupting $t<n(\\frac{1}{2}-\\epsilon)$ out of $n$ parties, our MPC protocol exhibits enhanced scalability as $n$ increases, where the online phase communication becomes independent of $n$.\r\n   Prior YOSO MPC protocols considered $t$ as large as $(n-1)/2$, but a significant hurdle persisted in obtaining YOSO MPC with communication that does not scale linearly with the number of committee members, a challenge that is exagerbated when the committee size was large per YOSO's requirements.\r\n   We show that, by considering a small ``gap'' of $\\epsilon>0$, the sizes of the committees are only marginally increased, while online communication is significantly reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we explicitly consider fail-stop adversaries, i.e., honest participants who may inadvertently fail due to reasons such as denial of service or software/hardware errors. In prior YOSO work, these adversaries were grouped with fully malicious parties. Adding explicit support for them allows us to achieve even better scalability.",

    "abstract": "SAND is an AND-RX-based lightweight block cipher proposed by Chen et al. There are two variants of SAND, namely SAND-64 and SAND-128, due to structural differences. In this paper, we search for impossible differential distinguishers of SAND-64 using the Constraint Programming (CP) and reveal 56 types of impossible differential distinguishers up to 11 rounds. Furthermore, we demonstrate a key recovery attack on 17-round SAND-64. The complexities for the attack require $2^{56}$ data, $2^{127}$ encryptions, and $2^{60}$ bytes of memory, respectively. Although this result currently achieves the best attack on round-reduced SAND-64, this attack does not threaten the security of SAND-64 against impossible differential attack.",
