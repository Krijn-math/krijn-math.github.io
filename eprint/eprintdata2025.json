        "abstract": "We provide the first attribute based encryption (ABE) scheme for Turing machines supporting unbounded collusions from lattice assumptions. In more detail, the encryptor encodes an attribute $\\mathbf{x}$ together with a bound $t$ on the machine running time and a message $m$ into the ciphertext, the key generator embeds a Turing machine $M$ into the secret key and decryption returns $m$ if and only if $M(\\mathbf{x})=1$. Crucially, the input $\\mathbf{x}$ and machine $M$ can be of unbounded size, the time bound $t$ can be chosen dynamically for each input and decryption runs in input specific time. \r\n    \r\nPreviously the best known ABE for uniform computation supported only non-deterministic log space Turing machines (${\\sf NL})$ from pairings (Lin and Luo, Eurocrypt 2020). In the post-quantum regime, the state of the art supports non-deterministic finite automata from LWE in the $\\textit{ symmetric}$ key setting (Agrawal, Maitra and Yamada, Crypto 2019). \r\n\r\nIn more detail, our results are:\r\n\r\n1. We construct the first ABE for ${\\sf NL}$ from the LWE, evasive LWE (Wee, Eurocrypt 2022 and Tsabary, Crypto 2022) and Tensor LWE (Wee, Eurocrypt 2022) assumptions. This yields the first (conjectured) post-quantum ABE for ${\\sf NL}$. \r\n 2. Relying on LWE, evasive LWE and a new assumption called $\\textit{circular tensor}$ LWE, we construct ABE for all Turing machines. At a high level, the circular tensor LWE assumption incorporates circularity into the tensor LWE (Wee, Eurocrypt 2022) assumption.\r\n\r\nTowards our ABE for Turing machines, we obtain the first CP-ABE for circuits of unbounded depth and size from the same assumptions -- this may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "We propose an e-voting protocol based on a novel linkable ring signature scheme with unconditional anonymity. In our system, all voters create private credentials and register their public counterparts. To vote, they create a ring (anonymity set) consisting of public credentials together with a proof of knowledge of their secret credential via our signature. Its unconditional anonymity prevents an attacker, no matter how powerful, from deducing the identity of the voter, thus attaining everlasting privacy. Additionally, our protocol provides coercion resistance in the JCJ framework; when an adversary tries to coerce a voter, the attack can be evaded by creating a signature with a fake but indistinguishable credential. During a moment of privacy, they will cast their real vote. Our scheme also provides verifiability and ballot secrecy.",

    "abstract": "In classical DNSSEC, a drop-in replacement with quantum-safe cryptography would increase DNS query resolution times by $\\textit{at least}$ a factor of $2\\times$. Since a DNS response containing large post-quantum signatures is likely to get marked truncated ($\\texttt{TC}$) by a nameserver (resulting in a wasted UDP round-trip), the client (here, the resolver) would have to retry its query over TCP, further incurring a $\\textit{minimum}$ of two round-trips due to the three-way TCP handshake.\r\n\r\nWe present $\\mathsf{TurboDNS}$: a backward-compatible protocol that eliminates $\\textit{two}$ round-trips from the preceding flow by 1) sending TCP handshake data in the initial DNS/UDP flight itself, and 2) immediately streaming the DNS response over TCP after authenticating the client with a cryptographic cookie. Our experiments show that DNSSEC over $\\mathsf{TurboDNS}$, with either Falcon-512 or Dilithium-2 as the zone signing algorithm, is practically as fast as the currently deployed ECDSA P-256 and RSA-2048 setups in resolving $\\texttt{QTYPE}$ $\\texttt{A}$ DNS queries.",

    "abstract": "Secure multi-party computation (MPC) is a crucial tool for privacy-preserving computation, but it is getting increasingly complicated due to recent advancements and optimizations. Programming tools for MPC allow programmers to develop MPC applications without mastering all cryptography. However, most existing MPC programming tools fail to attract real users due to the lack of documentation, maintenance, and the ability to compose with legacy codebases. In this work, we build Smaug, a modular extension of LLVM. Smaug seamlessly brings all LLVM support to MPC programmers, including error messaging, documentation, code optimization, and frontend support to compile from various languages to LLVM intermediate representation (IR). Smaug can efficiently convert non-oblivious LLVM IR to their oblivious counterparts while applying popular optimizations as LLVM code transformations. With benchmarks written in C++ and Rust and backends for Yao and GMW protocols, we observe that Smaug performs as well as (and sometimes much better than) prior tools using domain-specific languages with similar backends. Finally, we use Smaug to compile open-source projects that\r\nimplement Minesweeper and Blackjack, producing usable two-party games with ease.",

    "abstract": "Cryptocurrency practices worldwide are seen as innovative, yet they navigate a fragmented regulatory environment. Many local authorities aim to balance promoting innovation, safeguarding consumers, and managing potential threats. In particular, it is unclear how people deal with cryptocurrencies in the regions where trading or mining is prohibited. This insight is crucial in conveying the risk reduction strategies. To address this, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 28 cryptocurrency traders and miners from Bangladesh, where the local authority is hostile towards cryptocurrencies. Our research revealed that the participants use unique strategies to mitigate risks around cryptocurrencies. Our findings indicate a prevalent uncertainty at both personal and organizational levels concerning the interpretation of laws, a situation worsened by the actions of the major financial service providers who indirectly facilitate cryptocurrency transactions. We further connect our findings to the broader issues in HCI regarding folk models, informal market and legality, and education and awareness.",

    "abstract": "This survey provides a comprehensive examination of verifiable computing, tracing its evolution from foundational complexity theory to modern zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (ZK-SNARKs). We explore key developments in interactive proof systems, knowledge complexity, and the application of low-degree polynomials in error detection and verification protocols. The survey delves into essential mathematical frameworks such as the Cook-Levin Theorem, the sum-check protocol, and the GKR protocol, highlighting their roles in enhancing verification efficiency and soundness. By systematically addressing the limitations of traditional NP-based proof systems and then introducing advanced interactive proof mechanisms to overcome them, this work offers an accessible step-by-step introduction for newcomers while providing detailed mathematical analyses for researchers. Ultimately, we synthesize these concepts to elucidate the GKR protocol, which serves as a foundation for contemporary verifiable computing models. This survey not only reviews the historical and theoretical advancements in verifiable computing over the past three decades but also lays the groundwork for understanding recent innovations in the field.",

Beyond these applications, the paper makes two key contributions: the introduction of a novel cheater identification algorithm designed to verify the correct submission of shares during secret reconstruction, and empirical validation through experimental studies to support the theoretical advancements. This multifaceted approach not only demonstrates the versatility of SBIoT but also proposes innovative mechanisms to enhance security and integrity, contributing to the development of a more robust cryptographic framework.\r\nThis article expands upon the work presented in the poster \"A Combinatorial Approach to IoT Data Security\" at IWSEC 2023, Yokohama, Japan.",

    "abstract": "Side-channel analysis (SCA) does not aim at the algorithm's weaknesses but rather its implementations. The rise of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) is giving adversaries advanced capabilities to perform stealthy attacks. In this paper, we propose DL-SCADS, a DL-based approach along with signal decomposition techniques to leverage the power of secret key extraction from post-silicon EM/power side-channel traces. We integrate previously proven effective ideas of model ensembling and automated hyperparameter tuning with signal decomposition to develop an efficient and robust side-channel attack. Extensive experiments are performed on Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. The evaluation of the performance of the side-channel attack employing various decomposition techniques and comparison with the proposed approach in a range of datasets are also tabulated.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to calculating the Levenshtein (edit) distance within the framework of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), specifically targeting third-generation schemes like TFHE. Edit distance computations are essential in applications across finance and genomics, such as DNA sequence alignment. We introduce an optimised algorithm that significantly reduces the cost of edit distance calculations called Leuvenshtein. This algorithm specifically reduces the number of programmable bootstraps (PBS) needed per cell of the calculation, lowering it from approximately 28 operations\u2014required by the conventional Wagner-Fisher algorithm\u2014to just 1. Additionally, we propose an efficient method for performing equality checks on characters, reducing ASCII character comparisons to only 2 PBS operations. Finally, we explore the potential for further performance improvements by utilizing preprocessing when one of the input strings is unencrypted. Our Leuvenshtein achieves up to $205\\times$ faster performance compared to the best available TFHE implementation and up to $39\\times$ faster than an optimised implementation of the Wagner-Fisher algorithm. Moreover, when offline preprocessing is possible due to the presence of one unencrypted input on the server side, an additional $3\\times$ speedup can be achieved.",

By employing DWTs, the protocols significantly reduce the overhead typically associated with Lookup Table-style (LUT) evaluations in MPC. We state and prove foundational results for DWT-compressed LUTs in MPC, present protocols for 9 of the most common activation functions used in ML, and experimentally evaluate the performance of our protocols for large domain sizes in the LAN and WAN settings. Our protocols are extremely fast -- for instance, when considering 64-bit inputs, computing 1000 parallel instances of the sigmoid function, with an error less than $2^{-24}$ takes only a few hundred milliseconds incurs just 29\\,KiB of online communication (40 bytes per evaluation).",

    "abstract": "The Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU), a standard feature in all modern computing systems, presents significant security risks by leaking sensitive user activities through microarchitectural event data. This work demonstrates the feasibility of remote side-channel attacks leveraging PMU data, revealing vulnerabilities that compromise user privacy and enable covert surveillance without physical access to the target machine. By analyzing the PMU feature space, we create distinct micro-architectural fingerprints for benchmark applications, which are then utilized in machine learning (ML) models to detect the corresponding benchmarks. This approach allows us to build a pre-trained model for benchmark detection using the unique micro-architectural fingerprints derived from PMU data. Subsequently, when an attacker remotely accesses the victim\u2019s PMU data, the pre-trained model enables the identification of applications used by the victim with high accuracy. In our proof-of-concept demonstration, the pre-trained model successfully identifies applications used by a victim when the attacker remotely accesses PMU data, showcasing the potential for malicious exploitation of PMU data. We analyze stress-ng benchmarks and build our classifiers using logistic regression, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest ML models. Our proposed models achieve an average prediction accuracy of 98%, underscoring the potential risks associated with remote side-channel analysis using PMU data and emphasizing the need for more robust safeguards. This work underscores the urgent need for robust countermeasures to protect against such vulnerabilities and provides a foundation for future research in micro-architectural security.",

    "abstract": "Index Calculus (IC) algorithm is the most effective probabilistic algorithm for solving discrete logarithms over finite fields of prime numbers, and it has been widely applied to cryptosystems based on elliptic curves. Since the IC algorithm was proposed in 1920, the research on it has never stopped, especially discretization of prime numbers on the finite fields, both the algorithm itself and its application have been greatly developed. Of course, there has been some research on elliptic curves,but with little success. For the IC algorithm, scholars pay more attention to how to improve the probability of solving and reduce the time complexity of calculation. It is the first time for the IICA to study the optimization problem of the IC by using the method of integer. However, the IICA only studies the case of integer up, and fails to consider the case of integer down. It is found that the integer direction of the IICA can be integer up or integer down, but the concept of modular multiplication needs to be used when integer down. After optimizing the IICA, the probability of successful solution of discrete logarithm is increased by nearly 2 times, and the number of transformations is also reduced to a certain extent, thus reducing the time complexity of solution. The re-optimized the IC algorithm greatly improves the probability of successful the IC solution. This research result poses a serious challenge to cryptosystems based on finite fields of prime numbers.",

    "abstract": "Internet-scale consensus protocols used by blockchains are designed to remain operational in the presence of unexpected temporary crash faults (the so-called sleepy model of consensus) -- a critical feature for the latency-sensitive financial applications running on these systems. \r\nHowever, their leader-based architecture, where a single block proposer is responsible for creating the block at each height, makes them vulnerable to short-term censorship attacks, in which the proposers profit at the application layer by excluding certain transactions. \r\nIn this work, we introduce an atomic broadcast protocol, secure in the sleepy model, that ensures the inclusion of all transactions within a constant expected time, provided that at least one participating node is non-censoring at all times. \r\nUnlike traditional approaches, our protocol avoids designating a single proposer per block height, instead leveraging a so-called dynamically available common subset (DACS) protocol -- the first of its kind in the sleepy model. Additionally, our construction guarantees deterministic synchronization -- once an honest node confirms a block, all other honest nodes do so within a constant time, thus addressing a shortcoming of many low-latency sleepy protocols.",

    "abstract": "This paper improves upon the quantum circuits required for the Shor's attack on binary elliptic curves. We present two types of quantum point addition, taking both qubit count and circuit depth into consideration. \r\n\r\nIn summary, we propose an in-place point addition that improves upon the work of Banegas et al. from CHES'21, reducing the qubit count \u2013 depth product by more than $73\\%$ \u2013 $81\\%$ depending on the variant. Furthermore, we develop an out-of-place point addition by using additional qubits. This method achieves the lowest circuit depth and offers an improvement of over $92\\%$ in the qubit count \u2013 quantum depth product (for a single step).\r\n\r\nTo the best of our knowledge, our work improves from all previous works (including the CHES'21 paper by Banegas et al., the IEEE Access'22 paper by Putranto et al., and the CT-RSA'23 paper by Taguchi and Takayasu) in terms of circuit depth and qubit count \u2013 depth product. \r\n\r\nEquipped with the implementations, we discuss the post-quantum security of the binary elliptic curve cryptography. Under the MAXDEPTH metric (proposed by the US government's NIST), the quantum circuit with the highest depth in our work is $2^{24}$, which is significantly lower than the MAXDEPTH limit of $2^{40}$. For the gate count \u2013 full depth product, a metric for estimating quantum attack cost (proposed by NIST), the highest complexity in our work is $2^{60}$ for the curve having degree 571 (which is comparable to AES-256 in terms of classical security), considerably below the post-quantum security level 1 threshold (of the order of $2^{156}$).",

    "abstract": "Cryptography based on the presumed hardness of decoding codes -- i.e., code-based cryptography -- has recently seen increased interest due to its plausible security against quantum attackers. Notably, of the four proposals for the NIST post-quantum standardization process that were advanced to their fourth round for further review, two were code-based. The most efficient proposals -- including HQC and BIKE, the NIST submissions alluded to above -- in fact rely on the presumed hardness of decoding structured codes. Of particular relevance to our work, HQC is based on quasi-cyclic codes, which are codes generated by matrices consisting of two cyclic blocks.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the security analysis of HQC requires a precise understanding of the Decryption Failure Rate (DFR), whose analysis relies on the following heuristic: given random \"sparse\" vectors $e_1,e_2$ (say, each coordinate is i.i.d. Bernoulli) multiplied by fixed \"sparse\" quasi-cyclic matrices $A_1,A_2$, the weight of resulting vector $e_1A_1+e_2A_2$ is very concentrated around its expectation. In the documentation, the authors model the distribution of $e_1A_1+e_2A_2$ as a vector with independent coordinates (and correct marginal distribution). However, we uncover cases where this modeling fails. While this does not invalidate the (empirically verified) heuristic that the weight of $e_1A_1+e_2A_2$ is concentrated, it does suggest that the behavior of the noise is a bit more subtle than previously predicted. Lastly, we also discuss implications of our result for potential worst-case to average-case reductions for quasi-cyclic codes.",

    "abstract": "Today, many auctions are carried out with the help of intermediary platforms like Google and eBay. These platforms serve as a  rendezvous point for the buyers and sellers, and charge a fee for its service. We refer to such auctions as platform-assisted auctions. Traditionally, the auction theory literature mainly focuses on designing auctions that incentivize the buyers to bid truthfully, assuming that the platform always faithfully implements the auction. In practice, however, the platforms have been found to   manipulate the auctions to earn more profit, resulting in high-profile anti-trust lawsuits. \r\n\r\nWe propose a new model  for studying platform-assisted  auctions in the permissionless setting, where anyone can register and participate in the auction. We explore whether it is possible to design a dream auction in this new model, such that honest behavior  is the utility-maximizing strategy for each individual buyer, the platform, the seller, as well as platform-seller or platform-buyer coalitions. Through a collection of feasibility and infeasibility results, we carefully characterize the mathematical landscape of platform-assisted auctions. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, our work reveals exciting connections between cryptography and mechanism design. We show how cryptography can lend to the design of an efficient platform-assisted auction with dream properties. Although a line of works have also used multi-party computation (MPC) or the blockchain to remove the reliance on a trusted auctioneer, our work is distinct in nature in several dimensions. First, we initiate a systematic exploration of  the game theoretic implications when the service providers (e.g., nodes that implement the MPC or blockchain protocol) are strategic and can collude with sellers or buyers.  Second,  we observe that the full simulation paradigm used in the standard MPC literature is too stringent and leads to high asymptotical costs. Specifically,  because every player has a different private outcome in an auction protocol, to the best of our knowledge, running any generic MPC  protocol among the players would incur at least $n^2$ total cost  where $n$ is the number of buyers.We propose a new notion of simulation called {\\it utility-dominated emulation} that is sufficient for guaranteeing the game-theoretic properties needed in an auction. Under this new notion of simulation, we show how to design efficient auction protocols with quasilinear efficiency, which gives an $n$-fold improvement over any generic approach.",

    "abstract": "Electromagnetic side-channel analysis is a powerful method for monitoring processor activity and compromising cryptographic systems in air-gapped environments. As analytical methodologies and target devices evolve, the importance of leakage localization and probe aiming becomes increasingly apparent for capturing only the desired signals with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Despite its importance, there remains substantial reliance on unreliable heuristic approaches and inefficient exhaustive searches. Furthermore, related studies often fall short in terms of feasibility, practicality, and performance, and are limited to controlled DUTs and low-end MCUs.\r\n\r\nTo address the limitations and inefficiencies of the previous approaches, we propose a novel methodology\u2015${\\rm P{\\tiny ROBE}S{\\tiny HOOTER}}$\u2015for leakage localization and probe aiming. This approach leverages new insights into the spatial characteristics of amplitude modulation and intermodulation distortion in processors. As a result, ${\\rm P{\\tiny ROBE}S{\\tiny HOOTER}}$ provides substantial improvements in various aspects: $\\boldsymbol 1)$ it is applicable to not only simple MCUs but also complex SoCs, $\\boldsymbol 2)$ it effectively handles multi-core systems and dynamic frequency scaling, $\\boldsymbol 3)$ it is adoptable to uncontrollable DUTs, making it viable for constrained real-world attacks, and $\\boldsymbol 4)$ it performs significantly faster than previous methods. To demonstrate this, we experimentally evaluate ${\\rm P{\\tiny ROBE}S{\\tiny HOOTER}}$ on a high-end MCU (the NXP i.MX RT1061 featuring a single ARM Cortex-M7 core) and a complex SoC (the Broadcom BCM2711 equipped with the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, featuring four ARM Cortex-A72 cores).",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce an oracle version of the Restricted Syndrome Decoding Problem (RSDP) and propose novel authentication protocols based on the hardness of this problem. They follow the basic structure of the HB-family of authentication protocols and later improvements but demonstrate several advantages.\r\nAn appropriate choice of multiplicative subgroup and ring structure gives rise to a very efficient hardware implementation compared to other \\emph{Learning Parity with Noise} based approaches. In addition, the new protocols also have lower key size, lower communication costs, and potentially better completeness/soundness compared to learning-based alternatives. This is appealing in the context of low-cost, low-powered authenticating devices such as radio frequency identification (RFID) systems. \r\nLastly, we show that with additional assumptions, RSDP can be used to instantiate a Man-in-the-Middle secured authentication protocol.",

    "abstract": "Multi-input and large-precision lookup table (LUT) evaluation pose significant challenges in Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). Currently, two modes are employed to address this issue. One is tree-based functional bootstrapping (TFBS), which uses multiple blind rotations to construct a tree for LUT evaluation. The second is circuit bootstrapping, which decomposes all inputs into bits and utilizes a CMux tree for LUT evaluation. In this work, we propose a novel mode that is leveled functional bootstrapping. This mode utilizes the external product tree to perform multi-input functional bootstrapping. We implement TFBS and LFBS within the OpenFHE library. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms TFBS in both computational efficiency and bootstrapping key size. Specifically, for 12-bit and 16-bit input LUTs, our method is approximately two to three orders of magnitude faster than TFBS.\r\nFinally, we introduce a novel scheme-switching framework that supports large-precision polynomial and non-polynomial evaluations. The framework leverages digital extraction techniques to enable seamless switching between the BFV and LFBS schemes.",

Yet, historically such network designs have not been made public, leading to limited formal cryptographic analysis of the security offered by them. One of the few public protocols used in space networking is the Bundle Protocol, which is secured by Bundle Protocol Security (BPSec), an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard. We undertake a first analysis of BPSec under its default security context, building a model of the secure channel security goals stated in the IETF standard, and note issues therein with message loss detection. We prove BPSec secure, and also provide a stronger construction, one that supports the Bundle Protocol's functionality goals while also ensuring destination awareness of missing message components.",

    "abstract": "Secret handshakes, introduced by Balfanz et al. [3], allow users associated with various groups to determine if they share a common affiliation. These protocols ensure crucial properties such as fairness (all participants learn the result simultaneously), affiliation privacy (failed handshakes reveal no affiliation information), and result-hiding (even participants within a shared group cannot infer outcomes of unrelated handshakes). Over time, various secret-handshake schemes have been proposed, with a notable advancement being the modular framework by Tsudik and Xu. Their approach integrates three key components: group signature schemes, centralized secure channels for each group, and decentralized group key-agreement protocols.\r\nBuilding upon this modularity, we propose significant updates. By addressing hidden complexities and revising the security model, we enhance both the efficiency and the privacy guarantees of the protocol. Specifically, we achieve the novel property of Self distinction\u2014the ability to distinguish between two users in a session without revealing their identities\u2014by replacing the group signature primitive with a new construct, the List MAC. This primitive is inherently untraceable, necessitating adjustments to the original syntax to support stronger privacy guarantees. Consequently, we introduce the Traitor Catching paradigm, where the transcript of a handshake reveals only the identity of a traitor, preserving the anonymity of all other participants.\r\nTo showcase the flexibility and robustness of our updated framework, we present two post-quantum instantiations (a hash-based one and another based on lattices). Our approach not only corrects prior limitations but also establishes a new benchmark for privacy and security in secret handshakes.",

    "abstract": "Functional Encryption is a powerful cryptographic primitive that allows for fine-grained access control over encrypted data. In the multi-user setting, especially Multi-Client and Multi-Input, a plethora of works have been proposed to study on concrete function classes, improving security, and more. However, the CCA-security for such schemes is still an open problem, where the only known works are on Public-Key Single-Client FE ($\\mathit{e.g.}$ Benhamouda, Bourse, and Lipmaa, PKC'17).\r\n  This work provides the first generic construction of CCA-secure Multi-Client FE for Inner Products, and Multi-Input FE for Inner Products, with instantiations from $\\mathsf{SXDH}$ and $\\mathsf{DLIN}$ for the former, and $\\mathsf{DDH}$ or $\\mathsf{DCR}$ for the latter. Surprisingly, in the case of secret key MIFE we attain the same efficiency as in the public key single-client setting. In the MCFE setting, a toolkit of CCA-bootstrapping techniques is developed to achieve CCA-security in its $\\mathit{secret~key}$ setting.",

Motivated by its application in the SQIsign post-quantum signature scheme, we provide for the first time a constant time LLL-like algorithm with guarantees on the length of the shortest output vector.

    "abstract": "Two most common ways to design non-interactive zero knowledge (NIZK) proofs are based on Sigma ($\\Sigma$)-protocols (an efficient way to prove algebraic statements) and zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARK) protocols (an efficient way to prove arithmetic statements). However, in the applications of cryptocurrencies such as privacy-preserving credentials, privacy-preserving audits, and  blockchain-based voting systems, the zk-SNARKs for general statements are usually implemented with encryption, commitment, or other algebraic cryptographic schemes. Moreover, zk-SNARKs for many different arithmetic statements may also be required to be implemented together. Clearly, a typical solution is to extend the zk-SNARK circuit to include the code for algebraic part. However, complex cryptographic operations in the algebraic algorithms will significantly increase the circuit size, which leads to impractically large proving time and CRS size. Thus, we need a flexible enough proof system for composite statements including both algebraic and arithmetic statements. Unfortunately, while the conjunction of zk-SNARKs is relatively natural and numerous effective solutions are currently available (e.g. by utilizing the commit-and-prove technique), the disjunction of zk-SNARKs is rarely discussed in detail.\r\n        In this paper, we mainly focus on the disjunctive statements of Groth16, and we propose a Groth16 variant---CompGroth16, which provides a framework for Groth16 to prove the disjunctive statements that consist of a mix of algebraic and arithmetic components. Specifically, we could directly combine CompGroth16 with $\\Sigma$-protocol or even CompGroth16 with CompGroth16 just like the logical composition of $\\Sigma$-protocols. From this, we can gain many good properties, such as broader expression, better prover's efficiency and shorter CRS. In addition, for the combination of CompGroth16 and $\\Sigma$-protocol, we also present two representative application scenarios to demonstrate the practicality of our construction.",

    "abstract": "In recent development of secure multi-party computation (MPC), pseudorandom correlations of subfield vector oblivious linear evaluation (sVOLE) type become popular due to their amazing applicability in multi-dimensional MPC protocols such as privacy-preserving biometric identification and privacy-preserving machine learning protocols. In this paper, we introduce a novel way of VOLE distribution in three-party and four-party honest majority settings with the aid of a trusted server. This new method significantly decreases the communication cost and the memory storage of random sVOLE instances. On the other hand, it also enables a streamline distribution process that can generate a sVOLE instance of an arbitrary length, which results in 100 percent of utility rate of random sVOLE in multi-dimensional MPC protocols while preserving complete precomputability.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we address the problem of Delegated PSI (D-PSI), where a cloud server is introduced to handle most computational and communication tasks. D-PSI enables users to securely delegate their private sets to the cloud, ensuring the privacy of their data while allowing efficient computation of the intersection. The cloud operates under strict security requirements, learning nothing about the individual sets or the intersection result. Moreover, D-PSI minimizes user-to-user communication and supports \"silent\" processing, where the cloud can perform computations independently without user interaction, apart from set delegation and result retrieval.\r\n\r\nWe formally define the D-PSI problem and propose a novel construction that extends beyond two-party scenarios to support multi-party settings. Our construction adheres to the D-PSI requirements, including security against semi-honest adversaries, and achieves computational and communication complexities close to the ideal \"perfect\" D-PSI protocol. Additionally, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach through a baseline implementation and an optimized version that further reduces computational overhead. Our results establish a strong foundation for secure and efficient PSI in real-world cloud computing scenarios.",

    "abstract": "A central question in the theory of cryptography is whether we can build protocols that achieve stronger security guarantees, e.g., security against malicious adversaries,  by combining building blocks that achieve much weaker security guarantees, e.g., security only against semi-honest adversaries; and with the minimal number of rounds. An additional focus is whether these building blocks can be used only as a black-box. Since Oblivious Transfer (OT) is the necessary and sufficient building block to securely realize any two-party (and multi-party) functionality, theoreticians often focus on proving whether maliciously secure OT can be built from a weaker notion of OT.\r\n\r\nThere is a rich body of literature that provides (black-box) compilers that build malicious OT from OTs that achieve weaker security such as semi-malicious OT and defensibly secure OT,  within the minimal number of rounds. However, no round-optimal compiler exists that builds malicious OT from the weakest notion of semi-honest OT, in the plain model.\r\n\r\nCorrelation intractable hash (CIH) functions are special hash functions whose properties allow instantiating the celebrated Fiat-Shamir transform, and hence reduce the round complexity of public-coin proof systems. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we devise the first round-optimal compiler from semi-honest OT to malicious OT, by a novel application of CIH for collapsing rounds in the plain model. We provide the following contributions. First, we provide a new  CIH-based round-collapsing construction for general cut-and-choose. This gadget can be used generally to prove the correctness of the evaluation of a function. Then, we use our gadget to build the first round-optimal compiler from semi-honest OT to malicious OT.\r\n\r\nOur compiler uses the semi-honest OT protocol and the other building blocks in a black-box manner. However,  for technical reasons,  the underlying CIH construction requires the upper bound of the circuit size of the semi-honest OT protocol used. The need for this upper-bound makes our protocol not fully black-box, hence is incomparable with existing, fully black-box, compilers.",

    "abstract": "The server-aided model for multiparty computation (MPC) was introduced to capture a real-world scenario where clients wish to off-load the heavy computation of MPC protocols to dedicated servers. A rich body of work has studied various trade-offs between security guarantees (e.g., semi-honest vs malicious),  trust assumptions (e.g., the threshold on corrupted servers), and efficiency. \r\n\r\nHowever, all existing works make the assumption that all clients must agree on employing the same servers, and accept the same corruption threshold. In this paper, we challenge this assumption and introduce a new paradigm for server-aided MPC, where each client can choose their own set of servers and their own threshold of corrupted servers. In this new model, the privacy of each client is guaranteed as long as their own threshold is satisfied, regardless of the other servers/clients. We call this paradigm per-party private server-aided MPC to highlight both a security and efficiency guarantee: (1) per-party privacy, which means that each party gets their own privacy guarantees that depend on their own choice of the servers; (2) per-party complexity, which means that each party only needs to communicate with their chosen servers. Our primary contribution is a new theoretical framework for server-aided MPC. We provide two protocols to show feasibility, but leave it as a future work to investigate protocols that focus on concrete efficiency.",

We give an explicit parametrization of the maximal orders in $B_{p,\\infty}$ appearing as endomorphism rings of the elliptic curves in this graph that are $\\leq e$ steps away from a root vertex with $j$-invariant 1728. This is the first explicit parametrization of this kind and we believe it will be an aid in better understanding the structure of supersingular $\\ell$-isogeny graphs that are widely used in cryptography. Our method makes use of the inherent directions in the supersingular isogeny graph induced via Bruhat-Tits trees, as studied in [1]. We also discuss how in future work other interesting use cases, such as $\\ell=2$, could benefit from the same methodology.",

    "abstract": "We introduce ZODA, short for 'zero-overhead data availability,' which is a protocol for proving that symbols received from an encoding (for tensor codes) were correctly constructed. ZODA has optimal overhead for both the encoder and the samplers. Concretely, the ZODA scheme incurs essentially no incremental costs (in either computation or size) beyond those of the tensor encoding itself. In particular, we show that a slight modification to the encoding scheme for tensor codes allows sampled rows and columns of this modified encoding to become proofs of their own correctness. When used as part of a data availability sampling protocol, both encoders (who encode some data using a tensor code with some slight modifications) and samplers (who sample symbols from the purported encoding and verify that these samples are correctly encoded) incur no incremental communication costs and only small additional computational costs over having done the original tensor encoding. ZODA additionally requires no trusted setup and is plausibly post-quantum secure.",

    "abstract": "Unprotected cryptographic implementations are vulnerable to implementation attacks, such as passive side-channel attacks and active fault injection attacks. Recently, countermeasures like polynomial masking and duplicated masking have been introduced to protect implementations against combined attacks that exploit leakage and faults simultaneously.\r\nWhile duplicated masking requires $O(t * e)$ shares to resist an adversary capable of probing $t$ values and faulting $e$ values, polynomial masking requires only $O(t + e)$ shares, which is particularly beneficial for affine computation. \r\nAt CHES'$24$, Arnold et al. showed how to further improve the efficiency of polynomial masking in the presence of combined attacks by embedding two secrets into one polynomial sharing. This essentially reduces the complexity of previous constructions by half. The authors also observed that using techniques from packed secret sharing (Grosso et al., CHES'$13$) cannot easily achieve combined resilience to encode an arbitrary number of secrets in one polynomial encoding.\r\nIn this work, we resolve these challenges and show that it is possible to embed an arbitrary number of secrets in one encoding and propose gadgets that are secure against combined attacks. We present two constructions that are generic and significantly improve the computational and randomness complexity of existing compilers, such as the laOla compiler presented by Berndt et al. at CRYPTO'$23$ and its improvement by Arnold et al. \r\nFor example, for an AES evaluation that protects against $t$ probes and $e$ faults, we improve the randomness complexity of the state-of-the-art construction when $t+e>3$, leading to an improvement of up to a factor of $2.41$.",

    "abstract": "It is imperative to modernize traditional core cryptographic primitives, such as Oblivious Transfer (OT), to address the demands of the new digital era, where privacy-preserving computations are executed on low-power devices. This modernization is not merely an enhancement but a necessity to ensure security, efficiency, and continued relevance in an ever-evolving technological landscape. \r\n\r\nThis work introduces two scalable OT schemes: (1) Helix OT, a $1$-out-of-$n$ OT, and (2) Priority OT, a $t$-out-of-$n$ OT. Both schemes provide unconditional security, ensuring resilience against quantum adversaries. Helix OT achieves a receiver-side download complexity of $O(1)$. In big data scenarios, where certain data may be more urgent or valuable, we propose Priority OT. With a receiver-side download complexity of $O(t)$, this scheme allows data to be received based on specified priorities. By prioritizing data transmission, Priority OT ensures that the most important data is received first, optimizing bandwidth, storage, and processing resources.  Performance evaluations indicate that Helix OT completes the transfer of 1 out of $n=$ 16,777,216 messages in 9 seconds, and Priority OT handles $t=$ 1,048,576 out of $n$ selections in 30 seconds. Both outperform existing $t$-out-of-$n$ OTs (when $t\\geq 1$), underscoring their suitability for large-scale applications. To the best of our knowledge, Helix OT and Priority OT introduce unique advancements that distinguish them from previous schemes.",

    "abstract": "Proof-of-stake consensus protocols often rely on distributed randomness beacons (DRBs) to generate randomness for leader selection. This work analyses the manipulability of Ethereum's DRB implementation, RANDAO, in its current consensus mechanism. Even with its efficiency, RANDAO remains vulnerable to manipulation through the deliberate omission of blocks from the canonical chain. Previous research has shown that economically rational players can withhold blocks --~known as a block withholding attack or selfish mixing~-- when the manipulated RANDAO outcome yields greater financial rewards.\r\n\r\nWe introduce and evaluate a new manipulation strategy, the RANDAO forking attack. Unlike block withholding, whereby validators opt to hide a block, this strategy relies on selectively forking out an honest proposer's block to maximize transaction fee revenues and block rewards. \r\nIn this paper, we draw attention to the fact that the forking attack is significantly more harmful than selfish mixing for two reasons. Firstly, it exacerbates the unfairness among validators. More importantly, it significantly undermines the reliability of the blockchain for the average user by frequently causing already published blocks to be forked out. By doing so, the attacker can fork the chain without losing slots, and we demonstrate that these are later fully compensated for. Our empirical measurements, investigating such manipulations on Ethereum mainnet, revealed no statistically significant traces of these attacks to date.",

    "abstract": "Stateless blockchain designs have emerged to address the challenge of growing blockchain size using succinct global states. Previous works have developed vector commitments that support proof updates and aggregation to be used as such states. However, maintaining proofs for multiple users still demands significant computational resources, particularly to update proofs with every transaction.  This paper introduces Cauchyproofs, a batch-updatable vector commitment that enables proof-serving nodes to efficiently update proofs in quasi-linear time relative to the number of users and transactions, utilizing an optimized KZG scheme to achieve complexity $O\\left(\\left(\\left|\\vec{\\alpha}\\right| + \\left|\\vec{\\beta}\\right|\\right) \\log^2 (\\left|\\vec{\\alpha}\\right| + \\left|\\vec{\\beta}\\right|)\\right)$ for $\\left|\\alpha\\right|$ users and $\\left|\\beta\\right|$ transactions, compared to the previous $O\\left(\\left|\\vec{\\alpha}\\right|\\cdot|\\vec{\\beta}|\\right)$ approaches. This advancement reduces the computational burden on proof-serving nodes, allowing efficient proof maintenance across large user groups. We demonstrate that our approach is approximately five times faster than the naive approach at the Ethereum-level block size. Additionally, we present a novel matrix representation for KZG proofs utilizing Cauchy matrices, enabling faster all-proof computations with reduced elliptic curve operations. Finally, we propose an algorithm for history proof query, supporting retrospective proof generation with high efficiency. Our contributions substantially enhance the scalability and practicality of proof-serving nodes in stateless blockchain frameworks.",

    "abstract": "Verifiable random access machines (vRAMs) serve as a foundational model for expressing complex computations with provable security guarantees, serving applications in areas such as secure electronic voting, financial auditing, and privacy-preserving smart contracts. However, no existing vRAM provides distributed obliviousness, a critical need in scenarios where multiple provers seek to prevent disclosure against both other provers and the verifiers.\r\nImplementing a publicly verifiable distributed oblivious RAM (VDORAM) presents several challenges. Firstly, the development of VDORAM is hindered by the limited availability of sophisticated publicly verifiable multi-party computation (MPC) protocols. Secondly, the lack of readily available front-end implementations for multi-prover zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) poses a significant obstacle to developing practical applications. Finally, directly adapting existing RAM designs to the VDORAM paradigm may prove either impractical or inefficient due to the inherent complexities of reconciling oblivious computation with the generation of publicly verifiable proofs.\r\n\r\nTo address these challenges, we introduce CompatCircuit, the first multi-prover ZKP front-end implementation to our knowledge. CompatCircuit integrates collaborative zkSNARKs to implement publicly verifiable MPC protocols with rich functionalities beyond those of an arithmetic circuit, enabling the development of multi-prover ZKP applications. Building upon CompatCircuit, we present VDORAM, the first publicly verifiable distributed oblivious RAM. By combining distributed oblivious architectures with verifiable RAM, VDORAM achieves an efficient RAM design that balances communication overhead and proof generation time. We have implemented CompatCircuit and VDORAM in approximately 15,000 lines of code, demonstrating usability by providing a practical and efficient implementation. Our performance evaluation result reveals that the system still provides moderate performance with distributed obliviousness.",

    "abstract": "The Signal protocol relies on a special handshake protocol, formerly X3DH and now PQXDH, to set up secure conversations. Prior analyses of these protocols (or proposals for post-quantum alternatives) have all used highly tailored models to the individual protocols and generally made ad-hoc adaptations to \"standard\" AKE definitions, making the concrete security attained unclear and hard to compare between similar protocols. Indeed, we observe that some natural Signal handshake protocols cannot be handled by these tailored models. In this work, we introduce Bundled Authenticated Key Exchange (BAKE), a concrete treatment of the Signal handshake protocol. We formally model prekey bundles and states, enabling us to define various levels of security in a unified model. We analyze Signal's classically secure X3DH and harvest-now-decrypt-later-secure PQXDH, and show that they do not achieve what we call optimal security (as is documented). Next, we introduce RingXKEM, a fully post-quantum Signal handshake protocol achieving optimal security; as RingXKEM shares states among many prekey bundles, it could not have been captured by prior models. Lastly, we provide a security and efficiency comparison of X3DH, PQXDH, and RingXKEM.",

    "abstract": "An anonymous credential (AC) system with partial disclosure allows users to prove possession of a credential issued by an issuer while selectively disclosing a subset of their attributes to a verifier in a privacy-preserving manner. In keyed-verification AC (KVAC) systems, the issuer and verifier share a secret key. Existing KVAC schemes rely on computationally expensive zero-knowledge proofs during credential presentation, with the presentation size growing linearly with the number of attributes. In this work, we propose two highly efficient KVAC constructions that eliminate the need for zero-knowledge proofs during the credential presentation and achieve constant-size presentations.\r\n    Our first construction adapts the approach of Fuchsbauer et al. (JoC'19), which achieved constant-size credential presentation in a publicly verifiable setting using their proposed structure-preserving signatures on equivalence classes (SPS-EQ) and set commitment schemes, to the KVAC setting. We introduce structure-preserving message authentication codes on equivalence classes (SP-MAC-EQ) and designated-verifier set commitments (DVSC), resulting in a KVAC system with constant-size credentials (2 group elements) and presentations (4 group elements). To avoid the bilinear groups and pairing operations required by SP-MAC-EQ, our second construction uses a homomorphic MAC with a simplified DVSC. While this sacrifices constant-size credentials ($n+2$ group elements, where $n$ is the number of attributes), it retains constant-size presentations (2 group elements) in a pairingless setting. \r\n    We formally prove the security of both constructions and provide open-source implementation results demonstrating their practicality. We extensively benchmarked our KVAC protocols and, additionally, bechmarked the efficiency of our SP-MAC-EQ scheme against the original SPS-EQ scheme, showcasing significant performance improvements.",

Consider the rational quaternion algebra ramified at $p$ and $\\infty$ with a fixed maximal order $\\mathcal{O}_{1728}$. We give explicit formulae for bases of all cyclic norm $\\ell^n$ ideals of $\\mathcal{O}_{1728}$ and their right orders, in Hermite Normal Form (HNF). Further, in the case $\\ell \\mid p+1$, or more generally, $-p$ is a square modulo $\\ell$, we derive a parametrization of these bases along paths of the $\\ell$-ideal graph, generalising the results of [1]. With such orders appearing as the endomorphism rings of supersingular elliptic curves defined over $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_{p}}$, we note several potential applications to isogeny-based cryptography including fast ideal sampling algorithms. We also demonstrate how our findings may lead to further structural observations, by using them to prove a result on the successive minima of endomorphism rings of supersingular curves defined over $\\mathbb{F}_p$.\r\n\r\n[1] = https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/033",

    "abstract": "Selfish mining attacks present a serious threat to Bitcoin security, enabling a miner with less than 51% of the network hashrate to gain higher rewards than when mining honestly. A growing body of works has studied the impact of such attacks and presented numerous strategies under a variety of model settings. This led to a complex landscape with conclusions that are often exclusive to certain model assumptions. This growing complexity makes it hard to comprehend the state of the art and distill its impact and trade-offs.\r\n    \r\nIn this paper, we demystify the landscape of selfish mining by presenting a systematization framework of existing studies and evaluating their strategies under realistic model adaptations. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first of its kind. We develop a multi-dimensional systematization framework assessing prior works based on their strategy formulation and targeted models. We go on to distill a number of insights and gaps clarifying open questions and understudied areas. Among them, we find that most studies target the block-reward setting and do not account for transaction fees, and generally study the single attacker case. To bridge this gap, we evaluate many of the existing strategies in the no-block-reward setting---so miner's incentives come solely from transaction fees---for both the single and multi-attacker scenarios. We also extend their models to include a realistic honest-but-rational miners showing how such adaptations could garner more-performant strategy variations. Finally, we touch upon defenses proposed in the literature, and discuss connections between selfish mining and relevant incentivized/fee-driven paradigms.",

    "abstract": "Registered attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a generalization of public-key encryption that enables fine-grained access control to encrypted data (like standard ABE), but without needing a central trusted authority. In a key-policy registered ABE scheme, users choose their own public and private keys and then register their public keys together with a decryption policy with an (untrusted) key curator. The key curator aggregates all of the individual public keys into a short master public key which serves as the public key for an ABE scheme.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we can build registered ABE for restricted policies (e.g., Boolean formulas) from pairing-based assumptions and for general policies using witness encryption or indistinguishability obfuscation. In this work, we construct a key-policy registered ABE for general policies (specifically, bounded-depth Boolean circuits) from the $\\ell$-succinct learning with errors (LWE) assumption in the random oracle model. The ciphertext size in our registered ABE scheme is $\\mathsf{poly}(\\lambda, d)$, where $\\lambda$ is a security parameter and $d$ is the depth of the circuit that computes the policy circuit $C$. Notably, this is independent of the length of the attribute $\\mathbf{x}$ and is optimal up to the $\\mathsf{poly}(d)$ factor.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the only lattice-based instantiation of registered ABE uses witness encryption, which relies on private-coin evasive LWE, a stronger assumption than $\\ell$-succinct LWE. Moreover, the ciphertext size in previous registered ABE schemes that support general policies (i.e., from obfuscation or witness encryption) scales with $\\mathsf{poly}(\\lambda, |\\mathbf{x}|, |C|)$. The ciphertext size in our scheme depends only on the depth of the circuit (and not the length of the attribute or the size of the policy). This enables new applications to identity-based distributed broadcast encryption.\r\n\r\nOur techniques are also useful for constructing adaptively-secure (distributed) broadcast encryption, and we give the first scheme from the $\\ell$-succinct LWE assumption in the random oracle model. Previously, the only lattice-based broadcast encryption scheme with adaptive security relied on witness encryption in the random oracle model. All other lattice-based broadcast encryption schemes only achieved selective security.",

    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows a server to perform computations directly over the encrypted data. In general FHE protocols, the client is tasked with decrypting the computation result using its secret key. However, certain FHE applications benefit from the server knowing this result, especially without the aid of the client. Providing the server with the secret key allows it to decrypt all the data, including the client's private input. Protocols such as Goldwasser et. al. (STOC'13) have shown that it is possible to provide the server with the capability of conditional decryption that allows it to decrypt the result of some pre-defined computation and nothing else. While beneficial to an honest-but-curious server to aid in  providing better services, a malicious server may utilize this added advantage to perform active attacks on the overall FHE application to leak secret information. Existing security notions fail to capture this scenario since they assume that only the client has the ability to decrypt FHE ciphertexts. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new security notion named IND-CPA$^{\\text{C}}$, that provides the adversary with access to a conditional decryption oracle. We then show that none of the practical exact FHE schemes are secure under this notion by demonstrating a generic attack that utilizes this restricted decryption capability to recover the underlying errors in the FHE ciphertexts. Given the security guarantee of the underlying (R)LWE hardness problem collapses with the leakage of these error values, we show a full key recovery attack. Finally, we propose a technique to convert any IND-CPA secure FHE scheme into an IND-CPA$^\\text{C}$ secure FHE scheme. Our technique utilizes Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge, where the server is forced to generate a proof of an honest computation of the requested function along with the computation result. During decryption, the proof is verified, and the decryption proceeds only if the verification holds. Both the verification and decryption steps run inside a Garbled Circuit and thus are not observable or controllable by the server.",

    "abstract": "A secret-sharing scheme allows the distribution of a secret $s$ among $n$ parties, such that only certain predefined \u201cauthorized\u201d sets of parties can reconstruct the secret, while all other \u201cunauthorized\u201d sets learn nothing about $s$. The collection of authorized/unauthorized sets is defined by a monotone function $f: \\{0,1\\}^n \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$. It is known that any monotone function can be realized by a secret-sharing scheme; thus, the smallest achievable \\emph{total share size}, $S(f)$, serves as a natural complexity measure.\r\nIn this paper, we initiate the study of the following meta-complexity question: Given a monotone function $f$, is it possible to efficiently distinguish between cases where the secret-sharing complexity of $f$ is small versus large? We examine this question across several computational models, yielding the following main results.\r\n\r\n(Hardness for formulas and circuits): Given a monotone formula $f$ of size $L$, it is coNP-hard to distinguish between ``cheap'' functions, where the maximum share size is 1 bit and the total share size is $O(L^{0.01})$, and ``expensive'' functions, where the maximum share size is $\\Omega(\\sqrt{L})$ and the total share size is $\\Omega(L/\\log L)$.\r\nThis latter bound nearly matches known secret-sharing constructions yielding a total share size of $L$ bits. For monotone circuits, we strengthen the bound on the expensive case to a maximum share size of $\\Omega(L/\\log L)$ and a total share size of $\\Omega(L^2/\\log L)$. These results rule out the existence of instance-optimal compilers that map a formula $f$ to a secret-sharing scheme with complexity polynomially related to $S(f)$.\r\n\r\n(Hardness for truth tables): Under cryptographic assumptions, either (1) every $n$-bit slice function can be realized by a  $\\text{poly}(n)$-size secret-sharing scheme, or (2) given a truth-table representation of $f$ of size $N = 2^n$, it is computationally infeasible to distinguish in time $\\text{poly}(N)$ between cases where $S(f) = \\text{poly}(n)$ and $S(f) = n^{\\omega(1)}$. Option (1) would be considered a breakthrough result, as the best-known construction for slices has a sub-exponential complexity of $2^{\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})}$ (Liu, Vaikuntanathan, and Wee; Eurocrypt 2018). Our proof introduces a new worst-case-to-average-case reduction for slices, which may be of independent interest.\r\n\r\n(Hardness for graphs): We examine the simple case where $f$ is given as a 2-DNF, represented by a graph $G$ whose edges correspond to 2-terms, and ask whether it is possible to distinguish between cases where the share size is constant and those where the share size is large, say $\\Omega(\\log n)$. We establish several connections between this question and questions in communication complexity. For instance, we show that graphs admitting constant-cost secret sharing form a subclass of graphs with constant randomized communication complexity and constant-size adjacency sketches (Harms, Wild, and Zamaraev; STOC 2022). We leverage these connections to establish new lower bounds for specific graph families, derive a combinatorial characterization of graphs with constant-size linear secret-sharing schemes, and show that a natural class of myopic algorithms fails to distinguish cheap graphs from expensive ones.",

    "abstract": "Time-lock puzzles (TLP) are a cryptographic tool that allow one to encrypt a message into the future, for a predetermined amount of time $T$. At present, we have only two constructions with provable security: One based on the repeated squaring assumption and the other based on obfuscation. Basing TLP on any other assumption is a long-standing question, further motivated by the fact that known constructions are broken by quantum algorithms.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose a new approach to construct time-lock puzzles based on lattices, and therefore with plausible post-quantum security. We obtain the following main results:\r\n\r\n* In the preprocessing model, where a one-time public-coin preprocessing is allowed, we obtain a time-lock puzzle with encryption time $\\log(T)$.\r\n\r\n* In the plain model, where the encrypter does all the computation, we obtain a time-lock puzzle with encryption time $\\sqrt{T}$. \r\n\r\nBoth constructions assume the existence of any sequential function $f$, and the hardness of the circular small-secret learning with errors (LWE) problem. At the heart of our results is a new construction of succinct randomized encodings (SRE) for $T$-folded repeated circuits, where the complexity of the encoding is $\\sqrt{T}$. This is the first construction of SRE where the overall complexity of the encoding algorithm is sublinear in the runtime $T$, and which is not based on obfuscation. As a direct corollary, we obtain a non-interactive RAM delegation scheme with sublinear complexity (in the number of steps $T$).",

    "abstract": "Privacy and security have become critical priorities in many scenarios. Privacy-preserving computation (PPC) is a powerful solution that allows functions to be computed directly on encrypted data. Garbled circuit (GC) is a key PPC technology that enables secure, confidential computing. GC comes in two forms: Boolean GC supports all operations by expressing functions as logic circuits; arithmetic GC is a newer technique to efficiently compute a set of arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication. Mixed GC combines both Boolean and arithmetic GC, in an attempt to optimize performance by computing each function in its most natural form. However, this introduces additional costly conversions between the two forms. It remains unclear if and when the efficiency gains of arithmetic GC outweigh these conversion costs.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present A\u0332rithmetic \u1e06oolean \u1e3aogic E\u0332xchange for Garbled Circuit, the first real implementation of mixed GC. ABLE profiles the performance of Boolean and arithmetic GC operations along with their conversions. We assess not only communication but also computation latency, a crucial factor in evaluating the end-to-end runtime of GC. Based on these insights, we propose a method to determine whether it is more efficient to use general Boolean GC or mixed GC for a given application. Rather than implementing both approaches to identify the better solution for each unique case, our method enables users to select the most suitable GC realization early in the design process. This method evaluates whether the benefits of transitioning operations from Boolean to arithmetic GC offset the associated conversion costs. We apply this approach to a neural network task as a case study.\r\n\r\nImplementing ABLE reveals opportunities for further GC optimization. We propose a heuristic to reduce the number of primes in arithmetic GC, cutting communication by 14.1% and compute latency by 15.7% in a 16-bit system. Additionally, we optimize mixed GC conversions with row reduction technique, achieving a 48.6% reduction in garbled table size for bit-decomposition and a 50% reduction for bit-composition operation. These improvements reduce communication overhead in stream GC and free up storage in the GC with preprocessing approach. We open source our code for community use.",

    "abstract": "Cryptojacking, the unauthorised use of computing resources to mine cryptocurrency, has emerged as a critical threat in today\u2019s digital landscape. These attacks not only compromise system integrity but also result in increased costs, reduced hardware lifespan, and heightened network security risks. Early and accurate detection is essential to mitigate the adverse effects of cryptojacking. This study focuses on developing a semi-supervised machine learning (ML) approach that leverages an autoencoder for feature extraction and a random forest (RF) model for classification. The objective is to enhance cryptojacking detection while maintaining a balance between accuracy and interpretability. The proposed methodology is further enhanced with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques such as local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) to offer insights into model predictions. Results from datasets such as UGRansome and BitcoinHeist indicate that the semi-supervised approach achieves accuracy rates ranging from 70% to 99%. The study demonstrates that the proposed model provides an efficient, interpretable, and scalable solution for real-time cryptojacking detection across various scenarios.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the first black-box registered ABE for circuit from lattices. The selective security is based on evasive LWE assumption [EUROCRYPT'22, CRYPTO'22]. The unique prior Reg-ABE scheme from lattices is derived from non-black-box construction based on function-binding hash and witness encryption [CRYPTO'23]. Technically, we first extend the black-box registration-based encryption from standard LWE [CRYPTO'23] so that we can register a public key with a function; this yields a LWE-based Reg-ABE with ciphertexts of size $L \\cdot \\mathsf{polylog}(L)$ where $L$ is the number of users. We then make use of the special structure of its ciphertext to reduce its size to $\\mathsf{polylog}(L)$ via an algebraic obfuscator based on evasive LWE [CRYPTO'24].",

    "abstract": "Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) protocols that achieve Identifiable Abort (IA) guarantee honest parties that in the event that they are denied output, they will be notified of the identity of at least one corrupt party responsible for the abort. Cheater identification provides recourse in the event of a protocol failure, and in some cases can even be desired over Guaranteed Output Delivery. However, protocols in the literature typically make use of broadcast as a necessary tool in identifying cheaters. In many deployments, the broadcast channel itself may be the most expensive component.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we investigate if it is inherent that MPC with IA should bear the full complexity of broadcast. As the implication of broadcast from IA has been established in previous work, we relax our target to circumvent this connection: we allow honest parties to differ in which cheaters they identify, nonetheless retaining the ability to prove claims of cheating to an auditor.\r\n\r\nWe show that in the honest majority setting, our notion of Provable Identifiable Selective Abort (PISA) can be achieved without a traditional broadcast channel. Indeed, broadcast in this setting---which we term Broadcast with Selective Identifiable Abort (BC-IA)---is achievable in only two point-to-point rounds with a simple echoing technique. On the negative side, we also prove that BC-IA is impossible to achieve in the dishonest majority setting.\r\n\r\nAs a general result, we show that any MPC protocol that achieves IA with $r$ broadcasts, can be compiled to one that achieves PISA with $2(r+1)$ point to point rounds. As a practical application of this methodology, we design, implement, and benchmark a six-round honest majority threshold ECDSA protocol that achieves PISA, and can be deployed in any environment with point to point communication alone.",

    "abstract": "Zero-knowledge proofs of training (zkPoT) allow a party to prove that a model is trained correctly on a committed dataset without revealing any additional information about the model or the dataset. Existing zkPoT protocols prove the entire training process in zero knowledge; i.e., they prove that the final model was obtained in an iterative fashion starting from the training data and a random seed (and potentially other parameters) and applying the correct algorithm at each iteration. This approach inherently requires the prover to perform work linear to the number of iterations. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we take a different approach to proving the correctness of model training. Our approach is motivated by efficiency but also more urgently by the observation that the prover's ability to pick the random seed used for training introduces the potential for it to bias the model. In other words, if the input to the training algorithm is biased, the resulting model will be biased even if the prover correctly ran the training algorithm. Rather than prove the correctness of the training process, we thus directly prove the correctness of the training model using a notion we call optimum vicinity, which bounds the distance between the trained model and the mathematically optimal model for models that can be viewed as the solution to a convex optimization problem. We show both theoretically and experimentally that this ensures the trained model behaves similarly to the optimal model, and show this is not true for existing approaches. We also demonstrate significant performance improvements as compared to the existing zkPoT paradigm: the statement proven in ZK in our protocol has a size independent of the number of training iterations, and our Boolean (respectively arithmetic) circuit size is up to $246\\times$ (respectively $5\\times$) smaller than that of a baseline zkPoT protocol that verifies the whole training process.",

    "abstract": "Fuzzy private set intersection (Fuzzy PSI) is a cryptographic protocol for privacy-preserving similarity matching, which is one of the essential operations in various real-world applications such as facial authentication, information retrieval, or recommendation systems. Despite recent advancements in fuzzy PSI protocols, still a huge barrier remains in deploying them for these applications. The main obstacle is the high dimensionality, e.g., from 128 to 512, of data; lots of existing methods, Garimella et al. (CRYPTO\u201923, CRYPTO\u201924) or van Baarsen et al. (EUROCRYPT\u201924), suffer from exponential overhead on communication and/or computation cost. In addition, the dominant similarity metric in these applications is cosine similarity, which disables several optimization tricks based on assumptions for the distribution of data, e.g., techniques by Gao et al. (ASIACRYPT\u201924). In this paper, we propose a novel fuzzy PSI protocol for cosine similarity, called FPHE, that overcomes these limitations at the same time. FPHE features linear complexity on both computation and communication with respect to the dimension of set elements, only requiring much weaker assumption than prior works. The basic strategy of ours is to homomorphically compute cosine similarity and run an approximated comparison function, with a clever packing method for efficiency. In addition, we introduce a novel proof technique to harmonize the approximation error from the sign function with the noise flooding, proving the security of FPHE under the semi-honest model. Moreover, we show that our construction can be extended to support various functionalities, such as labeled or circuit fuzzy PSI. Through experiments, we show that FPHE can perform fuzzy PSI over 512-dimensional data in a few minutes, which was computationally infeasible for all previous proposals under the same assumption as ours.",

    "abstract": "With the threat posed by quantum computers on the horizon, systems like Ethereum must transition to cryptographic primitives resistant to quantum attacks. One of the most critical of these primitives is the non-interactive multi-signature scheme used in Ethereum's proof-of-stake consensus, currently implemented with BLS signatures. This primitive enables validators to independently sign blocks, with their signatures then publicly aggregated into a compact aggregate signature.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we introduce a family of hash-based signature schemes as post-quantum alternatives to BLS. We consider the folklore method of aggregating signatures via (hash-based) succinct arguments, and our work is focused on instantiating the underlying signature scheme. The proposed schemes are variants of the XMSS signature scheme, analyzed within a novel and unified framework. While being generic, this framework is designed to minimize security loss, facilitating efficient parameter selection. A key feature of our work is the avoidance of random oracles in the security proof. Instead, we define explicit standard model requirements for the underlying hash functions. This eliminates the paradox of simultaneously treating hash functions as random oracles and as explicit circuits for aggregation. Furthermore, this provides cryptanalysts with clearly defined targets for evaluating the security of hash functions. Finally, we provide recommendations for practical instantiations of hash functions and concrete parameter settings, supported by known and novel heuristic bounds on the standard model properties.",

    "abstract": "The impossible boomerang attack is a very powerful attack, and the existing results show that it is more effective than the impossible differential attack in the related-key scenario. However, in the current key recovery process, the details of a block cipher are ignored, only fixed keys are pre-guessed, and the time complexity of the early abort technique is roughly estimated. These limitations are obstacles to the broader application of impossible boomerang attack. In this paper, we propose the pre-sieving technique, partial pre-guess key technique and precise complexity evaluation technique. For the pre-sieving technique, we capitalize on the specific features of both the linear layer and the nonlinear layer to expeditiously filter out the impossible quartets at the earliest possible stage. Regarding the partial pre-guess key technique, we are able to selectively determine the keys that require guessing according to our requirements. Moreover, the precise complexity evaluation technique empowers us to explicitly compute the complexity associated with each step of the attack. We integrate these techniques and utilize them to launch an attack on ARADI, which is a low-latency block cipher proposed by the NSA (National Security Agency) in 2024 for the purpose of memory encryption. Eventually, we achieve the first full-round attack with a data complexity of $2^{130}$, a time complexity of $2^{254.81}$, and a memory complexity of $2^{252.14}$. None of the previous key recovery methods have been able to attain such an outcome, thereby demonstrating the high efficacy of our new technique.",

    "abstract": "The increasing number of blockchain projects introduced annually has led to a pressing need for secure and efficient interoperability solutions. Currently, the lack of such solutions forces end-users to rely on centralized intermediaries, contradicting the core principle of decentralization and trust minimization in blockchain technology. In this paper, we propose a decentralized and efficient interoperability solution (aka Bridge Protocol) that operates without additional trust assumptions, relying solely on the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) of the two chains being connected. In particular, relayers (actors that exchange messages between networks) are permissionless and decentralized, hence eliminating any single point of failure. We introduce Random Sampling, a novel technique for on-chain light clients to efficiently follow the history of PoS blockchains by reducing the signature verifications required. Here, the randomness is drawn on-chain, for example, using Ethereum's RANDAO. We analyze the security of the bridge from a crypto- economic perspective and provide a framework to derive the security parameters. This includes handling subtle concurrency issues and randomness bias in strawman designs. While the protocol is applicable to various PoS chains, we demonstrate its feasibility by instantiating a bridge between Polkadot and Ethereum (currently deployed), and discuss some practical security challenges. We also evaluate the efficiency (gas costs) of an on-chain light-client verifier implemented as a smart contract on ethereum against SNARK-based approaches. Even for large validator set sizes (up to $10^6$), the signature verification gas costs of our light-client verifier are a magnitude lower.",

    "abstract": "Arithmetic hash functions defined over prime fields have been actively developed and used in verifiable computation (VC) protocols. Among those, elliptic-curve-based SNARKs require large (\\(256\\)-bit and higher) primes. Such hash functions are notably slow, losing a factor of up to \\(1000\\) compared to regular constructions like SHA-2/3.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present the hash function $\\textsf{Skyscraper}$, which is aimed at large prime fields and provides major improvements compared to $\\texttt{Reinforced Concrete}$ and $\\texttt{Monolith}$. First, the design is exactly the same for all large primes, which simplifies analysis and deployment. Secondly, it achieves a performance comparable to cryptographic hash standards by using low-degree non-invertible transformations and minimizing modulo reductions. Concretely, it hashes two \\(256\\)-bit prime field (BLS12-381 curve scalar field) elements in \\(135\\) nanoseconds, whereas SHA-256 needs \\(42\\) nanoseconds on the same machine.\r\n\r\nThe low circuit complexity of $\\textsf{Skyscraper}$, together with its high native speed, should allow a substantial reduction in many VC scenarios, particularly in recursive proofs.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the concept of Fair Signature Exchange (FSE). FSE enables a client to obtain signatures on multiple messages in a fair manner: the client receives all signatures if and only if the signer receives an agreed-upon payment. We formalize security definitions for FSE and present a practical construction based on the Schnorr signature scheme, avoiding computationally expensive cryptographic primitives such as SNARKs. Our scheme imposes minimal overhead on the Schnorr signer and verifier, leaving the signature verification process unchanged from standard Schnorr signatures. Fairness is enforced using a blockchain as a trusted third party, while exchanging only a constant amount of information on-chain regardless of the number of signatures exchanged. We demonstrate how to construct a batch adaptor signature scheme using FSE, and our FSE construction based on Schnorr results in an efficient implementation of a batch Schnorr adaptor signature scheme for the discrete logarithm problem. We implemented our scheme to show that it has negligible overhead compared to standard Schnorr signatures. For instance, exchanging $2^{10}$ signatures on the Vesta curve takes approximately $80$ms for the signer and $300$ms for the verifier, with almost no overhead for the signer and $2$x overhead for the verifier compared to the original Schnorr protocol. Additionally, we propose an extension to blind signature exchange, where the signer does not learn the messages being signed. This is achieved through a natural adaptation of blinded Schnorr signatures.",

    "abstract": "Multiparty computation (MPC) allows a set of mutually distrusting parties to compute a function over their inputs, while keeping those inputs private. Most recent MPC protocols that are ready for real-world applications are based on the so-called preprocessing model, where the MPC is split into two phases: a preprocessing phase, where raw material, independent of the inputs, is produced; and an online phase, which can be efficiently computed, consuming this preprocessed material, when the inputs become available. However, the sheer number of protocols following this paradigm, makes it difficult to navigate through the literature. Our work aims at systematizing existing literature, (1) to make it easier for protocol developers to choose the most suitable preprocessing protocol for their application scenario; and (2) to identify research gaps, so as to give\r\npointers for future work. We devise two main categories for the preprocessing model, which we term traditional and special preprocessing, where the former refers to preprocessing for general purpose functions, and the latter refers to preprocessing for specific functions. We further systematize the protocols based on the underlying cryptographic primitive they use, the mathematical structure they are based on, and for special preprocessing protocols also their target function. For each of the 41 presented protocols, we give the intuition behind their main technical contribution, and we analyze their security properties and relative performance.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a general framework for constructing SNARK-friendly post-quantum signature schemes based on minimal assumptions, specifically the security of an arithmetization-oriented family of permutations. The term \"SNARK-friendly\" here refers to the efficiency of the signature verification process in terms of SNARK constraints, such as R1CS or AIR constraints used in STARKs. Within the CAPSS framework, signature schemes are designed as proofs of knowledge of a secret preimage of a one-way function, where the one-way function is derived from the chosen permutation family. To obtain compact signatures with SNARK-friendly verification, our primary goal is to achieve a hash-based proof system that is efficient in both proof size and arithmetization of the verification process.\r\n\r\nTo this end, we introduce SmallWood, a hash-based polynomial commitment and zero-knowledge argument scheme tailored for statements arising in this context. The SmallWood construction leverages techniques from Ligero, Brakedown, and Threshold-Computation-in-the-Head (TCitH) to achieve proof sizes that outperform the state of the art of hash-based zero-knowledge proof systems for witness sizes ranging from $2^5$ to $2^{16}$.\r\n\r\nFrom the SmallWood proof system and further optimizations for SNARK-friendliness, the CAPSS framework offers a generic transformation of any arithmetization-oriented permutation family into a SNARK-friendly post-quantum signature scheme. We provide concrete instances built on permutations such as Rescue-Prime, Poseidon, Griffin, and Anemoi. For the Anemoi family, achieving 128-bit security, our approach produces signatures of sizes ranging from 9 to 13.3 KB, with R1CS constraints between 19K and 29K. This represents a 4-6$\\times$ reduction in signature size and a 5-8$\\times$ reduction in R1CS constraints compared to Loquat (CRYPTO 2024), a SNARK-friendly post-quantum signature scheme based on the Legendre PRF.",

    "abstract": "We revisit a basic building block in the endeavor to migrate to post-quantum secure cryptography, Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs). KEMs enable the establishment of a shared secret key, using only public communication. When targeting chosen-ciphertext security against quantum attackers, the go-to method is to design a Public-Key Encryption (PKE) scheme and then apply a variant of the  PKE-to-KEM conversion known as the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform, which we revisit in this work. Intuitively, FO ensures chosen-ciphertext security by rejecting dishonest messages. This comes in two flavors -- the KEM could reject by returning  'explicit' failure symbol $\\bot$ or instead by returning a pseudo-random key ('implicit' reject). During the NIST post-quantum standardization process, designers chose implicit rejection, likely due to the availability of security proofs against quantum attackers. On the other hand, implicit rejection introduces complexity and can easily deteriorate into explicit rejection in practice. While it was proven that implicit rejection is not less secure than explicit rejection, the other direction was less clear. This is relevant because the available security proofs against quantum attackers still leave things to be desired. When envisioning future improvements, due to, e.g., advancements in quantum proof techniques, having to treat both variants separately creates unnecessary overhead.\r\nIn this work, we thus re-evaluate the relationship between the two design approaches and address the so-far unexplored direction: in the classical random oracle model, we show that explicit rejection is not less secure than implicit rejection, up to a rare edge case. This, however, uses the observability of random oracle queries. To lift the proof into the quantum world, we make use of the extractable QROM (eQROM). As an alternative that works without the eQROM, we give an indirect proof that involves a new necessity statement on the involved PKE scheme.",

    "abstract": "Searchable encryption (SE) has been widely studied for cloud storage systems, allowing data encrypted search and retrieval. However, existing SE schemes can not support the fine-grained searchability revocation, making it impractical for real applications. Puncturable encryption (PE) [Oakland'15] can revoke the decryption ability of a data receiver for a specific message, which can potentially alleviate this issue. Moreover, the threat of quantum computing remains an important and realistic concern, potentially leading to data privacy leakage for cloud storage systems. Consequently, designing a post-quantum puncturable encrypted search scheme is still far-reaching. In this paper, we propose PunSearch, the first puncturable encrypted search scheme over lattice for outsourced data privacy-preserving in cloud storage systems. PunSearch provides a fine-grained searchability revocation while enjoying quantum safety. Different from existing PE schemes, we construct a novel trapdoor generation mechanism through evaluation algorithms and lattice pre-image sampling technique. We then design a search permission verification method to revoke the searchability for specific keywords. Furthermore, we formalize a new IND-Pun-CKA security model, and utilize it to analyze the security of PunSearch. Comprehensive performance evaluation indicates that the computational overheads of Encrypt, Trapdoor, Search, and Puncture algorithms in PunSearch are just 0.06, 0.005, 0.05, and 0.31 times of other prior arts, respectively under the best cases. These results demonstrate that PunSearch is effective and secure for cloud storage systems.",

    "abstract": "Many cryptographic protocols rely upon an initial \\emph{trusted setup} to generate public parameters.  While the concept is decades old, trusted setups have gained prominence with the advent of blockchain applications utilizing zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs), many of which rely on a ``powers-of-tau'' setup. Because such setups feature a dangerous trapdoor which undermines security if leaked, multiparty protocols are used to prevent the trapdoor from being known by any one party.  Practical setups utilize an elaborate public ceremony to build confidence that the setup was not subverted.  In this paper, we aim to systematize existing knowledge on trusted setups, drawing the distinction between setup \\emph{protocols} and \\emph{ceremonies}, and shed light on the different features of various approaches. We establish a taxonomy of protocols and evaluate real-world ceremonies based on their design principles, strengths, and weaknesses.",

    "abstract": "As Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables computation over encrypted data, it is a natural question of how efficiently it handles standard integer computations like $64$-bit arithmetic. It has long been believed that the CGGI/DM family or the BGV/BFV family are the best options, depending on the size of the parallelism. The Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme, although being widely used in many applications like machine learning, was not considered a good option as it is more focused on computing real numbers rather than integers.\r\n\r\nRecently, Drucker et al. [J. Cryptol.] suggested to use CKKS for discrete computations, by separating the error/noise from the discrete message. Since then, there have been several breakthroughs in the discrete variant of CKKS, including the CKKS-style functional bootstrapping by Bae et al. [Asiacrypt'24]. Notably, the CKKS-style functional bootstrapping can be regarded as a parallelization of CGGI/DM functional bootstrapping, and it is several orders of magnitude faster in terms of throughput. Based on the CKKS-style functional bootstrapping, Kim and Noh [ePrint, 2024/1638] designed an efficient homomorphic modular reduction for CKKS, leading to modulo small integer arithmetic.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is known that CKKS is efficient for handling small integers like $4$ or $8$ bits, it is still unclear whether its efficiency extends to larger integers like $32$ or $64$ bits. In this paper, we propose a novel method for homomorphic unsigned integer computations. We represent a large integer (e.g. $64$-bit) as a vector of smaller chunks (e.g. $4$-bit) and construct arithmetic operations relying on the CKKS-style functional bootstrapping. The proposed scheme supports many of the operations supported in TFHE-rs while outperforming it in terms of amortized running time. Notably, our homomorphic 64-bit multiplication takes $17.9$ms per slot, which is more than three orders of magnitude faster than TFHE-rs.",

    "abstract": "Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based protocols have shown great promise to improve the performance of blockchains. The CAP theorem shows that it is impossible to have a single system that achieves both liveness (known as dynamic availability) and safety under network partition.This paper explores two types of DAG-based protocols prioritizing liveness or safety, named structured dissemination and Graded Common Prefix (GCP), respectively. \r\n    \r\n    For the former, we introduce the first DAG-based protocol with constant expected latency, providing high throughput dynamic availability under the sleepy model. Its expected latency is $3\\Delta$ and its throughput linearly scales with participation. We validate these expected performance improvements over existing constant latency sleepy model BFT by running prototypes of each protocol across multiple machines.\r\n    \r\n    The latter, GCP, is a primitive that provides safety under network partition, while being weaker than standard consensus. As a result, we are able to obtain a construction that runs in only $2$ communication steps, as opposed to the $4$ steps of existing low latency partially synchronous BFT. In addition, GCP can easily avoid relying on single leaders' proposals, becoming more resilient to crashes. We also validate these theoretical benefits of GCP experimentally.\r\n    \r\n    We leverage our findings to extend the Ebb-and-Flow framework, where two BFT sub-protocols allow different types of clients in the same system to prioritize either liveness or safety. Our extension integrates our two types of DAG-based protocols. This provides a hybrid DAG-based protocol with high throughput, dynamical availability, and finality under network partitions, without running a standard consensus protocol twice as required in existing work.",

    "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies allow mutually distrusting users to transact monetary value over the internet without relying on a trusted third party.\r\n\r\nBitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, achieved this through a novel protocol used to establish consensus about an ordered transaction history.\r\nThis requires every transaction to be broadcasted and verified by the network, incurring communication and computational costs.\r\nFurthermore, transactions are visible to all nodes of the network, eroding privacy, and are recorded permanently, contributing to increasing storage requirements over time.\r\nTo limit resource usage of the network, Bitcoin currently supports an average of 11 transactions per second.\r\n\r\nMost cryptocurrencies today still operate in a substantially similar manner.\r\nPrivate cryptocurrencies like Zcash and Monero address the privacy issue by replacing transactions with proofs of transaction validity.\r\nHowever, this enhanced privacy comes at the cost of increased communication, storage, and computational requirements.\r\n\r\nClient-Side Validation (CSV) is a paradigm that addresses these issues by removing transaction validation from the blockchain consensus rules.\r\nThis approach allows sending the coin along with a validity proof directly to its recipient, reducing communication, computation and storage cost.\r\nCSV protocols deployed on Bitcoin today do not fully leverage the paradigm's potential, as they still necessitate the overhead of publishing ordinary Bitcoin transactions.\r\nMoreover, the size of their coin proofs is proportional to the coin's transaction history, and provide limited privacy.\r\nA recent improvement is the Intmax2 CSV protocol, which writes significantly less data to the blockchain compared to a blockchain transaction and has succinct coin proofs.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we introduce Shielded CSV, which improves upon state-of-the-art CSV protocols by providing the first construction that offers truly private transactions.\r\nIt addresses the issues of traditional private cryptocurrency designs by requiring only 64 bytes of data per transaction, called a nullifier, to be written to the blockchain.\r\nMoreover, for each nullifier in the blockchain, Shielded CSV users only need to perform a single Schnorr signature verification, while non-users can simply ignore this data.\r\nThe size and verification cost of coin proofs for Shielded CSV receivers is independent of the transaction history.\r\nThus, one application of Shielded CSV is adding privacy to Bitcoin at a rate of 100 transactions per second, provided there is an adequate bridging mechanism to the blockchain.\r\n\r\nWe specify Shielded CSV using the Proof Carrying Data (PCD) abstraction.\r\nWe then discuss two implementation strategies that we believe to be practical, based on Folding Schemes and Recursive STARKs, respectively.\r\nFinally, we propose future extensions, demonstrating the power of the PCD abstraction and the extensibility of Shielded CSV.\r\nThis highlights the significant potential for further improvements to the Shielded CSV framework and protocols built upon it.",

    "abstract": "One of the most basic properties of a consensus protocol is its fault-tolerance--the maximum fraction of faulty participants that the protocol can tolerate without losing fundamental guarantees such as safety and liveness. Because of its importance, the optimal fault-tolerance achievable by any protocol has been characterized in a wide range of settings. For example, for state machine replication (SMR) protocols operating in the partially synchronous setting, it is possible to simultaneously guarantee consistency against $\\alpha$-bounded adversaries (i.e., adversaries that control less than an $\\alpha$ fraction of the participants) and liveness against $\\beta$-bounded adversaries if and only if $\\alpha + 2\\beta \\leq 1$.\r\n\r\nThis paper characterizes to what extent ``better-than-optimal'' fault-tolerance guarantees are possible for SMR protocols when the standard consistency requirement is relaxed to allow a bounded number $r$ of consistency violations, each potentially leading to the rollback of recently finalized transactions. We prove that bounding rollback  is impossible without additional timing assumptions and investigate protocols that tolerate and recover from consistency violations whenever message delays around the time of an attack are bounded by a parameter $\\Delta^*$ (which may be arbitrarily larger than the parameter $\\Delta$ that bounds post-GST message delays in the partially synchronous model). Here, a protocol's fault-tolerance can be a non-constant function of $r$, and we prove, for each $r$, matching upper and lower bounds on the optimal ``recoverable fault-tolerance'' achievable by any SMR protocol. For example, for protocols that guarantee liveness against 1/3-bounded adversaries in the partially synchronous setting, a 5/9-bounded adversary can always cause one consistency violation but not two, and a 2/3-bounded adversary can always cause two consistency violations but not three.  Our positive results are achieved through a generic ``recovery procedure''  that can be grafted on to any accountable SMR protocol and restores consistency following a violation while rolling back only transactions that were finalized in the previous $2\\Delta^*$ timesteps.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption (HHE) is considered a promising solution for key challenges that emerge when adopting Homomorphic Encryption (HE). In cases such as communication and computation overhead for clients and storage overhead for servers, it combines symmetric cryptography with HE schemes. However, despite a decade of advancements, enhancing HHE usability, performance, and security for practical applications remains a significant stake.\r\nThis work contributes to the field by presenting a comprehensive analysis of prominent HHE schemes, focusing on their performance and security. We implemented three superior schemes--PASTA, HERA, and Rubato--using the Go programming language and evaluated their performance in a client-server setting. To promote open science and reproducibility, we have made our implementation publicly available on GitHub. \r\nFurthermore, we conducted an extensive study of applicable attacks on HHE schemes, categorizing them under algebraic-based, differential-based, linear-based, and LWE-based attacks. Our security analysis revealed that while most existing schemes meet theoretical security requirements, they remain vulnerable to practical attacks. These findings emphasize the need for improvements in practical security measures, such as defining standardized parameter sets and adopting techniques like noise addition to counter these attacks. \r\nThis survey provides insights and guidance for researchers and practitioners to design and develop secure and efficient HHE systems, paving the way for broader real-world adoption.",

    "abstract": "In various real-world situations, a client may need to verify whether specific data elements they possess are part of a set segmented among numerous data holders. \r\nTo maintain user privacy, it\u2019s essential that both the client\u2019s data elements and the data holders\u2019 sets remain encrypted throughout the process. \r\nExisting approaches like Private Set Intersection (PSI), Multi-Party PSI (MPSI), Private Segmented Membership Test (PSMT), and Oblivious RAM (ORAM) face challenges in these contexts.\r\nThey either require data holders to access the sets in plaintext, result in high latency when aggregating data from multiple holders, risk exposing the identity of the party with the matching element, cause a large communication overhead for multiple-element queries, or lead to high false positives.\r\n\r\nThis work introduces the primitive of a Private Segmented Membership Test (PSMT) for clients with multiple query elements. \r\nWe present a basic protocol for solving PSMT using a threshold variant of approximate-arithmetic homomorphic encryption, addressing the challenges of avoiding information leakage about the party with the intersection element, minimizing communication overhead for multiple query elements, and preventing false positives for a large number of data holders ensuring IND-CPA^D security.\r\nOur novel approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in scalability, supporting significantly more data holders.\r\nThis is achieved through a novel summation-based homomorphic membership check rather than a product-based one, as well as various novel ideas addressing technical challenges. \r\n\r\nOur new PSMT protocol supports a large number of parties and query elements (up to 4096 parties and 512 queries in experiments) compared to previous methods.\r\nOur experimental evaluation shows that our method's aggregation of results from 1024 data holders with a set size of 2^15 can run in 71.2s and only requires an additional 1.2 seconds per query for processing multiple queries.\r\nWe also compare our PSMT protocol to other state-of-the-art PSI and MPSI protocols and our previous work and discuss our improvements in usability with a better privacy model and a larger number of parties and queries.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we define the conditional constant function problem (CCFP) and, for a special case of CCFP, we propose a quantum algorithm for solving it efficiently. Such an algorithm enables us to make new evaluations to the quantum security of Feistel block cipher in the case  where a quantum adversary only has the ability to make online queries in a classical manner, which is relatively realistic. Specifically, we  significantly improved the chosen-plaintext key recovery attacks on two  Feistel block cipher variants known as  Feistel-KF and  Feistel-FK. For Feistel-KF, we construct a 3-round distinguisher based on the special case of CCFP and propose key recovery attacks mounting to $r>3$ rounds. For Feistel-FK, our CCFP based distinguisher covers 4 rounds and the key recovery attacks are applicable for $r>4$ rounds. Utilizing our CCFP solving algorithm,  we are able to reduce the classical memory complexity of our key recovery attacks from the previous exponential $O(2^{cn})$ to $O(1)$.\r\nThe query complexity of our key recovery attacks on Feistel-KF is also significantly reduced from  $O(2^{cn})$ to $O(1)$ where $c$'s are constants.\r\nOur key recovery results enjoy the current optimal complexities.\r\nThey also indicate that quantum algorithms solving CCFP could be more promising than those solving the period finding problem.",

    "abstract": "The CKKS scheme is traditionally recognized for approximate homomorphic encryption of real numbers, but BLEACH (Drucker et al., JoC 2024) extends its capabilities to handle exact computations on binary or small integer numbers. \r\n\r\nDespite this advancement,  BLEACH's approach of simulating XOR gates via $(a-b)^2$ incurs one multiplication per gate, which is computationally expensive in homomorphic encryption. To this end, we introduce XBOOT, a new framework built upon BLEACH's blueprint but allows for almost free evaluation of XOR gates. The core concept of XBOOT involves lazy reduction, where XOR operations are simulated with the less costly addition operation, $a+b$, leaving the management of potential overflows to later stages. We carefully handle the modulus chain and scale factors to ensure that the overflows would be conveniently rounded during the CKKS bootstrapping phase without extra cost. We use AES-CKKS transciphering as a benchmark to test the capability of XBOOT, and achieve a throughput exceeding one kilobyte per second, which represents a $2.5\\times$ improvement over the state-of-the-art (Aharoni et al., HES 2023). Moreover, XBOOT enables the practical execution of tasks with extensive XOR operations that were previously challenging for CKKS. For example, we can do Rasta-CKKS transciphering at over two kilobytes per second, more than $10\\times$  faster than the baseline without XBOOT.",

    "abstract": "Making the most of TFHE advanced capabilities such as programmable or circuit bootstrapping and their generalizations for manipulating data larger than the native plaintext domain of the scheme is a very active line of research. In this context, AES is a particularly interesting benchmark, as an example of a nontrivial algorithm which has eluded \"practical\" FHE execution performances for years, as well as the fact that it will most likely be selected by NIST as a flagship reference in its upcoming call on threshold (homomorphic) cryptography. Since 2023, the algorithm has thus been the subject of a renewed attention from the FHE community and has served as a playground to test advanced operators following the LUT-based, $p$-encodings or several variants of circuit bootstrapping, each time leading to further timing improvements. Still, AES is also interesting as a benchmark because of the tension between boolean- and byte-oriented operations within the algorithm. In this paper, we resolve this tension by proposing a new approach, coined \"Hippogryph\", which consistently combines the (byte-oriented) LUT-based approach with a generalization of the (boolean-oriented) $p$-encodings one to get the best of both worlds. In doing so, we obtain the best timings so far, getting a single-core execution of the algorithm over TFHE from 46 down to 32 seconds and approaching the 1 second barrier with only a mild amount of parallelism. We should also stress that all the timings reported in this paper are consistently obtained on the same machine which is often not the case in previous studies. Lastly, we emphasize that the techniques we develop are applicable beyond just AES since the boolean-byte tension is a recurrent issue when running algorithms over TFHE.",

    "abstract": "While many side-channel attacks on elliptic curve cryptography can be avoided by coordinate randomization, this is not the case for the zero-value point (ZVP) attack. This attack can recover a prefix of static ECDH key but requires solving an instance of the dependent coordinates problem (DCP), which is open in general. We design a new method for solving the DCP on GLV curves, including the Bitcoin secp256k1 curve, outperforming previous approaches. This leads to a new type of ZVP attack on multiscalar multiplication, recovering twice as many bits when compared to the classical ZVP attack. We demonstrate a $63\\%$ recovery of the private key for the interleaving algorithm for multiscalar multiplication. Finally, we analyze the largest database of curves and addition formulas with over 14 000 combinations and provide the first classification of their resistance against the ZVP attack.",

    "abstract": "The notion of funcCPA security for homomorphic encryption schemes was introduced by Akavia \\textit{et~al.}\\ (TCC 2022). Whereas it aims to capture the bootstrapping technique in homomorphic encryption schemes, Dodis \\textit{et~al.}\\ (TCC 2023) pointed out that funcCPA security can also be applied to non-homomorphic public-key encryption schemes (PKE). As an example, they presented a use case for privacy-preserving outsourced computation without homomorphic computation. It should be noted that prior work on funcCPA security, including the use case presented by Dodis \\textit{et~al.}, considered only the single-key setting. However, in recent years, multi-party collaboration in outsourced computation has garnered significant attention, making it desirable for funcCPA security to support the multi-key setting. Therefore, in this work, we introduce a new notion of security called Multi-Key funcCPA (MKfunc) to address this need, and show that if a PKE scheme is KDM-secure, then it is also MKfuncCPA secure. Furthermore, we show that similar discussions can be applied to symmetric-key encryption.",

    "abstract": "Secure Messaging apps have seen growing adoption, and are used by billions of people daily. However, due to imminent threat of a \"Harvest Now, Decrypt Later\" attack, secure messaging providers must react know in order to make their protocols $\\textit{hybrid-secure}$: at least as secure as before, but now also post-quantum (PQ) secure. Since many of these apps are internally based on the famous Signal's Double-Ratchet (DR) protocol, making Signal hybrid-secure is of great importance.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Signal and Apple already put in production various Signal-based variants with certain levels of hybrid security: PQXDH (only on the initial handshake), and PQ3 (on the entire protocol), by adding a $\\textit{PQ-ratchet}$ to the DR protocol. Unfortunately, due to the large communication overheads of the $\\mathsf{Kyber}$ scheme used by PQ3, real-world PQ3 performs this PQ-ratchet approximately every 50 messages. As we observe, the effectiveness of this amortization, while reasonable in the best-case communication scenario, quickly deteriorates in other still realistic scenarios; causing $\\textit{many consecutive}$ (rather than $1$ in $50$) re-transmissions of the same  $\\mathsf{Kyber}$ public keys and ciphertexts (of combined size 2272 bytes!).\r\n\r\nIn this work we design a new Signal-based, hybrid-secure secure messaging protocol, which significantly reduces the communication complexity of PQ3. We call our protocol \"the $\\textit{Triple Ratchet}$\" (TR) protocol. First, TR uses $\\textit{em erasure codes}$ to make the communication inside the PQ-ratchet provably balanced. This results in much better $\\textit{worst-case}$ communication guarantees of TR, as compared to PQ3. Second, we design a novel \"variant\" of $\\mathsf{Kyber}$, called $\\mathsf{Katana}$, with significantly smaller combined length of ciphertext and public key (which is the relevant efficiency measure for \"PQ-secure ratchets\"). For 192 bits of security, $\\mathsf{Katana}$ improves this key efficiency measure by over 37%: from 2272 to 1416 bytes. In doing so, we identify a critical security flaw in prior suggestions to optimize communication complexity of lattice-based PQ-ratchets, and fix this flaw with a novel proof relying on the recently introduced hint MLWE assumption.\r\n\r\nDuring the development of this work we have been in discussion with the Signal team, and they are actively evaluating bringing a variant of it into production in a future iteration of the Signal protocol.",

    "abstract": "Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX) has emerged as a crucial technology aimed at strengthening the isolation and security guarantees of virtual machines, especially as the demand for secure computation is growing largely. Despite the protections offered by TDX, in this work, we dig deep into the security claims and uncover an intricate observation in TDX. These findings undermine TDX's core security guarantees by breaching the isolation between the Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) and Trust Domains (TDs). In this work for the first time, we show through a series of experiments that these performance counters can also be exploited by the VMM to differentiate between activities of an idle and active TD. The root cause of this leakage is core contention. This occurs when the VMM itself, or a process executed by the VMM, runs on the same core as the TD. Due to resource contention on the core, the effects of the TD's computations become observable in the performance monitors collected by the VMM. This finding underscore the critical need for enhanced protections to bridge these gaps within these advanced virtualized environments.",

    "abstract": "Meet-in-the-middle (MitM) is a powerful approach for the cryptanalysis of symmetric primitives. In recent years, MitM has led to many improved records about key recovery, preimage and collision attacks with the help of automated tools. However, most of the previous work target $\\texttt{AES}$-like hashing where the linear layer is an MDS matrix. And we observe that their automatic model for MDS matrix is not suitable for primitives using a binary matrix as their linear layer.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose the $\\texttt{n-XOR}$ model to describe the $\\texttt{XOR}$ operation with an arbitrary number of inputs. And it can be applied to primitives with a binary matrix of arbitrary size. Then, we propose a check model to eliminate the possible inaccuracies caused by $\\texttt{n-XOR}$. But the check model is limited by the input size (not greater than 4). Combined with the two new models, we find a MitM key recovery attack on 11-round $\\texttt{Midori64}$. When the whitening keys are excluded, a MitM key recovery attack can be mounted on the 12-round $\\texttt{Midori64}$. Compared with the previous best work, both of the above results have distinct advantages in terms of reducing memory and data complexity. \r\nAt last, we apply the $\\texttt{n-XOR}$ model to the hashing modes of primitives with large size binary matrix. The preimage attack on weakened $\\texttt{camellia}-{\\tt MMO}$ (without $FL/FL^{-1}$ and whitening layers) and $\\texttt{Aria}-{\\tt DM}$ are both improved by 1 round.",

    "abstract": "Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) state machine replication (SMR) protocols form the basis of modern blockchains as they maintain a consistent state across all blockchain nodes while tolerating a bounded number of Byzantine faults. We analyze BFT SMR in the excessive fault setting where the actual number of Byzantine faults surpasses a protocol's tolerance. \r\n\r\nWe start by devising the very first repair algorithm for linearly chained and quorum-based partially synchronous SMR to recover from faulty states caused by excessive faults. Such a procedure can be realized using any commission fault detection module -- an algorithm that identifies the faulty replicas without falsely locating any correct replica. We achieve this with a slightly weaker liveness guarantee, as the original security notion is impossible to satisfy given excessive faults.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe implement recoverable HotStuff in Rust. The throughput resumes to the normal level (without excessive faults) after recovery routines terminate for $7$ replicas and is slightly reduced by $\\leq 4.3\\%$ for $30$ replicas. On average, it increases the latency by $12.87\\%$ for $7$ replicas \\usenix{and $8.85\\%$ for $30$ replicas}.\r\n\r\nAside from adopting existing detection modules, we also establish the sufficient condition for a general BFT SMR protocol to allow for complete and sound fault detection when up to $(n-2)$ Byzantine replicas (out of $n$ total replicas) attack safety. We start by providing the first closed-box fault detection algorithm for any SMR protocol without any extra rounds of communication. We then describe open-box instantiations of our fault detection routines in Tendermint and Hotstuff, further reducing the overhead, both asymptotically and concretely.",

    "abstract": "Threshold fully homomorphic encryption (ThFHE) enables multiple parties to compute functions over their sensitive data without leaking data privacy. Most of existing ThFHE schemes are restricted to full threshold and require the participation of all parties to output computing results. Compared with these full-threshold schemes, arbitrary threshold (ATh)-FHE schemes are robust to non-participants and can be a promising solution to many real-world applications. However, existing AThFHE schemes are either inefficient to be applied with a large number of parties $N$ and a large data size $K$, or insufficient to tolerate all types of non-participants. In this paper, we propose an AThFHE scheme to handle all types of non-participants with lower complexity over existing schemes. At the core of our scheme is the reduction from AThFHE construction to the design of a new primitive called approximate secret sharing (ApproxSS). Particularly, we formulate ApproxSS and prove the correctness and security of AThFHE on top of arbitrary-threshold (ATh)-ApproxSS's properties. Such a reduction reveals that existing AThFHE schemes implicitly design ATh-ApproxSS following a similar idea called ``noisy share''. Nonetheless, their ATh-ApproxSS design has high complexity and become the performance bottleneck. By developing ATASSES, an ATh-ApproxSS scheme based on a novel ``encrypted share'' idea, we reduce the computation (resp. communication) complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(N^2K)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(N^2+K)$ (resp. from $\\mathcal{O}(NK)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(N+K)$). We not only theoretically prove the (approximate) correctness and security of ATASSES, but also empirically evaluate its efficiency against existing baselines. Particularly, when applying to a system with one thousand parties, ATASSES achieves a speedup of $3.83\\times$ -- $15.4\\times$ over baselines.",

    "abstract": "Designing post-quantum digital signatures is a very active research area at present, with several protocols being developed, based on a variety of mathematical assumptions. Many of these signatures schemes can be used as a basis to define more advanced schemes, such as ring or threshold signatures, where multiple parties are involved in the signing process. Unfortunately, the majority of these protocols only considers a static adversary, that must declare which parties to corrupt at the beginning of the execution. However, a stronger security notion can be achieved, namely security against adaptive adversaries, that can corrupt parties at any times.\r\nIn this paper we tackle the challenges of designing a post-quantum adap- tively secure threshold signature scheme: starting from the GRASS sig- nature scheme, which is only static secure, we show that it is possible to turn it into an adaptive secure threshold signature that we call GRASS+. In particular, we introduce two variants of the classical GAIP problem and discuss their security. We prove that our protocol is adaptively secure in the Random Oracle Model, if the adversary corrupts only t 2 parties. We are also able to prove that GRASS+ achieves full adaptive security, with a corruption threshold of t, in the Black Box Group Action Model with Random Oracle. Finally, we improve the performance of the scheme by exploiting a better secret sharing, inspired from the work of Desmedt, Di Crescenzo, and Burmester from ASIACRYPT\u201994.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we revisit venerable lower-bounds on the $AT$ or $AT^2$\r\nperformance metric of hardware circuits. A series of works started in the late 1970's has established that if a hardware circuit of area $A$ computes a function $f : \\{0, 1\\}^n \\rightarrow \\{0, 1\\}^m$ in $T$ clock cycles, then $AT^2$ is asymptotically larger than (a form of) the communication complexity of $f$. These lower-bounds ignore the active component of the circuit such as the logic gates and only take into account the area of the wiring.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems that it is common practice to report the performance\r\ncharacteristics of hardware designs after synthesis, namely after having\r\n``compiled'' the design into the topological description of a hardware circuit made of standard cells. The area of the cells can be be determined with certainty, whereas the area occupied by the wires cannot. This may leads to optimistic performance figures, that may even violate the old lower-bounds.\r\n  \r\nIn this paper, we take the case of the M\u00f6bius transform as a case study, following the work of Banik and Regazzoni in TCHES, 2024(2) who presented hardware designs that implement it. We first determine the communication complexity of the M\u00f6bius transform. Then, following the old methodology, we derive lower-bounds on the area (in $\\mu m^2$) of any circuit that implement the operation using several open Process Design Kits for ASIC production. For large enough instances, the wires provably occupy more area than the logic gates themselves. This invalidate previous theoretical claims about the performance of circuits implementing the M\u00f6bius transform.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, the root cause of the contradiction between ``VLSI-era''\r\nlower-bounds and current performance claims is that the lower-bounds apply to  a geometric description of the circuit where the length of wiring is known, while it is common to report performance results on the basis of hardware synthesis alone, where a topological description of the circuit has been obtained but the actual length of wires is unknown.",

    "abstract": "We show that discrete Gaussian sampling for a $q$-ary lattice is equivalent to codeword sampling for a linear code over $\\mathbb{Z}_q$ with the Lee weight. This insight allows us to derive the theta series of a $q$-ary lattice from the Lee weight distribution of the associated code. We design a novel Gaussian sampler for $q$-ary lattices assuming an oracle that computes the symmetrized weight enumerator of the associated code.\r\nWe apply this sampler to well-known lattices, such as the $E_8$, Barnes-Wall, and Leech lattice, highlighting both its advantages and limitations, which depend on the underlying code properties. For certain root lattices, we show that the sampler is indeed efficient, forgoing the need to assume an oracle. We also discuss applications of our results in digital signature schemes and the Lattice Isomorphism Problem. In many cases, our sampler achieves a significant speed-up compared to state-of-the-art sampling algorithms in cryptographic applications.",

    "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies have emerged as a critical medium for digital financial transactions, driving widespread adoption while simultaneously exposing users to escalating fraud risks. The irreversible nature of cryptocurrency transactions, combined with the absence of consumer protection mechanisms, leaves users vulnerable to substantial financial losses and emotional distress. To address these vulnerabilities, we introduce Insured Cryptocurrency Transactions (ICT), a novel decentralized insurance framework designed to ensure financial recovery for honest users affected by fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions. We rigorously formalize the ICT framework, establishing strong security guarantees to protect against malicious adversaries. Furthermore, we present Insured Cryptocurrency Exchange (ICE), a concrete instantiation of ICT tailored for centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. ICE relies primarily on a standard smart contract and provides a robust mechanism to compensate users in cases of security breaches, insolvency, or fraudulent activities affecting the exchange. We have implemented ICE\u2019s smart contract and evaluated its on-chain costs. The evaluation results demonstrate ICE\u2019s low operational overhead. To our knowledge, ICT and ICE represent the first formal approaches to decentralized insurance frameworks in the cryptocurrency domain.",

    "abstract": "We introduce protein cryptography, a recently proposed method that encodes data into the amino acid sequences of proteins. Unlike traditional digital encryption, this approach relies on the inherent diversity, complexity, and replication resistance of biological macromolecules, making them highly secure against duplication or tampering. The experimental realization of protein cryptography remains an open problem. To accelerate experimental progress in this area, we provide an accessible and self-contained introduction to the fundamentals of cryptography for biologists with limited mathematical and computational backgrounds. Furthermore, we outline a framework for encoding, synthesizing, and decoding information using proteins. By enabling biologists to actively engage in the development of protein cryptography, this work bridges disciplinary boundaries and paves the way for applications in secure data storage.",

Its efficiency, both in software and hardware, has been demonstrated for integers commonly used in Elliptic Curve Cryptography. In recent papers, some authors introduce specific prime forms that are particularly well-suited for PMNS arithmetic. In this work, we extend their results to a broader class of prime numbers. In practice, our approach yields performance that is competitive with, and in some cases superior to, Pseudo-Mersenne arithmetic.

    "abstract": "This work explores the application and efficient deployment of (standardized) post-quantum (PQ) digital signature algorithms in the blockchain environment. Specifically, we implement and evaluate four PQ signatures in the Ethereum Virtual Machine: W-OTS$^{+}$, XMSS, SPHINCS+, and MAYO. We focus on optimizing the gas costs of the verification algorithms as that is the signature schemes' only algorithm executed on-chain, thus incurring financial costs (transaction fees) for the users. Hence, the verification algorithm is the signature schemes' main bottleneck for decentralized applications.\r\n\r\nWe examine two methods to verify post-quantum digital signatures on-chain. Our practical performance evaluation shows that full on-chain verification is often prohibitively costly. Naysayer proofs (FC'24) allow a novel optimistic verification mode. We observe that the Naysayer verification mode is generally the cheapest, at the cost of additional trust assumptions. We release our implementation called poqeth as an open-source library.",

    "abstract": "Our main result is a quantum polynomial-time reduction from the group action discrete logarithm (DLP) problem to a specific cloning problem. A consequence of this result is that the public-key quantum money scheme proposed by Zhandry (2024), based on abelian group actions, is secure in the generic group action model. Specifically, our result shows that breaking the quantum money scheme is equivalent, under quantum polynomial-time reductions, to solving the group action DLP. Two immediate implications of our results are: i) A separation between quantum money and quantum lightning. This separation arises because our reduction is non-uniform, and quantum lightning is not secure against non-uniform adversaries. ii) Cloning vs. preparing Fourier states. Our main theorem shows that the problem of cloning group action Fourier states is equivalent to the problem of preparing these states.",

    "abstract": "Data privacy concerns are sharply rising in the current digital era, hyperdriven by cloud computing, big data analytics, and the Internet of Things. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) has emerged as an ideal technique for computing on encrypted data, but current schemes suffer from slow encryption speed and large ciphertext expansion. Practical implementation is hindered, especially when the client has limited bandwidth, memory, and computing power. In 2011, Naehrig et al. proposed transciphering, reducing computational and communication overload on the client side. This involves symmetric ciphers with minimized multiplicative complexity, \r\nreferred to as HE-Friendly Ciphers (HEFCs). \r\n\r\nIn this work, we present a detailed study of transciphering for HE by systematizing existing knowledge and crystallizing research challenges. Particularly we conduct a comprehensive study on state-of-the-art HEFC constructions. Our work highlights gaps, open problems, and directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "Homomorphic secret sharing (HSS) is a distributed analogue of fully-homomorphic encryption (FHE), where subsequent to an input-sharing phase, parties can locally compute a function over their shares to obtain shares of the function output.\r\n\r\nOver the last decade, HSS schemes have been constructed from an array of different assumptions. However, all schemes require a public-key or correlated-randomness setup. This limitation carries over to the applications of HSS.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we construct multi-key homomorphic secret sharing (MKHSS), where given only a common reference string (CRS), two parties can secret share their inputs to each other and then perform local computations as in HSS. We present the first MKHSS schemes supporting all NC1 computations from either the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH), Decisional Composite Residuosity (DCR), or class group assumptions.\r\n\r\nOur constructions imply the following applications in the CRS model:\r\n\r\n- Succinct two-round secure computation. Under the same assumptions as our MKHSS schemes, we construct succinct, two-round secure two-party computation for NC1 circuits. Previously, such a result was only known from the learning with errors assumption.\r\n\r\n- Attribute-based NIKE. Under DCR or class group assumptions, we construct non-interactive key exchange (NIKE) protocols where two parties agree on a key if and only if their secret attributes satisfy a public NC1 predicate. This significantly generalizes the existing notion of password-based NIKE.\r\n\r\n- Public-key PCFs. Under DCR or class group assumptions, we construct public-key pseudorandom correlation functions (PCFs) for any NC1 correlation. This yields the first public-key PCFs for Beaver triples (and more) from non-lattice assumptions.\r\n\r\n- Silent MPC. Under DCR or class group assumptions, we construct a p-party secure computation protocol in the silent preprocessing model where the preprocessing phase has communication O(p), ignoring polynomial factors. All prior protocols that do not rely on spooky encryption require $\u03a9(p^2)$ communication.",

    "abstract": "Distributed Point Functions (DPFs) are a useful cryptographic primitive enabling a dealer to distribute short keys to two parties, such that the keys encode additive secret shares of a secret point function. However, in many applications of DPFs, no single dealer entity has full knowledge of the secret point function, necessitating the parties to run an interactive protocol to emulate the setup. Prior works have aimed to minimize complexity metrics of such distributed setup protocols, e.g., round complexity, while remaining black-box in the underlying cryptography.\r\n\r\nWe construct Non-Interactive DPFs (NIDPF), which have a one-round (simultaneous-message, semi-honest) setup protocol, removing the need for a trusted dealer. Specifically, our construction allows each party to publish a special \"public key\" to a public channel or bulletin board, where the public key encodes the party's secret function parameters. Using the public key of another party, any pair of parties can locally derive a DPF key for the point function parameterized by the two parties' joint inputs.\r\n\r\nWe realize NIDPF from an array of standard assumptions, including DCR, SXDH, QR, and LWE. Each party's public key is of size $O(N^{2/3})$, for point functions with a domain of size $N$, which leads to a sublinear communication setup protocol. The only prior approach to realizing such a non-interactive setup required using multi-key fully-homomorphic encryption or indistinguishability obfuscation.\r\n\r\nAs immediate applications of our construction, we get \"public-key setups\" for several existing constructions of pseudorandom correlation generators and round-efficient protocols for secure comparisons.",

    "abstract": "We put forth and instantiate a new primitive we call simultaneous-message and succinct (SMS) secure computation. An SMS scheme enables a minimal communication pattern for secure computation in the following scenario: Alice has a large private input X, Bob has a small private input y, and Charlie wants to learn $f(X, y)$ for some public function $f$.\r\n\r\nGiven a common reference string (CRS) setup phase, an SMS scheme for a function f is instantiated with two parties holding inputs $X$ and $y$, and has the following structure:\r\n\r\n- The parties simultaneously exchange a single message.\r\n- Communication is succinct, scaling sublinearly in the size of $X$ and the output $f(X, y)$.\r\n- Without further interaction, the parties can locally derive additive secret shares of $f(X, y)$.\r\n\r\nIn this way, an SMS scheme incurs a communication cost that is only twice that of the function output length. Importantly, the size of Alice's message does not grow with the size of her input $X$, and both Alice's and Bob's first-round messages grow sublinearly in the size of the output. Additionally, Alice's or Bob's view provides no information about the other party's input besides the output of $f(X, y)$, even if colluding with Charlie.\r\n\r\nWe obtain the following results:\r\n\r\n- Assuming Learning With Errors (LWE), we build an SMS scheme supporting evaluation of depth-$d$ circuits, where Alice's message is of size $|f(X, y)|^{(2/3)}$\u00b7 poly(\u03bb, d), Bob's message is of size $(|y| + |f(X, y)|^{(2/3)})$ \u00b7 poly(\u03bb, d), and \u03bb is the security parameter. We can further extend this to support all functions by assuming the circular security of LWE.\r\n\r\n- Assuming sub-exponentially secure indistinguishability obfuscation, in conjunction with other standard assumptions, we build an SMS scheme supporting arbitrary polynomial-sized batch functions of the form $(f(x_1, y), ..., f(x_L, y))$, for $X = (x_1, ..., x_L)$. The size of Alice's and Bob's messages in this construction is poly(\u03bb) and poly(\u03bb, |f|, log L), respectively.\r\n\r\nWe show that SMS schemes have several immediate applications. An SMS scheme gives:\r\n\r\n- A direct construction of trapdoor hash functions (TDH) (D\u00f6ttling et al., Crypto'19) for the same class of functions as the one supported by the SMS scheme.\r\n\r\n- A simple and generic compiler for obtaining compact, rate-1 fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) from any non-compact FHE scheme.\r\n\r\n- A simple and generic compiler for obtaining correlation-intractable (CI) hash functions that are secure against all efficiently-searchable relations.\r\n\r\nIn turn, under the LWE assumption, we obtain the first construction of TDH for all functions and generic approaches for obtaining rate-1 FHE and CI hashing. We also show that our iO-based construction gives an alternative approach for two-round secure computation with communication succinctness in the output length (Hub\u00e1\u010dek and Wichs, ITCS'15).",

    "abstract": "Ethereum transitioned from Proof-of-Work consensus to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus in September 2022. While this upgrade brings significant improvements (e.g., lower energy costs and higher throughput), it also introduces new vulnerabilities. One notable example is the so-called malicious \\textit{reorganization attack}. Malicious reorganization denotes an attack in which the Byzantine faulty validators intentionally manipulate the canonical chain so the blocks by honest validators are discarded. By doing so, the faulty validators can gain benefits such as higher rewards, lower chain quality, or even posing a liveness threat to the system. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we show that the majority of the known attacks on Ethereum PoS are some form of reorganization attacks. In practice, most of these attacks can be launched even if the network is synchronous (there exists a known upper bound for message transmission and processing). Different from existing studies that mitigate the attacks in an ad-hoc way, we take a systematic approach and provide an elegant yet efficient solution to reorganization attacks. Our solution is provably secure such that no reorganization attacks can be launched in a synchronous network. In a partially synchronous network, our approach achieves the conventional safety and liveness properties of the consensus protocol. Our evaluation results show that our solution is resilient to five types of reorganization attacks and also highly efficient.",

    "abstract": "We propose a decentralized asset-transfer system that enjoys full privacy: no party can learn the details of a transaction, except for its issuer and its recipient. Furthermore, the recipient is only aware of the amount of the transaction. Our system does not rely on consensus or synchrony assumptions, and therefore, it is responsive, since it runs at the actual network speed. Under the hood, every transaction creates a consumable coin equipped with a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof (NIZK) that confirms that the issuer has sufficient funds without revealing any information about her identity, the recipient's identity, or the payment amount. Moreover, we equip our system with a regulatory enforcement mechanism that can be used to regulate transfer limits or restrict specific addresses from sending or receiving funds, while preserving the system's privacy guarantees.\r\n        \r\nFinally, we report on Paxpay, our implementation of Fully Private Asset Transfer (FPAT) that uses the Gnark library for the NIZKs. In our benchmark, Paxpay exhibits better performance than earlier proposals that either ensure only partial privacy, require some kind of network synchrony or do not implement regulation features. Our system thus reconciles privacy, responsiveness, regulation enforcement and performance.",

    "abstract": "Quantum key leasing, also known as public key encryption with secure key leasing (PKE-SKL),\r\nallows a user to lease a (quantum) secret key to a server for decryption purpose, with the capability of revoking the key afterwards.\r\nIn the pioneering work by Chardouvelis et al (arXiv:2310.14328), a PKE-SKL scheme utilizing classical channels was successfully built upon the noisy trapdoor claw-free (NTCF) family. This approach, however, relies on the superpolynomial hardness of learning with errors (LWE) problem, which could affect both efficiency and security of the scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our work, we demonstrate that the reliance on superpolynomial hardness is unnecessary, and that LWE with polynomial-size modulus is sufficient to achieve the same goal. \r\nOur approach enhances both efficiency and security, thereby improving the practical feasibility of the scheme on near-term quantum devices.\r\nTo accomplish this, we first construct a \\textit{noticeable} NTCF (NNTCF) family with the adaptive hardcore bit property, based on LWE with polynomial-size modulus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the adaptive hardcore bit property based on LWE with polynomial-size modulus, which may be of independent interest.\r\nBuilding on this foundation, we address additional challenges in prior work to construct the first PKE-SKL scheme satisfying the following properties:\r\n(\\textit{i}) the entire protocol utilizes only classical communication, and can also be lifted to support homomorphism.\r\n(\\textit{ii}) the security is solely based on LWE assumption with polynomial-size modulus.\r\n\r\nAs a demonstration of the versatility of our noticeable NTCF, we show that an efficient proof of quantumness protocol can be built upon it. Specifically, our protocol enables a classical verifier to test the quantumness while relying exclusively on the LWE assumption with polynomial-size modulus.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of quantum computers, proofs of quantumness have recently become an interesting and intriguing research direction. However, in all current schemes for proofs of quantumness, quantum provers almost invariably face the risk of being maliciously exploited by classical verifiers. In fact, through malicious strategies in interaction with quantum provers, classical verifiers could solve some instances of hard problems that arise from the specific scheme in use. In other words, malicious verifiers can break some schemes (that quantum provers are not aware of) through interaction with quantum provers. All this is due to the lack of formalization that prevents malicious verifiers from extracting useful information in proofs of quantumness.\r\n\r\nTo address this issue, we formalize zero-knowledge proofs of quantumness. Intuitively, the zero-knowledge property necessitates that the information gained by the classical verifier from interactions with the quantum prover should not surpass what can be simulated using a simulated classical prover interacting with the same verifier. As a result, the new zero-knowledge notion can prevent any malicious verifier from exploiting quantum advantage.\r\nInterestingly, we find that the classical zero-knowledge proof is sufficient to compile some existing proofs of quantumness schemes into zero-knowledge proofs of quantumness schemes.\r\n\r\nDue to some technical reasons, it appears to be more general to require zero-knowledge proof on the verifier side instead of the prover side. Intuitively, this helps to regulate the verifier's behavior from malicious to be honest-but-curious. As a result, both parties will play not only one role in the proofs of quantumness but also the dual role in the classical zero-knowledge proof. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the two principle proofs of quantumness schemes: Shor's factoring-based scheme and learning with errors-based scheme in [Brakerski et al, FOCS, 2018], can be transformed into zero-knowledge proofs of quantumness by requiring an extractable non-interactive zero-knowledge argument on the verifier side. \r\nNotably, the zero-knowledge proofs of quantumness can be viewed as an enhanced security notion for proofs of quantumness. To prevent malicious verifiers from exploiting the quantum device's capabilities or knowledge, it is advisable to transition existing proofs of quantumness schemes to this framework whenever feasible.",

    "abstract": "As cloud-based quantum computing services, such as those offered by D-Wave, become more popular for practical applications, privacy-preserving methods (such as obfuscation) are essential to address data security, privacy, and legal compliance concerns.\r\nSeveral efficient obfuscation methods have been proposed, which do not increase the time complexity of solving the obfuscated problem, for quantum optimization problems. These include {\\em sign reversing}, {\\em variable permutation}, and the combination of both methods assumed to provide greater protection. Unfortunately, sign reversing has already been shown to be insecure. \r\n\r\nWe present two attacks on variable permutation and the combined method, where it is possible to efficiently recover the deobfuscated problem, particularly when given access to the obfuscated problem and its obfuscated solution, as a cloud-based quantum provider would have.\r\nOur attacks are in the context of an optimization problem of cryptanalysis of the Trivium cipher family, but our approach generalizes to other similarly structured problems.\r\n\r\nOur attacks are efficient and practical.\r\nDeobfuscating an optimization problem with \\( n \\) variables obfuscated with the combined method has a complexity of $O(n^2)$ compared to the complexity of $O\\left( n \\cdot n! \\cdot 2^n \\right)$ of the brute force attack.\r\nWe provide an implementation of our attack; using a commodity laptop, our attack using the full Trivium cipher takes less than two minutes if optimized.\r\nWe also present possible countermeasures to mitigate our attacks and bring attention to the need for further development in this area.",

    "abstract": "Skyscraper is a cryptographic permutation published in TCHES 2025, optimized for use in proof systems such as PlonK. This primitive is based on a 10-round Feistel network combining $x^2$ monomials and lookup-based functions to achieve competitive plain performances and efficiency in proof systems supporting lookups. In terms of security, the $x^2$ monomials are supposed to provide security against statistical attacks, while lookups are supposed to provide security against algebraic attacks.\r\n\r\nIn this note, we show that this primitive has a much lower security margin than expected. Using a rebound attack, we find practical truncated differentials on the full permutation. As a corollary, we also find a practical collision attack on the compression function based on a 9-round Skyscraper permutation, which significantly reduces the security margin of the primitive. All of these attacks have been implemented and work in practice.",

    "abstract": "Boolean formula minimization is a notoriously hard problem that is known to be $\\varSigma_2^P$-complete. Circuit minimization, typically studied in the context of a much broader subject known as synthesis and optimization of circuits, introduces another layer of complexity since ultimately those technology-independent epresentations (e.g., Boolean formulas and truth tables) has to be transformed into a netlist of cells of the target technology library. To manage those complexities, the industrial community typically separates the synthesis process into two steps: technology-independent optimization and technology mapping. In each step, this approach only tries to find the local optimal solution and relies heavily on heuristics rather than a systematic search. However, for small S-boxes, a more systematic exploration of the design space is possible. Aiming at the global optimum, we propose a method which can synthesize a truth table for a small S-box directly into a netlist of the cells of a given technology library. Compared with existing technology-dependent synthesis tools like LIGHTER and PEIGEN, our method produces improved results for many S-boxes with respect to circuit area. In particular, by applying our method to the $\\mathbb{F}_{2^4}$-inverter involved in the tower field implementation of the AES S-box, we obtain the currently known lightest implementation of the AES S-box. The search framework can be tweaked to take circuit delay into account. As a result, we find implementations for certain S-boxes with both latency and area improved.",

    "abstract": "Introduced by Halevi, Ishai, Kushilevitz, and Rabin (CRYPTO 2023), Additive randomized encodings (ARE) reduce the computation of a $k$-party function $f(x_1,\\dots,x_k)$ to locally computing encodings $\\hat x_i$ of each input $x_i$ and then adding them together over some Abelian group into an output encoding $\\hat y = \\sum \\hat x_i$, which reveals nothing but the result. The appeal of ARE comes from the simplicity of the non-local computation, involving only addition. This gives rise for instance to non-interactive secure function evaluation in the shuffle model where messages from different parties are anonymously shuffled before reaching their destination. Halevi, Ishai, Kushilevitz, and Rabin constructed ARE based on Diffie-Hellman type assumptions in bilinear groups.\r\n\r\nWe construct ARE assuming public-key encryption. The key insight behind our construction is that one-sided ARE, which only guarantees privacy for one of the parties, are relatively easy to construct, and yet can be lifted to full-fledged ARE. We also give a more efficient black-box construction from the CDH assumption.",

    "abstract": "A memory checking argument enables a prover to prove to a verifier that it is correctly processing reads and writes to memory. They are used widely in modern SNARKs, especially in zkVMs, where the prover proves the correct execution of a CPU including the correctness of memory operations.\r\n\r\nWe describe a new approach for memory checking, which we call the method of one-hot addressing and increments. We instantiate this method via two different families of protocols, called Twist and Shout. Twist supports read/write memories, while Shout targets read-only memories (also known as lookup arguments). Both Shout and Twist have logarithmic verifier costs. Unlike prior works, these protocols do not invoke \"grand product\" or \"grand sum\" arguments.\r\n\r\nTwist and Shout significantly improve the prover costs of prior works across the full range of realistic memory sizes, from tiny memories (e.g., 32 registers as in RISC-V), to memories that are so large they cannot be explicitly materialized (e.g., structured lookup tables of size $2^{64}$ or larger, which arise in Lasso and the Jolt zkVM). Detailed cost analysis shows that Twist and Shout are well over 10x cheaper for the prover than state-of-the-art memory-checking procedures configured to have logarithmic proof length.\r\n\r\nPrior memory-checking procedures can also be configured to have larger proofs. Even then, we estimate that Twist and Shout are at least 2--4x faster for the prover in key applications. \r\n \r\nFinally, using Shout, we provide two fast-prover SNARKs for non-uniform constraint systems, both of which achieve minimal commitment costs (the prover commits only to the witness): (1) SpeedySpartan applies to Plonkish constraints, substantially improving the previous state-of-the-art protocol, BabySpartan; and (2)Spartan++ applies to CCS (a generalization of Plonkish and R1CS), improving prover times over the previous state-of-the-art protocol, Spartan, by 6x.",

    "abstract": "We present a new lattice-based signature scheme, called \u2018NTRU+Sign\u2019, using the Fiat-Shamir with Aborts framework. The proposed scheme is designed based on a novel NTRU-based key structure that fits well with bimodal distributions, enabling efficiency improvements compared to its predecessor, BLISS. The novel NTRU-based key structure is characterized by: (1) effectively changing a modulus from 2q to q, which is different from the existing usage of 2q for bimodal distributions, and (2) drastically reducing the magnitude of a secret key, which directly leads to compactness of signature sizes. We provide two concrete parameter sets for NTRU+Sign, supporting 93-bit and 211-bit security levels. Using the technique from GALACTICS (that was suggested as the constant-time implementation of BLISS),\r\nour analysis shows that NTRU+Sign achieves a good balance between computational efficiency and signature compactness, with constant-time implementation. For instance, at the NIST-3 security level, NTRU+Sign produces signatures that are significantly smaller than Dilithium and HAETAE, while providing faster verification speeds. These advantages position NTRU+Sign as a competitive and practical\r\nsolution for real-world deployments.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents dCTIDH, a CSIDH implementation that combines two recent developments into a novel state-of-the-art deterministic implementation. We combine the approach of deterministic variants of CSIDH with the batching strategy of CTIDH, which shows that the full potential of this key space has not yet been explored. This high-level adjustment in itself leads to a significant speed-up. To achieve an effective deterministic evaluation in constant time, we introduce Wombats, a new approach to performing isogenies in batches, specifically tailored to the behavior required for deterministic CSIDH using CTIDH batching. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, we explore the two-dimensional space of optimal primes for dCTIDH, with regard to both the performance of dCTIDH in terms of finite-field operations per prime and the efficiency of finite-field operations, determined by the prime shape, in terms of cycles. This allows us to optimize both for choice of prime and scheme parameters simultaneously. Lastly, we implement and benchmark constant-time, deterministic dCTIDH. Our results show that dCTIDH not only outperforms state-of-the-art deterministic CSIDH, but even non-deterministic CTIDH: dCTIDH-2048 is faster than CTIDH-2048 by 17 percent, and is almost five times faster than dCSIDH-2048.",

    "abstract": "The adoption of Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Secure\r\nFunction Evaluation (SFE) applications in the real world remains lim-\r\nited, even nearly 50 years after the introduction of HE. This is particu-\r\nlarly unfortunate given the strong privacy and confidentiality guarantees\r\nthese tools can offer to modern digital life.\r\nWhile attempting to incorporate a simple straw-man PSI protocol into\r\na web service for matching individuals based on their profiles, we en-\r\ncountered several shortcomings in current outsourcing frameworks. Ex-\r\nisting outsourced protocols either require clients to perform tasks beyond\r\nmerely contributing their inputs or rely on a non-collusion assumption\r\nbetween a server and a client, which appears implausible in standard web\r\nservice scenarios.\r\nTo address these issues, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first\r\ngeneral construction for non-interactive outsourced computation based\r\non black-box homomorphic encryption. This approach relies on a non-\r\ncollusion assumption between two dedicated servers, which we consider\r\nmore realistic in a web-service setting. Furthermore, we provide a proof\r\nof our construction within the Universal Composability (UC) framework,\r\nassuming semi-honest (i.e., passive) adversaries.\r\nUnlike general one-sided two-party SFE protocols, our construction addi-\r\ntionally requires sender privacy. Specifically, the sender must contribute\r\nits inputs solely in encrypted form. This ensures stronger privacy guar-\r\nantees and broadens the applicability of the protocol.\r\nOverall, the range of applications for our construction includes all one-\r\nsided two-party sender-private SFE protocols as well as server-based\r\narithmetic computations on encrypted inputs. Finally, we demonstrate\r\nthe practical applicability of our general outsourced computation frame-\r\nwork by applying it to the specific use case of Outsourced Private Set\r\nIntersection (OPSI) in a real-world scenario, accompanied by a detailed\r\nevaluation of its efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Homomorphic signatures for NP (HSNP) allow proving that a signed value is the result of a non-deterministic computation on signed inputs. At CCS'22, Fiore and Tucker introduced HSNP, showed how to use them for verifying arbitrary computations on data streams, and proposed a generic HSNP construction obtained by efficiently combining zkSNARKs with linearly homomorphic signatures (LHS), namely those supporting linear functions. Their proposed LHS however suffered from an high verification cost. In this work we propose an efficient LHS that significantly improves on previous work in terms of verification time. Using the modular approach of Fiore and Tucker, this yields a verifier-efficient HSNP. We show that the HSNP instantiated with our LHS is particularly suited to the case when the data is taken from consecutive samples, which captures important use cases including sliding window statistics such as variances, histograms and stock market predictions.",

    "abstract": "Twisted generalized Reed-Solomon (TGRS) codes constitute an interesting family of evaluation codes, containing a large class of maximum distance separable codes non-equivalent to generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) ones.\r\nMoreover, the Schur squares of TGRS codes may be much larger than those of GRS codes with same dimension.\r\nExploiting these structural differences, in 2018, Beelen, Bossert, Puchinger and Rosenkilde proposed a subfamily of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) Twisted Reed--Solomon (TRS) codes over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ with $\\ell$ twists $q \\approx n^{2^{\\ell}}$ for McEliece encryption, claiming their resistance to both Sidelnikov Shestakov attack and\r\nSchur products--based attacks. In short, they claimed these codes to resist to classical key recovery attacks on McEliece encryption scheme instantiated with Reed-Solomon (RS) or GRS codes. In 2020, Lavauzelle and Renner presented an original attack on this system based on the computation of the subfield subcode of the public TRS code.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we show that the original claim on the resistance of TRS and TGRS codes to Schur products based--attacks is wrong.\r\nWe identify a broad class of codes including TRS and TGRS ones that is distinguishable from random by computing the Schur square\r\nof some shortening of the code. Then, we focus on the case of single twist ({i.e.}, $\\ell = 1$), which is the most efficient one in terms of decryption complexity, to derive an attack. The technique is similar to the distinguisher-based attacks of RS code-based systems given by Couvreur, Gaborit, Gauthier-Uma\u00f1a, Otmani, Tillich in 2014.",

    "abstract": "The Stealth Address Protocol (SAP) allows users to receive assets through stealth addresses that are unlinkable to their stealth meta-addresses. The most widely used SAP, Dual-Key SAP (DKSAP), and the most performant SAP, Elliptic Curve Pairing Dual-Key SAP (ECPDKSAP), are based on elliptic curve cryptography, which is vulnerable to quantum attacks. These protocols depend on the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem, which could be efficiently solved on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer using the Shor algorithm. In this paper three novel post-quantum SAPs based on lattice-based cryptography are presented: LWE SAP, Ring-LWE SAP and Module-LWE SAP. These protocols leverage Learning With Errors (LWE) problem to ensure quantum-resistant privacy. Among them, Module-LWE SAP, which is based on the Kyber key encapsulation mechanism, achieves the best performance and outperforms ECPDKSAP by approximately 66.8% in the scan time of the ephemeral public key registry.",

    "abstract": "We propose efficient, post-quantum threshold ring signatures constructed from one-wayness of AES encryption and the VOLE-in-the-Head zero-knowledge proof system. Our scheme scales efficiently to large rings and extends the linkable ring signatures paradigm. We define and construct key-binding deterministic tags for signature linkability, that also enable succinct aggregation with approximate lower bound arguments of knowledge; this allows us to achieve succinct aggregation of our signatures without SNARKs. Finally, we extend our threshold ring signatures to realize post-quantum anonymous ledger transactions in the spirit of Monero. Our constructions assume symmetric key primitives only. \r\nWhilst it is common to build post-quantum signatures from the one-wayness property of AES and a post-quantum NIZK scheme, we extend this paradigm to define and construct novel security properties from AES that are useful for advanced signature applications. We introduce key-binding and pseudorandomness of AES to establish linkability and anonymity of our threshold ring signatures from deterministic tags, and similarly establish binding and hiding properties of block ciphers modeled as ideal permutations to build commitments from AES, a crucial building block for our proposed post-quantum anonymous ledger scheme.",

    "abstract": "We construct the first tightly secure signature schemes in the multi-user setting with adaptive corruptions from classical discrete logarithm, RSA,  factoring, or post-quantum group action discrete logarithm assumption. In contrast to our scheme, the previous tightly secure schemes are based on the decisional assumption (e.g., (group action) DDH) or interactive search assumptions (e.g., one-more CDH). \r\nThe security of our schemes is independent of the number of users, signing queries, and RO queries, and forging our signatures is as hard as solving the underlying search problem. Our starting point is an identification scheme with multiple secret keys per public key (e.g., Okamoto identification (CRYPTO'92) and parallel-OR identification (CRYPTO'94)). This property allows a reduction to solve a search problem while answering corruption queries for all users in the signature security game. To convert such an identification scheme into a signature scheme tightly, we employ randomized Fischlin's transformation introduced by Kondi and shelat (Asiacrypt 2022) that provides straight-line extraction. Intuitively, the transformation properties guarantee the tight security of our signature scheme in the programmable random oracle model, but we successfully prove its tight security in the non-programmable random oracle model.",

    "abstract": "CROSS is a post-quantum secure digital signature scheme submitted to NIST\u2019s Call for Additional Signatures which was recently selected for round 2. It features signature and key sizes in the range of SLH-DSA while providing a substantially faster signing operation. Within this work, we provide the first passive side-channel attack on the scheme. The attack recovers the secret key from all except one parameter sets from a single power trace while requiring at maximum two power traces for the R-SDP(G) 1 Fast instance. To successfully mount the attack, we show how to recover the secret key from side-channel information gained from the syndrome computation in CROSS\u2019 identification protocol. We furthermore show how the hypothesis space for the attack can be restricted using information from the published signature.",

    "abstract": "Post-quantum signatures have high costs compared to RSA and ECDSA, in particular for smart cards. A line of work originating from Even, Goldreich, and Micali (CRYPTO'89) aimed to reduce digital signature latency by splitting up signing into an online and offline phase. The online/offline paradigm combines an ordinary long-term signature scheme with a fast, generally one-time, signature scheme. We reconsider this paradigm in the context of lattice-based post-quantum signatures in the GPV framework, with an example instantiation based on Falcon.",

    "abstract": "The Fiat-Shamir (FS) transform is a prolific and powerful technique for compiling public-coin interactive protocols into non-interactive ones. Roughly speaking, the idea is to replace the random coins of the verifier with the evaluations of a complex hash function.\r\n    \r\nThe FS  transform is known to be sound in the random oracle model (i.e., when the hash function is modeled as a totally random function). However, when instantiating the random oracle using a concrete hash function, there are examples of  protocols in which the transformation is not sound. So far all of these examples have been contrived protocols that were specifically designed to fail.\r\n\r\nIn this work we show such an attack for a standard and popular interactive succinct argument, based on the GKR protocol, for verifying the correctness of a non-determinstic bounded-depth computation. For every choice of FS hash function, we show that a corresponding instantiation of this protocol, which was been widely studied in the literature and used also in practice, is not (adaptively) sound when compiled with the FS transform. Specifically, we construct an explicit circuit for which we can generate an accepting proof for a false statement.\r\n    \r\nWe further extend our attack and show that for every circuit $C$ and desired output $y$, we can construct a functionally equivalent circuit $C^*$, for which we can produce an accepting proof that $C^*$ outputs $y$ (regardless of whether or not this statement is true). This demonstrates that any security guarantee (if such exists) would have to depend on the specific implementation of the circuit $C$, rather than just its functionality.\r\n\r\nLastly, we also demonstrate versions of the attack that violate non-adaptive soundness of the protocol -- that is, we generate an attacking circuit that is independent of the underlying cryptographic objects. However, these versions are either less practical (as the attacking circuit has very large depth) or make some additional (reasonable) assumptions on the underlying cryptographic primitives.",

    "abstract": "PAKE protocols are used to establish secure communication channels using a relatively short, often human memorable, password for authentication. The currently standardized PAKEs however rely on classical asymmetric (public key) cryptography. Thus, these classical PAKEs may no longer maintain their security, should the expected quantum threat become a reality. Unlike prominent security protocols such as TLS, IKEv2 and VPN, quantum-safe PAKEs did not receive much attention from the ongoing PQC integration efforts. Thus, there is a significant gap in awareness compared to PQC schemes that are subject to the official governmental and institutional standardization processes. In the work at hand, we provide a comprehensive overview of the existing PQC PAKEs focusing on their design rationales, authentication methods and used asymmetric key agreement primitives. We highlight their performance and properties as per their assumed security assurances and practical usage in applications. Moreover, we address PAKE designs that are still non-present in the PQC realm and discuss the possibility of their adaptation. Thus, we offer a detailed reference and derive future work for quantum-safe PAKEs.",

    "abstract": "The Module Learning with Errors ($\\mathsf{MLWE}$) problem is one of the most commonly used hardness assumption in lattice-based cryptography. In its standard version, a matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is sampled uniformly at random over a quotient ring $R_q$, as well as noisy linear equations in the form of $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{s}+ \\mathbf{e} \\bmod q$, where $\\mathbf{s}$ is the secret, sampled uniformly at random over $R_q$, and $\\mathbf{e}$ is the error, coming from a Gaussian distribution.  Many previous works have focused on variants of $\\mathsf{MLWE}$, where the secret and/or the error are sampled from different distributions. Only few works have focused on different distributions for the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$. One variant proposed in the literature is to consider matrix distributions where the low-order bits of a uniform $\\mathbf{A}$ are deleted. This seems a natural approach in order to save in bandwidth. We call it truncated $\\mathsf{MLWE}$.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we show that the hardness of standard $\\mathsf{MLWE}$ implies the hardness of truncated $\\mathsf{MLWE}$, both for search and decision versions. Prior works only covered the search variant and relied on the (module) $\\mathsf{NTRU}$ assumption, limitations which we are able to overcome. Overall, we provide two approaches, offering different advantages. The first uses a general R\u00e9nyi divergence argument, applicable to a wide range of secret/error distributions, but which only works for the search variants of (truncated) $\\mathsf{MLWE}$. The second applies to the decision versions, by going through an intermediate variant of $\\mathsf{MLWE}$, where additional hints on the secret are given to the adversary. However, the reduction makes use of discrete Gaussian distributions.",

    "abstract": "In a single secret leader election (SSLE) protocol, all parties collectively and obliviously elect one leader. No one else should learn its identity unless it reveals itself as the leader. The problem is first formalized by Boneh \\textit{et al.} (AFT'20), which proposes an efficient construction based on the Decision Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption. Considering the potential risk of quantum computers, several follow-ups focus on designing a post-quantum secure SSLE protocol based on pure lattices or fully homomorphic encryption. However, no concrete benchmarks demonstrate the feasibility of deploying such heavy cryptographic primitives.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we present Qelect, the first practical constant-round post-quantum secure SSLE protocol. We first adapt the commitment scheme in Boneh \\textit{et al.} (AFT'23) into a \\textit{multi-party randomizable commitment} scheme, and propose our novel construction based on an adapted version of ring learning with errors (RLWE) problem. We then use it as a building block and construct a \\textit{constant-round} single secret leader election (crSSLE) scheme. We utilize the single instruction multiple data (SIMD) property of a specific threshold fully homomorphic encryption (tFHE) scheme to evaluate our election circuit efficiently. Finally, we built Qelect from the crSSLE scheme, with performance optimizations including a preprocessing phase to amortize the local computation runtime and a retroactive detection phase to avoid the heavy zero-knowledge proofs during the election phase. Qelect achieves asymptotic improvements and is concretely practical. We implemented a prototype of Qelect and evaluated its performance in a WAN. Qelect is at least two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we report on the latest GPU implementations of the three well-known methods for the key switching operation, which is critical for Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). Additionally, for the first time in the literature, we provide implementations of all three methods in GPU for leveled CKKS schemes. To ensure a fair comparison, we employ the most recent GPU implementation of the number-theoretic transform (NTT), which is the most time-consuming operation in key switching, and evaluate the performance across two fully homomorphic schemes: BFV and CKKS. Furthermore, we highlight the advantages and shortcomings of the three methods in the context of leveled HE schemes, and discuss other aspects such as memory requirements. Our GPU implementation is integrated with HEonGPU Library and delivers up to a \u00d7380 improvement in execution time compared to the Microsoft SEAL Library. Since key switching is a specialized form of the external product common in many HE schemes, our results are directly relevant to time-intensive homomorphic operations such as relinearization and rotation. As homomorphic rotation is one of the most dominant operations in bootstrapping, our results are also applicable in bootstrapping algorithms of BFV, BGV and CKKS schemes.",

    "abstract": "The Classical Bloom Filter (CBF) is a class of Probabilistic Data Structures (PDS) for handling Approximate Query Membership (AMQ). The Learned Bloom Filter (LBF) is a recently proposed class of PDS that combines the Classical Bloom Filter with a Learning Model while preserving the Bloom Filter's one-sided error guarantees. Bloom Filters have been used in settings where inputs are sensitive and need to be private in the presence of an adversary with access to the Bloom Filter through an API or in the presence of an adversary who has access to the internal state of the Bloom Filter. Prior work has investigated the privacy of the Classical Bloom Filter providing attacks and defenses under various privacy definitions. In this work, we formulate a stronger differential privacy-based model for the Bloom Filter. We propose constructions of the Classical and Learned Bloom Filter that satisfy $(\\epsilon, 0)$-differential privacy. This is also the first work that analyses and addresses the privacy of the Learned Bloom Filter under any rigorous model, which is an open problem.",

    "abstract": "With the development of decentralized identity (DID), anonymous credential (AC) technology, as well as its traceability, is receiving more and more attention. Most works introduce a trusted party (regulator) that holds a decryption key or backdoor to directly deanonymize the user identity of anonymous authentication. While some cryptographic primitives can help regulators handle complex tracing tasks among large amounts of user profiles (stored by the issuer) and authentication records (stored by the service provider), additional security primitives are still needed to ensure the privacy of other users. Besides, hardware-binding anonymous credential (hbAC) systems have been proposed to prevent credential sharing or address platform resource constraints, the traceability of hbAC has yet to be discussed.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce a public key encryption with equality test as a regulatory text for each authentication record to address the above-mentioned challenges. The security of this feature is guaranteed by the verifiability, non-frameability, and round isolation of the proposed scheme. We compared the asymptotic complexity of our scheme with other traceable AC schemes and shows our scheme has advantages in tracing tasks as well as securely outsourcing them. The key feature of our scheme is that the ability of equality test of regulatory texts is independent of the public key, but rather depends on the round identifier of the authentication. We instantiate a traceable, hardware-binding AC scheme based on smart cards and BBS+ signature and give the performance analysis of it.",

    "abstract": "Signature schemes from multi-round interactive proofs are becoming increasingly relevant in post-quantum cryptography. A prominent example is CROSS, recently admitted to the second round of the NIST on-ramp standardisation process for post-quantum digital signatures. While the security of these constructions relies on the Fiat-Shamir transform, in the case of CROSS the use of the fixed-weight parallel-repetition optimisation makes the security analysis fuzzier than usual. A recent work has shown that the fixed-weight parallel repetition of a multi-round interactive proof is still knowledge sound, but no matching result appears to be known for the non-interactive version.\r\nIn this paper we provide two main results. First, we explicitly prove the EUF-CMA security of CROSS, filling a gap in the literature. We do this by showing that, in general, the Fiat-Shamir transform of an HVZK and knowledge-sound multi-round interactive proof is EUF-CMA secure. Second, we present a novel forgery attack on signatures obtained from fixed-weight repetitions of 5-round interactive proofs, substantially improving upon a previous attack on parallel repetitions due to Kales and Zaverucha. Our new attack has particular relevance for CROSS, as it shows that several parameter sets achieve a significantly lower security level than claimed, with reductions up to 24% in the worst case.",

    "abstract": "We present the first complete asynchronous MPC protocols for the YOSO (You Speak Only Once) setting. Our protocols rely on threshold additively homomorphic Paillier encryption and are adaptively secure. We rely on the paradigm of Blum et al. (TCC `20) in order to recursively refresh the setup needed for running future steps of YOSO MPC, but replace any use of heavy primitives such as threshold fully homomorphic encryption in their protocol with more efficient alternatives. In order to obtain an efficient YOSO MPC protocol, we also revisit the consensus layer upon which our protocol is built. To this end, we present a novel total-order broadcast protocol with subquadratic communication complexity in the total number $M$ of parties in the network and whose complexity is optimal in the message length. This improves on recent work of Banghale et al. (ASIACRYPT `22) by giving a simplified and more efficient broadcast extension protocol for the asynchronous setting that avoids the use of cryptographic accumulators.",

    "abstract": "We construct the first polynomial commitment scheme (PCS) that has a transparent setup, quasi-linear prover time,  $\\log N$ verifier time, and $\\log \\log N$ proof size, for multilinear polynomials of size $N$. Concretely, we have the smallest proof size amongst transparent PCS, with proof size less than $4.5$KB for $N\\leq 2^{30}$. We prove that our scheme is secure entirely under falsifiable assumptions about groups of unknown order. The scheme significantly improves on the prior work of Dew (PKC 2023), which has super-cubic prover time and relies on the Generic Group Model (a non-falsifiable assumption). Along the way, we make several contributions that are of independent interest: PoKEMath, a protocol for efficiently proving that an arbitrary predicate over committed integer vectors holds; SIPA, a bulletproofs-style inner product argument in groups of unknown order; we also distill out what prior work required from the Generic Group Model and frame this as a falsifiable assumption.",

    "abstract": "The symmetric binary perceptron ($\\mathrm{SBP}_{\\kappa}$) problem with parameter $\\kappa : \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq1} \\to [0,1]$ is an average-case search problem defined as follows: given a random Gaussian matrix $\\mathbf{A} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)^{n \\times m}$ as input where $m \\geq n$, output a vector $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\{-1,1\\}^m$ such that $$|| \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x} ||_{\\infty} \\leq \\kappa(m/n) \\cdot \\sqrt{m}~.$$\r\nThe number partitioning problem ($\\mathrm{NPP}_{\\kappa}$) corresponds to the special case of setting $n=1$. There is considerable evidence that both problems exhibit large computational-statistical gaps.\r\n    \r\nIn this work, we show (nearly) tight average-case hardness for these problems, assuming the worst-case hardness of standard approximate shortest vector problems on lattices.\r\n\r\nFor $\\mathrm{SBP}_\\kappa$, statistically, solutions exist with $\\kappa(x) = 2^{-\\Theta(x)}$ (Aubin, Perkins and Zdeborova, Journal of Physics 2019). For large $n$, the best that efficient algorithms have been able to achieve is a far cry from the statistical bound, namely $\\kappa(x) = \\Theta(1/\\sqrt{x})$ (Bansal and Spencer, Random Structures and Algorithms 2020). The problem has been extensively studied in the TCS and statistics communities, and Gamarnik, Kizildag, Perkins and Xu (FOCS 2022) conjecture that Bansal-Spencer is tight: namely, $\\kappa(x) = \\widetilde{\\Theta}(1/\\sqrt{x})$ is the optimal value achieved by computationally efficient algorithms. \r\n        \r\nWe prove their conjecture assuming the worst-case hardness of approximating the shortest vector problem on lattices.\r\n\r\nFor $\\mathrm{NPP}_\\kappa$, statistically, solutions exist with $\\kappa(m) = \\Theta(2^{-m})$ (Karmarkar, Karp, Lueker and Odlyzko, Journal of Applied Probability 1986). Karmarkar and Karp's classical differencing algorithm achieves $\\kappa(m) = 2^{-O(\\log^2 m)}~.$\r\n        \r\nWe prove that Karmarkar-Karp is nearly tight: namely, no polynomial-time algorithm can achieve $\\kappa(m) = 2^{-\\Omega(\\log^3 m)}$, once again assuming the  worst-case subexponential hardness of approximating the shortest vector problem on lattices to within a subexponential factor.\r\n\r\nOur hardness results are versatile, and hold with respect to different distributions of the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ (e.g., i.i.d. uniform entries from $[0,1]$) and weaker requirements on the solution vector $\\mathbf{x}$.",

    "abstract": "Security models provide a way of formalising security properties in a rigorous way, but it is sometimes difficult to ensure that the model really fits the concept that we are trying to formalise. In this paper, we illustrate this fact by showing the discrepancies between the security model of anonymity of linkable ring signatures and the security that is actually expected for this kind of signature. These signatures allow a user to sign anonymously within an ad hoc group generated from the public keys of the group members, but all their signatures can be linked together. Reading the related literature, it seems obvious that users' identities must remain hidden even when their signatures are linked, but we show that, surprisingly, almost none have adopted a security model that guarantees it. We illustrate this by presenting two counter-examples which are secure in most anonymity model of linkable ring signatures, but which trivially leak a signer's identity after only two signatures.\r\n\r\n  A natural fix to this model, already introduced in some previous work, is proposed in a corruption model where the attacker can generate the keys of certain users themselves, which seems much more coherent in a context where the group of users can be constructed in an ad hoc way at the time of signing. We believe that these two changes make the security model more realistic. Indeed, within the framework of this model, our counter-examples becomes insecure. Furthermore, we show that most of the schemes in the literature we surveyed appear to have been designed to achieve the security guaranteed by the latest model, which reinforces the idea that the model is closer to the informal intuition of what anonymity should be in linkable ring signatures.",

    "abstract": "A private-information-retrieval (PIR) scheme lets a client fetch a record from a remote database without revealing which record it fetched. Classic PIR schemes treat all database records the same but, in practice, some database records are much more popular (i.e., commonly fetched) than others. We introduce distributional private information retrieval, a new type of PIR that can run faster than classic PIR\u2013both asymptotically and concretely\u2013when the popularity distribution is heavily skewed. Distributional PIR provides exactly the same cryptographic privacy as classic PIR. The speedup comes from a relaxed form of correctness: distributional PIR guarantees that in-distribution queries succeed with good probability, while out-of-distribution queries succeed with lower probability.\r\n\r\nWe construct a distributional-PIR scheme that makes black-box use of classic PIR protocols, and prove a lower bound on the server-runtime of a large class of distributional-PIR schemes. On two real-world popularity distributions, our distributional-PIR construction reduces compute costs by $5$-$77\\times$ compared to existing techniques. Finally, we build CrowdSurf, an end-to-end system for privately fetching tweets, and show that distributional-PIR reduces the end-to-end server cost by $8\\times$.",

    "abstract": "BFT protocols usually have a waterfall-like degradation in performance in the face of crash faults. Some BFT protocols may not experience sudden performance degradation under crash faults. They achieve this at the expense of increased communication and round complexity in fault-free scenarios. In a nutshell, existing protocols lack the adaptability needed to perform optimally under varying conditions.\r\n\r\nWe propose TockOwl, the first asynchronous consensus protocol with fault adaptability. TockOwl features quadratic communication and constant round complexity, allowing it to remain efficient in fault-free scenarios. TockOwl also possesses crash robustness, enabling it to maintain stable performance when facing crash faults. These properties collectively ensure the fault adaptability of TockOwl.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we propose TockOwl+ that has network adaptability. TockOwl+ incorporates both fast and slow tracks and employs hedging delays, allowing it to achieve low latency comparable to partially synchronous protocols without waiting for timeouts in asynchronous environments. Compared to the latest dual-track protocols, the slow track of TockOwl+ is simpler, implying shorter latency in fully asynchronous environments.",

    "abstract": "The problem of computing an isogeny of large prime degree from a supersingular elliptic curve of unknown endomorphism ring is assumed to be hard both for classical as well as quantum computers.\r\nIn this work, we first build a two-round identification protocol whose security reduces to this problem.  The challenge consists of a random large prime $q$ and the prover simply replies with an efficient representation of an isogeny of degree $q$ from its public key.\r\nUsing the hash-and-sign paradigm, we then derive a signature scheme with a very simple and flexible signing procedure and prove its security in the standard model.\r\nOur optimized C implementation of the signature scheme shows that signing is roughly $1.8\\times$ faster than all SQIsign variants, whereas verification is $1.4\\times$ times slower.  The sizes of the public key and signature are comparable to existing schemes.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the algorithmic problem of computing isomorphisms between products of supersingular elliptic curves, given their endomorphism rings. This computational problem seems to be difficult when the domain and codomain are fixed, whereas we provide efficient algorithms to compute isomorphisms when part of the codomain is built during the construction. We propose an authentication protocol whose security relies on this asymmetry. Its most prominent feature is that the endomorphism rings of the elliptic curves are not hidden. Furthermore, it does not require a trusted setup.",

It contains a novel modular multiplication design for modular multiplication with a constant for a constant modulus. This modular multiplication design does not require any DSP units or any dedicated multiplier unit, nor does it require extra logic whencompared to the state-of-the-art modular multipliers. Furthermore, we present an implementation of a constant multiplier Number Theoretic Transform design for TFHE-like schemes. Lastly, we use this Number Theoretic Transform design to implement a FINAL hardware accelerator for the AMD Alveo U55c which improves the Throughput metric of TFHE-like cryptosystems on FPGAs by a factor 9.28x over Li et al.'s NFP CHES 2024 accelerator and by 10-25% over the absolute state-of-the-art design FPT while using one third of FPTs DSPs.",

    "abstract": "In modern cryptography, relatively few instantiations of foundational cryptographic primitives are used across most cryptographic protocols. For example, elliptic curve groups are typically instantiated using P-256, P-384, Curve25519, or Curve448, while block ciphers are commonly instantiated with AES, and hash functions with SHA-2, SHA-3, or SHAKE. This limited diversity raises concerns that an adversary with nation-state-level resources could perform a preprocessing attack, generating a hint that might later be exploited to break protocols built on these primitives. It is often notoriously challenging to analyze and upper bound the advantage of a preprocessing attacker even if we assume that we have idealized instantiations of our cryptographic primitives (ideal permutations, ideal ciphers, random oracles, generic groups). Coretti et al. (CRYPTO/EUROCRYPT'18) demonstrated a powerful framework to simplify the analysis of preprocessing attacks, but they only proved that their framework applies when the cryptographic protocol uses a single idealized primitive. In practice, however, cryptographic constructions often utilize multiple different cryptographic primitives. \r\n\r\nWe verify that Coretti et al. (CRYPTO/EUROCRYPT'18)'s framework extends to settings with multiple idealized primitives and we apply this framework to analyze the multi-user security of (short) Schnorr Signatures and the CCA-security of PSEC-KEM against pre-processing attackers in the Random Oracle Model (ROM) plus the Generic Group Model (GGM). Prior work of Blocki and Lee (EUROCRYPT'22) used complicated compression arguments to analyze the security of {\\em key-prefixed} short Schnorr signatures where the random oracle is salted with the user's public key. However, the security analysis did not extend to standardized implementations of Schnorr Signatures (e.g., BSI-TR-03111 or ISO/IEC 14888-3) which do not adopt key-prefixing, but take other measures to protect against preprocessing attacks by disallowing signatures that use a preimage of $0$.  Blocki and Lee (EUROCRYPT'22) left the (in)security of such \"nonzero Schnorr Signature\" constructions as an open question. We fully resolve this open question demonstrating that (short) nonzero Schnorr Signatures are also secure against preprocessing attacks. We also analyze PSEC-KEM in the ROM+GGM demonstrating that this Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) is CPA-secure against preprocessing attacks.",

    "abstract": "The rise of 5G and IoT has shifted secure communication from centralized and homogeneous to a landscape of heterogeneous mobile devices constantly travelling between myriad networks. In such environments, it is desirable for devices to securely extend their connection from one network to another, often referred to as a handover. In this work we introduce the first cryptographic formalisation of secure handover schemes. We leverage our formalisation to propose path privacy, a novel security property for handovers that has hitherto remained unexplored. We further develop a syntax for secure handovers, and identify security properties appropriate for secure handover schemes. Finally, we introduce a generic handover scheme that captures all the strong notions of security we have identified, combining our novel path privacy concept with other security properties characteristic to existing handover schemes, demonstrating the robustness and versatility of our framework.",

    "abstract": "Everlasting (EL) privacy offers an attractive solution to the Store-Now-Decrypt-Later (SNDL) problem, where future increases in the attacker's capability could break systems which are believed to be secure today. Instead of requiring full information-theoretic security, everlasting privacy allows computationally-secure transmissions of ephemeral secrets, which are only \"effective\" for a limited periods of time, after which their compromise is provably useless for the SNDL attacker.\r\n\r\nIn this work we revisit such everlasting privacy model of Dodis and Yeo (ITC'21), which we call Hypervisor EverLasting Privacy (HELP). HELP is a novel architecture for generating shared randomness using a network of semi-trusted servers (or \"hypervisors\"), trading the need to store/distribute large shared secrets with the assumptions that it is hard to: (a) simultaneously compromise too many publicly accessible ad-hoc servers; and (b) break a computationally-secure encryption scheme very quickly. While Dodis and Yeo presented good HELP solutions in the asymptotic sense, their solutions were concretely expensive and used heavy tools (like large finite fields or gigantic Toeplitz matrices). \r\n\r\nWe abstract and generalize the HELP architecture to allow for more efficient instantiations, and construct several concretely efficient HELP solutions. Our solutions use elementary cryptographic operations, such as hashing and message authentication. We also prove a very strong composition theorem showing that our EL architecture can use any message transmission method which is computationally-secure in the Universal Composability (UC) framework. This is the first positive composition result for everlasting privacy, which was otherwise known to suffer from many \"non-composition\" results (M\u00fcller-Quade and Unruh; J of Cryptology'10).",

    "abstract": "Timed cryptography has initiated a paradigm shift in the design of cryptographic protocols: Using timed cryptography we can realize tasks fairly, which is provably out of range of standard cryptographic concepts. To a certain degree, the success of timed cryptography is rooted in the existence of efficient protocols based on the sequential squaring assumption.\r\n\r\n    In this work, we consider space analogues of timed cryptographic primitives, which we refer to as space-hard primitives. Roughly speaking, these notions require honest protocol parties to invest a certain amount of space and provide security against space constrained adversaries. While inefficient generic constructions of timed-primitives from strong assumptions such as indistinguishability obfuscation can be adapted to the space-hard setting, we currently lack concrete and versatile algebraically structured assumptions for space-hard cryptography.\r\n \r\n    In this work, we initiate the study of space-hard primitives from concrete algebraic assumptions relating to the problem of root-finding of sparse polynomials. Our motivation to study this problem is a candidate construction of VDFs by Boneh et al. (CRYPTO 2018) which are based on the hardness of inverting permutation polynomials. Somewhat anticlimactically, our first contribution is a full break of this candidate. However, we then revise this hardness assumption by dropping the permutation requirement and considering arbitrary sparse high degree polynomials. We argue that this type of assumption is much better suited for space-hardness rather than timed cryptography. We then proceed to construct both space-lock puzzles and verifiable space-hard functions from this assumption.",

    "abstract": "We present hax, a verification toolchain for Rust targeted at security-critical software such as cryptographic libraries, protocol imple- mentations, authentication and authorization mechanisms, and parsing and sanitization code. The key idea behind hax is the pragmatic observation that different verification tools are better at handling different kinds of verification goals. Consequently, hax supports multiple proof backends, including domain-specific security analysis tools like ProVerif and SSProve, as well as general proof assistants like Coq and F*. In this paper, we present the hax toolchain and show how we use it to translate Rust code to the input languages of different provers. We describe how we systematically test our translated models and our models of the Rust system libraries to gain confidence in their correctness. Finally, we briefly overview various ongoing verification projects that rely on hax.",

    "abstract": "We translate the expand-and-extract framework by Fitzi, Liu-Zhang, and Loss (PODC 21) to the asynchronous setting.\r\nWhile they use it to obtain a synchronous BA with $2^{-\\lambda}$ error probability in $\\lambda+1$ rounds, we make it work in asynchrony in $\\lambda+3$ rounds. At the heart of their solution is a generalization of crusader agreement and graded agreement to any number of grades called proxcensus. They achieve graded consensus with $2^r+1$ grades in $r$ rounds by reducing proxcensus with $2s-1$ grades to proxcensus with $s$ grades in one round. The expand-and-extract paradigm uses proxcensus to expand binary inputs to $2^\\lambda+1$ grades in $\\lambda$ rounds before extracting a binary output by partitioning the grades using a $\\lambda$ bit common coin. However, the proxcensus protocol by Fitzi et al. does not translate to the asynchronous setting without lowering the corruption threshold or using more rounds in each recursive step.\r\n\r\nThis is resolved by attaching justifiers to all messages: forcing the adversary to choose between being ignored by the honest parties, or sending messages with certain validity properties. Using these we define validated proxcensus and show that it can be instantiated in asynchrony with the same recursive structure and round complexity as synchronous proxcensus. In asynchrony the extraction phase incurs a security loss of one bit which is recovered by expanding to twice as many grades using an extra round of communication. This results in a $\\lambda+2$ round VABA and a $\\lambda+3$ round BA, both with $2^{-\\lambda}$ error probability and communication complexity matching Fitzi et al.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation schemes are powerful primitives that enable distributed and incremental verifiable computation with less overhead than recursive SNARKs. However, existing schemes with constant-size accumulation verifiers, suffer from linear-sized accumulators and deciders, leading to linear-sized proofs that are unsuitable in distributed settings. Motivated by the need for bandwidth efficient accountable voting protocols, (I) We introduce KZH, a novel polynomial commitment scheme, and (II) KZH-fold, the first sublinear accumulation scheme where the verifier only does $3$ group scalar multiplications and $O(n^{1/2})$ accumulator size and decider time. Our scheme generalizes to achieve accumulator and decider complexity of $k \\cdot n^{1/k}$ with verifier complexity $k$. Using the BCLMS compiler, (III) we build an IVC/PCD scheme with sublinear proof and decider. (IV) Next, we propose a new approach to non-uniform IVC, where the cost of proving a step is proportional only to the size of the step instruction circuit, and unlike previous approaches, the witness size is not linear in the number of instructions. (V) Leveraging these advancements, we demonstrate the power of KZH-fold by implementing an accountable voting scheme using a novel signature aggregation protocol supporting millions of participants, significantly reducing communication overhead and verifier time compared to BLS-based aggregation. We implemented and benchmarked our protocols and KZH-fold achieves a 2000x reduction in communication and a 50x improvement in decider time over Nova when proving 2000 Poseidon hashes, at the cost of 3x the prover time.",

    "abstract": "Overclocking is a a supported functionality of Nvidia GPUs, and is a common performance enhancement practice. However, overclocking poses a danger for cryptographic applications. As the temperature in the overclocked GPU increases, spurious computation faults occur. Coupled with well known fault attacks against RSA implementations, one can expect such faults to allow compromising RSA private keys during decryption or signing. \r\n\r\nWe first validate this hypothesis: We evaluate two commercial-grade GPU-based implementations of RSA within openSSL (called RNS and MP), under a wide range of overclocking levels and temperatures, and demonstrate that both implementations are vulnerable.\r\n\r\nHowever, and more importantly, we show for the first time that even if the GPU is benignly overclocked to a seemingly ``safe'' rate, a successful attack can still be mounted, over the network, by simply sending requests at an aggressive rate to increase the temperature. Hence, setting any level of overclocking on the GPU is risky.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we observe a huge difference in the implementations'\r\nvulnerability: the rate of RSA breaks for RNS is 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of MP. We attribute this difference to the implementations' memory usage patterns: RNS makes heavy use of the GPU's global memory, which is accessed via both the Unified (L1) cache and the L2 cache; MP primarily uses ``shared'' on-chip memory, which is local to each GPU Streaming MultiProcessor (SM) and is uncached,  utilizing the memory banks used for the L1 cache. We believe that the computation faults are caused by reads from the global memory, which under a combination of overclocking, high temperature and high memory contention, occasionally return stale values.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel single-trace side-channel attack on FALCON---a lattice-based post-quantum digital signature protocol recently approved for standardization by NIST. We target the discrete Gaussian sampling operation within the FALCON key generation scheme and use a single power measurement trace to succeed. Notably, negating the 'shift right 63-bit' operation (for 64-bit values) leaks critical information about the '-1' vs. '0' assignments to intermediate coefficients. These leaks enable full recovery of the generated secret keys. The proposed attack is implemented on an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller running both reference and optimized software implementation from FALCON's NIST Round 3 package. \r\n Statistical analysis with 500k tests reveals a per coefficient success rate of 99.9999999478% and a full key recovery success rate of 99.99994654% for FALCON-512. This work highlights the vulnerability of current software solutions to single-trace attacks and underscores the urgent need to develop single-trace resilient software for embedded systems.",

    "abstract": "We develop an efficient algorithm to detect whether a superspecial genus 2 Jacobian is optimally $(N, N)$-split for each integer $N \\leq 11$. Incorporating this algorithm into the best-known attack against the superspecial isogeny problem in dimension 2 (due to Costello and Smith) gives rise to significant cryptanalytic improvements. Our implementation shows that when the underlying prime $p$ is 100 bits, the attack is sped up by a factor of $25$; when the underlying prime is 200 bits, the attack is sped up by a factor of $42$; and, when the underlying prime is 1000 bits, the attack is sped up by a factor of $160$. Furthermore, we describe a more general algorithm to find endomorphisms of superspecial genus 2 Jacobians.",

    "abstract": "OPC UA is a standardized Industrial Control System (ICS) protocol, deployed in critical infrastructures, that aims to ensure security. The forthcoming version 1.05 includes major changes in the underlying cryptographic design, including a Diffie-Hellmann based key exchange, as opposed to the previous RSA based version. Version 1.05 is supposed to offer stronger security, including Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS). \r\n\r\nWe perform a formal security analysis of the security protocols specified in OPC UA v1.05 and v1.04, for the RSA-based and the new DH-based mode, using the state-of-the-art symbolic protocol verifier ProVerif. Compared to previous studies, our model is much more comprehensive, including the new protocol version, combination of the different sub-protocols for establishing secure channels, sessions and their management, covering a large range of possible configurations. This results in one of the largest models ever studied in ProVerif raising many challenges related to its verification mainly due to the complexity of the state machine. We discuss how we mitigated this complexity to obtain meaningful analysis results. Our analysis uncovered several new vulnerabilities, that have been reported to and acknowledged by the OPC Foundation. We designed and proposed provably secure fixes, most of which are included in the upcoming version of the standard.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study practical constructions of asynchronous distributed key reconfiguration ($\\mathsf{ADKR}$), which enables an asynchronous fault-tolerant system with an existing threshold cryptosystem to efficiently generate a new threshold cryptosystem for a reconfigured set of participants. While existing asynchronous distributed threshold key generation ($\\mathsf{ADKG}$) protocols theoretically solve $\\mathsf{ADKR}$, they fail to deliver satisfactory scalability due to cubic communication overhead, even with simplifications to the reconfiguration setting.\r\n\r\nWe introduce a more efficient \\textit{share-dispersal-then-agree-and-recast} paradigm for constructing $\\mathsf{ADKR}$ with preserving adaptive security. The method replaces expensive $O(n)$ asynchronous verifiable secret sharing   protocols in   classic $\\mathsf{ADKG}$ with $O(n)$ cheaper dispersals of publicly-verifiable sharing transcripts;  after consensus confirms a set of finished dispersals, it selects a small $\\kappa$-subset of finished dispersals for verification, reducing the total overhead to $O(\\kappa n^2)$ from $O(n^3)$, where $\\kappa$ is a small constant (typically $\\sim$30 or less). To further optimize concrete efficiency, we propose an interactive protocol with linear communication to generate publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) transcripts, avoiding computationally expensive non-interactive PVSS. Additionally, we introduce a distributed PVSS verification mechanism, minimizing redundant computations across different parties and reducing the dominating PVSS verification cost by about one-third.\r\n\r\nOur design also enables diverse applications: (i) given a quadratic-communication asynchronous coin-flipping protocol, it implies the first quadratic-communication $\\mathsf{ADKG}$; and (ii) it can   be extended to realize the first quadratic-communication asynchronous dynamic proactive secret sharing (ADPSS) protocol with adaptive security. Experimental evaluations on a global network of 256 AWS servers show up to 40\\% lower latency compared to state-of-the-art $\\mathsf{ADKG}$ protocols (with simplifications to the reconfiguration setting), highlighting the practicality of our $\\mathsf{ADKR}$ in large-scale asynchronous systems.",

    "abstract": "We give a sieving algorithm for finding pairs of primes with small multiplicative orders modulo each other. This problem is a necessary condition for obtaining constructions of $2$-cycles of pairing-friendly curves, which have found use in cryptographic applications. Our database of examples suggests that, with the exception of a well-known infinite family of such primes, instances become increasingly rare as the size of the primes increase. This leads to some interesting open questions for which we hope our database prompts further investigation.",

    "abstract": "We propose a quantum function secret sharing scheme in which the communication is exclusively classical. In this primitive, a classical dealer distributes a secret quantum circuit $C$ by providing shares to  $p$ quantum parties. The parties on an input state $\\ket{\\psi}$ and a projection $\\Pi$, compute values $y_i$ that they then classically communicate back to the dealer, who can then compute $\\lVert\\Pi C\\ket{\\psi}\\rVert^2$ using only classical resources. Moreover,  the shares do not leak much information about the secret circuit $C$.\r\nOur protocol for quantum secret sharing uses the Cayley path, a tool that has been extensively used to support quantum primacy claims. More concretely, the shares of $C$ correspond to randomized version of $C$ which are delegated to the quantum parties, and the reconstruction can be done by extrapolation. Our scheme has two limitations, which we prove to be inherent to our techniques: First, our scheme is only secure against single adversaries, and we show that if two parties collude, then they can break its security. Second, the evaluation done by the parties requires exponential time in the number of gates.",

    "abstract": "We propose the first $\\textit{distributed}$ version of a simple, efficient, and provably quantum-safe pseudorandom function (PRF). The distributed PRF (DPRF) supports arbitrary threshold access structures based on the hardness of the well-studied Learning with Rounding (LWR) problem. Our construction (abbreviated as $\\mathsf{PQDPRF}$) practically outperforms not only existing constructions of DPRF based on lattice-based assumptions, but also outperforms (in terms of evaluation time) existing constructions of: (i) classically secure DPRFs based on discrete-log hard groups, and (ii) quantum-safe DPRFs based on any generic quantum-safe PRF (e.g. AES). The efficiency of $\\mathsf{PQDPRF}$ stems from the extreme simplicity of its construction, consisting of a simple inner product computation over $\\mathbb{Z}_q$, followed by a rounding to a smaller modulus $p < q$. The key technical novelty of our proposal lies in our proof technique, where we prove the correctness and post-quantum security of $\\mathsf{PQDPRF}$ (against semi-honest corruptions of any less than threshold number of parties) for a polynomial $q/p$ (equivalently, \"modulus to modulus\")-ratio. \r\n\r\nOur proposed DPRF construction immediately enables efficient yet quantum-safe instantiations of several practical applications, including key distribution centers, distributed coin tossing, long-term encryption of information, etc. We showcase a particular application of $\\mathsf{PQDPRF}$ in realizing an efficient yet quantum-safe version of distributed symmetric-key encryption ($\\mathsf{DiSE}$ -- originally proposed by Agrawal et al. in CCS 2018), which we call $\\mathsf{PQ-DiSE}$. For semi-honest adversarial corruptions across a wide variety of corruption thresholds, $\\mathsf{PQ-DiSE}$ substantially outperforms existing instantiations of $\\mathsf{DiSE}$ based on discrete-log hard groups and generic PRFs (e.g. AES). We illustrate the practical efficiency of our $\\mathsf{PQDPRF}$ via prototype implementation of $\\mathsf{PQ-DiSE}$.",

    "abstract": "Quasi-cyclic moderate-density parity check (QC-MDPC) code-based encryption schemes under iterative decoders offer highly-competitive performance in the quantum-resistant space of cryptography, but the decoding-failure rate (DFR) of these algorithms are not well-understood. The DFR decreases extremely rapidly as the ratio of code-length to error-bits increases, then decreases much more slowly in regimes known as the waterfall and error-floor, respectively.\r\n\r\nThis work establishes three, successively more detailed probabilistic models of the DFR for iterative decoders for QC-MPDC codes: the simplified model, the refined model for perfect keys, and the refined model for all keys. The models are built upon a Markov model introduced by Sendrier and Vasseur that closely predicts decoding behavior in the waterfall region but does not capture the error floor behavior. The simplified model introduces a modification which captures the dominant contributor to error floor behavior which is convergence to near codewords introduced by Vasseur in his PhD thesis. The refined models give more accurate predictions taking into account certain structural features of specific keys.\r\n\r\nOur models are based on the step-by-step decoder, which is highly simplified and experimentally displays worse decoding performance than parallel decoders used in practice.  Despite the use of the simplified decoder, we obtain an accurate prediction of the DFR in the error floor and demonstrate that the error floor behavior is dominated by convergence to a near codeword during a failed decoding instance.  Furthermore, we have run this model for a simplified version of the QC-MDPC code-based cryptosystem BIKE to better ascertain whether the DFR is low enough to achieve IND-CCA2 security.  Our model for a modified version of BIKE 1 gives a DFR which is below $2^{-129.5}$, using a block length $r = 13477$ instead of the BIKE 1 parameter $r = 12323$.",

    "abstract": "As cryptographic protocols transition to post-quantum security, most adopt hybrid solutions combining pre-quantum and post-quantum assumptions. However, this shift often introduces trade-offs in terms of efficiency, compactness, and in some cases, even security. One such example is deniability, which enables users, such as journalists or activists, to deny authorship of potentially incriminating messages. While deniability was once mainly of theoretical interest, protocols like X3DH, used in Signal and WhatsApp, provide it to billions of users. Recent work (Collins et al., PETS'25) has further bridged the gap between theory and real-world applicability. In the post-quantum setting, however, protocols like PQXDH, as well as others such as Apple\u2019s iMessage with PQ3, do not support deniability. This work investigates how to preserve deniability in the post-quantum setting by leveraging unconditional (statistical) guarantees instead of computational assumptions - distinguishing deniability from confidentiality and authenticity.\r\n\r\nAs a case study, we present a hybrid authenticated key encapsulation mechanism (AKEM) that provides statistical deniability, while maintaining authenticity and confidentiality through a combination of pre-quantum and post-quantum assumptions. To this end, we introduce two combiners at different levels of abstraction. First, at the highest level, we propose a black-box construction that combines two AKEMs, showing that deniability is preserved only when both constituent schemes are deniable. Second, we present Shadowfax, a non-black-box combiner that integrates a pre-quantum NIKE, a post-quantum KEM, and a post-quantum ring signature. We demonstrate that Shadowfax ensures deniability in both dishonest and honest receiver settings. When instantiated, we rely on statistical security for the former, and on a pre- or post-quantum assumption in the latter. Finally, we provide an optimised, yet portable, implementation of a specific instantiation of Shadowfax yielding ciphertexts of 1781 bytes and public keys of 1449 bytes. Our implementation achieves competitive performance: encapsulation takes 1.9 million cycles and decapsulation takes 800000 cycles on an Apple M1 Pro.",

    "abstract": "Supersingular elliptic curve isogeny graphs underlie isogeny-based cryptography. For isogenies of a single prime degree $\\ell$, their structure has been investigated graph-theoretically.\r\nWe generalise the notion of $\\ell$-isogeny graphs to $L$-isogeny graphs (studied in the prime field case by Delfs and Galbraith), where $L$ is a set of small primes dictating the allowed isogeny degrees in the graph. We analyse the graph-theoretic structure of $L$-isogeny graphs. Our approaches may be put into two categories: cycles and graph cuts. \r\n\r\nOn the topic of cycles, we provide: a count for the number of non-backtracking cycles in the $L$-isogeny graph using traces of Brandt matrices; an efficiently computable estimate based on this approach; and a third ideal-theoretic count for a certain subclass of $L$-isogeny cycles. We provide code to compute each of these three counts.   \r\n\r\nOn the topic of graph cuts, we compare several algorithms to compute graph cuts which minimise a measure called the edge expansion, outlining a cryptographic motivation for doing so. Our results show that a greedy neighbour algorithm out-performs standard spectral algorithms for computing optimal graph cuts. We provide code and study explicit examples. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, we describe several directions of active and future research.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to verifiable vote tallying using additive  homomorphism, which can be appended to existing voting systems without modifying the underlying infrastructure.  Existing End-to-End Verifiable (E2E-V) systems like Belenios and ElectionGuard rely on distributed trust models or are vulnerable to decryption compromises, making them less suitable for general elections. Our approach introduces a tamper-evident commitment to votes through cryptographic hashes derived from homomorphic encryption schemes such as Paillier. The proposed system provides tallied-as-cast verifiability without revealing individual votes, thereby preventing coercion. The system also provides the ability to perform public verification of results. We also show that this system can be transitioned to quantum-secure encryption like Regev for future-proofing the system.  We discuss how to deploy this system in a real-world scenario, including for general political elections, analyzing the security implications and report on the limitations of this system. We believe that the proposed system offers a practical solution to the problem of verifiable vote tallying in general elections.",

    "abstract": "Physical side-channel analysis (SCA) operates on the foundational assumption of access to known plaintext or ciphertext. However, this assumption can be easily invalidated in various scenarios, ranging from common encryption modes like Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) to complex hardware implementations, where such data may be inaccessible. Blind SCA addresses this challenge by operating without the knowledge of plaintext or ciphertext. Unfortunately, prior such approaches have shown limited success in practical settings.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce the Deep Learning-based Blind Side-channel Analysis (DL-BSCA) framework, which leverages deep neural networks to recover secret keys in blind SCA settings. In addition, we propose a novel labeling method, Multi-point Cluster-based (MC) labeling, accounting for dependencies between leakage variables by exploiting multiple sample points for each variable, improving the accuracy of trace labeling. \r\nWe validate our approach across four datasets, including symmetric key algorithms (AES and Ascon) and a post-quantum cryptography algorithm, Kyber, with platforms ranging from high-leakage 8-bit AVR XMEGA to noisy 32-bit ARM STM32F4. Notably, previous methods failed to recover the key on the same datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the first successful blind SCA on a desynchronization countermeasure enabled by DL-BSCA and MC labeling. All experiments are validated with real-world SCA measurements, highlighting the practicality and effectiveness of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Impossible differential (ID) cryptanalysis and impossible boomerang (IB) cryptanalysis are two methods of impossible cryptanalysis against block ciphers. Since the seminal work introduced by Boura et al. in 2014, there have been no substantial advancements in the key recovery process for impossible cryptanalysis, particularly for the IB attack.In this paper, we propose a generic key recovery framework for impossible cryptanalysis that supports arbitrary key-guessing strategies, enabling optimal key recovery attacks. Within the framework, we provide a formal analysis of probabilistic extensions in impossible cryptanalysis for the first time. Besides, for the construction of IB distinguishers, we propose a new method for finding contradictions in multiple rounds.\r\n\r\nBy incorporating these techniques, we propose an Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)-based tool for finding full ID and IB attacks. To demonstrate the power of our methods, we applied it to several block ciphers, including SKINNY, SKINNYee, Midori, and Deoxys-BC. Our approach yields a series of optimal results in impossible cryptanalysis, achieving significant improvements in time and memory complexities. Notably, our IB attack on SKINNYee is the first 30-round attack.",

    "abstract": "In 2011, Lu introduced the impossible boomerang attack at DCC. This powerful cryptanalysis technique combines the strengths of the impossible differential and boomerang attacks, thereby inheriting the advantages of both cryptographic techniques. In this paper, we propose a holistic framework comprising two generic and effective algorithms and a MILP-based model to search for the optimal impossible boomerang attack systematically. The first algorithm incorporates any key guessing strategy, while the second integrates the meet-in-the-middle (MITM) attack into the key recovery process. Our framework is highly flexible, accommodating any set of attack parameters and returning the optimal attack complexity. When applying our framework to Deoxys-BC-256, Deoxys-BC-384, Joltik-BC-128, Joltik-BC-192, and SKINNYe v2, we achieve several significant improvements. We achieve the first 11-round impossible boomerang attacks on Deoxys-BC-256\\ and Joltik-BC-128. For SKINNYe v2, we achieve the first 33-round impossible boomerang attack, then using the MITM approach in the key recovery attack, the time complexity is significantly reduced. Additionally, for the 14-round Deoxys-BC-384 and Joltik-BC-192, the time complexity of the impossible boomerang attack is reduced by factors exceeding 2^{27} and 2^{12}, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The nonlinear filter model is an old and well understood approach to the design of secure stream ciphers. Extensive research over several decades has shown how to attack stream ciphers based on this model and has identified the security properties required of the Boolean function used as the filtering function to resist such attacks. This led to the problem of constructing Boolean functions which provide adequate security and at the same time are efficient to implement. Unfortunately, over the last two decades no good solutions to this problem appeared in the literature. The lack of good solutions has effectively led to nonlinear filter model becoming more or less obsolete. This is a big loss to the cryptographic design toolkit, since the great advantages of the nonlinear filter model are its simplicity, well understood security and the potential to provide low cost solutions for hardware oriented stream ciphers. In this paper we construct balanced functions on an odd number $n\\geq 5$ of variables with the following provable properties: linear bias equal to $2^{-\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor -1}$, algebraic degree equal to $2^{\\lfloor \\log_2\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor \\rfloor}$, algebraic immunity at least $\\lceil (n-1)/4\\rceil$, fast algebraic immunity at least $1+\\lceil (n-1)/4\\rceil $, and can be implemented using $O(n)$ NAND gates. The functions are obtained from a simple modification of the well known class of Maiorana-McFarland bent functions. By appropriately choosing $n$ and the length $L$ of the linear feedback shift register, we show that it is possible to obtain examples of stream ciphers which are $\\kappa$-bit secure against known types of attacks for various values of $\\kappa$. We provide concrete proposals for $\\kappa=80,128,160,192,224$ and $256$. For the $80$-bit, $128$-bit, and the $256$-bit security levels, the circuits for the corresponding stream ciphers require about 1743.5, 2771.5, and 5607.5 NAND gates respectively. For the $80$-bit and the $128$-bit security levels, the gate count estimates compare quite well to the famous ciphers Trivium and Grain-128a respectively, while for the $256$-bit security level, we do not know of any other stream cipher design which has such a low gate count.",

    "abstract": "Anonymous Attribute-Based Credentials (ABCs) allow users to prove possession of attributes while adhering to various authentication policies and without revealing unnecessary information. Single-use ABCs are particularly appealing for their lightweight nature and practical efficiency. These credentials are typically built using blind signatures, with Anonymous Credentials Light (ACL) being one of the most prominent schemes in the literature. However, the security properties of single-use ABCs, especially their secure showing property, have not been fully explored, and prior definitions and corresponding security proofs fail to address scenarios involving partial attribute disclosure effectively. In this work, we propose a stronger secure showing definition that ensures robust security even under selective attribute revelation. Our definition extends the winning condition of the existing secure showing experiment by adding various constraints on the subsets of opened attributes. We show how to represent this winning condition as a matching problem in a suitable bipartite graph, thus allowing for it to be verified efficiently. We then prove that ACL satisfies our strong secure showing notion without any modification. Finally, we define double-spending prevention for single-use ABCs, and show how ACL satisfies the definition.",

We consider an adversary that is a participating party of PJC and describe four practical attacks that break the other party's input privacy, and which are able to recover both membership of keys in the intersection and their associated values.  Our attacks consider the privacy threats associated with deployment and highlight the need to include the functionality output as part of the MPC security model.",

    "abstract": "The GINX method in TFHE offers low-latency ciphertext bootstrapping with relatively small bootstrapping keys, but is limited to binary or ternary key distributions. In contrast, the AP method supports arbitrary key distributions, however at the cost of significantly large bootstrapping keys. Building on AP, automorphism-based methods (LMK\u207a, EUROCRYPT 2023) achieve smaller keys, though each automorphism application necessitates a key switch, introducing computational overhead and noise.\r\nThis paper advances automorphism-based methods in two important ways. First, it proposes a novel traversal blind rotation algorithm that optimizes the number of key switches for a given key material. Second, it introduces an automorphism-parametrized external product that seamlessly applies an automorphism to one of the input ciphertexts. Together, these techniques substantially reduce the number of key switches, resulting in faster bootstrapping and improved noise control.  As an independent contribution, this paper also introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing the expected number of automorphism key switches, whose predictions perfectly align with the results of extensive numerical experiments, demonstrating its practical relevance.\r\nIn a typical setting, by utilizing additional key material, the LLW\u207a approach (TCHES 2024) reduces key switches by 17% compared to LMK\u207a. Our combined techniques achieve a 46% reduction using similar key material and can eliminate an arbitrary large number (e.g., > 99%) of key switches  with only a moderate (9x) increase in key material size.",

Over the last several decades, we have seen tremendous advances in new designs and constructions for $\\mathsf{FE}$ supporting different function classes, from a variety of assumptions and with varying levels of security. Unfortunately, the same has not been replicated in the multi-authority setting. The current scope of $\\mathsf{MA}$-$\\mathsf{FE}$ designs is rather limited, with positive results only known for (all-or-nothing) attribute-based functionalities, or need full power of general-purpose code obfuscation. This state-of-the-art in $\\mathsf{MA}$-$\\mathsf{FE}$ could be explained in part by the implication provided by Brakerski et al. (ITCS'17). It was shown that a general-purpose obfuscation scheme can be designed from any $\\mathsf{MA}$-$\\mathsf{FE}$ scheme for circuits, even if the $\\mathsf{MA}$-$\\mathsf{FE}$ scheme is secure only in a bounded-collusion model, where at most two keys per authority get corrupted.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we revisit the problem of $\\mathsf{MA}$-$\\mathsf{FE}$, and show that existing implication from $\\mathsf{MA}$-$\\mathsf{FE}$ to obfuscation is not tight. We provide new methods to design $\\mathsf{MA}$-$\\mathsf{FE}$ for circuits from simple and minimal cryptographic assumptions. Our main contributions are summarized below\r\n\r\n  1. We design a $\\mathsf{poly}(\\lambda)$-authority $\\mathsf{MA}$-$\\mathsf{FE}$ for circuits in the bounded-collusion model. Under the existence of public-key encryption, we prove it to be statically simulation-secure. Further, if we assume sub-exponential security of public-key encryption, then we prove it to be adaptively simulation-secure in the Random Oracle Model.\r\n  2. We design a $O(1)$-authority $\\mathsf{MA}$-$\\mathsf{FE}$ for circuits in the bounded-collusion model. Under the existence of 2/3-party non-interactive key exchange, we prove it to be adaptively simulation-secure.\r\n  3. We provide a new generic bootstrapping compiler for $\\mathsf{MA}$-$\\mathsf{FE}$ for general circuits to design a simulation-secure $(n_1 + n_2)$-authority $\\mathsf{MA}$-$\\mathsf{FE}$ from any two $n_1$-authority and $n_2$-authority $\\mathsf{MA}$-$\\mathsf{FE}$.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we revisit shuffle protocol for Shamir secret sharing. Upon examining previous works, we observe that existing constructions either produce non-uniform shuffle or require large communication and round complexity, e.g. exponential in the number of parties. We propose two shuffle protocols, both of which shuffle uniformly within $O(\\frac{k + l}{\\log k}n^2m\\log m)$ communication for shuffling rows of an $m\\times l$ matrix shared among $n$ parties, where $k\\leq m$ is a parameter balancing communication and computation. Our first construction is more concretely efficient, while our second construction requires only $O(nml)$ online communication within $O(n)$ round. In terms of overall communication and online communication, both shuffle protocols outperform current optimal shuffle protocols for Shamir secret sharing.\r\n        \r\nAt the core of our constructions is a novel permutation-sharing technique, which can be used to permute arbitrarily many vectors by computing matrix-vector products. Once shared, applying a permutation becomes much cheaper, which results in a faster online phase. Letting each party share one secret uniform permutation in the offline phase and applying them sequentially in the online phase, we obtain our first shuffle protocol. To further optimize online complexity and simplify the trade-off, we adopt the shuffle correlation proposed by Gao et al. and obtain the second shuffle protocol with $O(nml)$ online communication and $O(n^2ml)$ online computation. This brings an additional benefit that the online complexity is now independent of offline complexity, which reduces parameter optimization to optimizing offline efficiency.\r\n\r\nOur constructions require only most basic primitives in Shamir secret sharing scheme, and work for arbitrary field $\\mathbb{F}$ of size larger than $n$. As shuffle is a frequent operation in algorithm design, we expect them to accelerate many other primitives in context of Shamir secret sharing MPC, such as sorting, oblivious data structure, etc.",

    "abstract": "The computation of the inverse of a polynomial over a quotient ring or a finite field plays a very important role during the key generation of post-quantum cryptosystems like NTRU, BIKE, and LEDACrypt. It is therefore important that there exist an efficient algorithm capable of running in constant time, to prevent timing side-channel attacks. In this article, we study both constant-time algorithms based on Fermat's Little Theorem and the Extended $GCD$ Algorithm, and provide a detailed comparison in terms of performance. According to our conclusion, we see that the constant-time Extended $GCD$-based Bernstein-Yang's algorithm shows a better performance with 1.76x-3.76x on \\texttt{x86} platforms compared to FLT-based methods. Although we report numbers from a software implementation, we additionally provide a short glimpse of some recent results when these two algorithms are implemented on various hardware platforms. Finally, we also explore other exponentiation algorithms that work similarly to the Itoh-Tsuji inversion method. These algorithms perform fewer polynomial multiplications and show a better performance with 1.56x-1.96x on \\texttt{x86} platform compared to Itoh-Tsuji inversion method.",

    "abstract": "Recent server-side optimizations like speculative decoding significantly enhance the interactivity and resource efficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) services. However, we show that these optimizations inadvertently introduce new side-channel vulnerabilities through network packet timing and size variations that tend to be input-dependent. Network adversaries can leverage these side channels to learn sensitive information contained in \\emph{encrypted} user prompts to and responses from public LLM services.  \r\n\r\nThis paper formalizes the security implications using a novel indistinguishability framework and introduces a novel attack that establishes the insecurity of real-world LLM services with streaming APIs under our security framework.\r\n\r\nOur proposed attack effectively deconstructs encrypted network packet traces to reveal the sizes of underlying LLM-generated tokens and whether the tokens were generated with or without certain server-side optimizations. Our attack can accurately predict private attributes in real-world privacy-sensitive LLM applications in medicine and finance with $71$--$92\\%$ accuracy on an open-source vLLM service and $50$--$90\\%$ accuracy on the commercial ChatGPT service. Finally, we show that solutions that hide these side channels to different degrees expose a tradeoff between security and performance --- specifically, interactivity and network bandwidth overheads.",

    "abstract": "A secret sharing scheme is a cryptographic primitive that allows a dealer to share a secret among a set of parties, so that only authorized subsets of them can recover it. The access structure of the scheme is the family of authorized subsets. In a weighted threshold secret sharing scheme, each party is assigned a weight according to its importance, and the authorized subsets are those in which the sum of their weights is at least the threshold value. \r\n\r\nFor these access structures, the best general constructions were presented by Beimel and Weinreb [IPL 2006]: The scheme with perfect security has share size $n^{O(\\log n)}$, while the scheme with computational security has share size polynomial in $n$. However, these constructions require the use of shallow monotone sorting networks, which limits their practical use.\r\n\r\nIn this context, we revisit this work and provide variants of these constructions that are feasible in practice. This is done by considering alternative circuits and formulas for weighted threshold functions that do not require monotone sorting networks. We show that, under the assumption that subexponentially secure one-way functions exist, any WTAS over $n$ parties and threshold $\\sigma$ admits a computational secret sharing scheme where the size of the shares is $\\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ and the size of the public information is $O(n^2\\log n\\log \\sigma)$. Moreover, we show that any authorized subset only needs to download $O(n\\log n\\log \\sigma)$ bits of public information to recover the secret.",

    "abstract": "Correlated randomness lies at the core of efficient modern secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocols. Costs of generating such correlated randomness required for the MPC online phase protocol often constitute a bottleneck in the overall protocol. \r\nA recent paradigm of {\\em pseudorandom correlation generator} (PCG) initiated by Boyle et al. (CCS'18, Crypto'19) offers an appealing solution to this issue. In sketch, each party is given a short PCG seed, which can be locally expanded into long correlated strings, satisfying the target correlation. Among various types of correlations, there is oblivious linear evaluation (OLE), a fundamental and useful primitive for typical MPC protocols on arithmetic circuits. \r\nTowards efficient generating a great amount of OLE, and applications to MPC protocols, we establish the following results:\r\n\r\n(i) We propose a novel {\\em programmable} PCG construction for OLE over any field $\\mathbb{F}_p$.  For $kN$ OLE correlations, we require $O(k\\log{N})$ communication and $O(k^2N\\log{N})$ computation, where $k$ is an arbitrary integer $\\geq 2$. Previous works either have quadratic computation (Boyle et al. Crypto'19), or can only support fields of size larger than $2$ (Bombar et al. Crypto'23).\r\n\r\n(ii) We extend the above OLE construction to provide various types of correlations for any finite field. One of the fascinating applications is an efficient PCG for two-party {\\em authenticated Boolean multiplication triples}. For $kN$ authenticated triples, we offer PCGs with seed size of $O(k^2\\log{N})$ bits. To our best knowledge, such correlation has not been realized with sublinear communication and quasi-linear computation ever before. \r\n\r\n(iii) In addition, the \\emph{programmability} admits efficient PCGs for multi-party Boolean triples, and thus the first efficient MPC protocol for Boolean circuits with {\\em silent} preprocessing. In particular, we show $kN$ $m$-party Boolean multiplication triples can be generated in $O(m^2k\\log{N})$-bit communication, while the state-of-the-art FOLEAGE (Asiacrypt'24) requires a broadcast channel and takes $mkN+O(m^2\\log{kN})$ bits communication.\r\n\r\n(iv) Finally, we present efficient PCGs for circuit-dependent preprocessing, matrix multiplications triples, and string OTs etc. Compared to previous works, each has its own right.",

    "abstract": "The Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is a crucial component in many post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms, enabling efficient polynomial multiplication. However, the reliability of NTT computations is an important concern, especially for safety-critical applications. This work presents novel techniques to improve the fault tolerance of NTTs used in prominent PQC schemes such as Kyber, Dilithium, and Falcon. The work first establishes a theoretical framework for error detection in NTTs, exploiting the inherent algebraic properties of these transforms. It derives necessary and sufficient conditions for constructing error-detecting vectors that can identify single faults without the need for costly recomputation. For the Dilithium scheme, the work further advances the state-of-the-art by developing the first algorithm capable of detecting up to two maliciously placed faults. The proposed error detection methods are shown to reduce the number of required multiplications by half, leading to significant improvements in computational efficiency compared to existing single error-detecting algorithms. Concrete implementations for Kyber, Dilithium, and Falcon demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the error-detection scheme.",

    "abstract": "In white-box cryptography, early encoding-based countermeasures have been broken by the DCA attack, leading to the utilization of masking schemes against a surge of automated attacks. The recent filtering attack from CHES 2024 broke the last viable masking scheme from CHES 2021 resisting both computational and algebraic attacks, raising the need for new countermeasures.\r\n\r\n    In this work, we perform the first formal study of the combinations of existing countermeasures and demonstrate that applying Dummy Shuffling (EUROCRYPT 2021) then ISW masking (CRYPTO 2003) to a circuit carries algebraic, correlation, and filtering security - necessary conditions to withstand state-of-the-art automated attacks. We also show that applying these two countermeasures in the opposite order leads to a Higher-Order Filtering attack, highlighting the importance of the order of application of the combined countermeasures.\r\n\r\n    We also propose a new masking scheme called S5, standing for the Semi-Shuffled Secret Sharing Scheme, a scheme merging Dummy Shuffling and ISW in a single countermeasure more efficiently than a direct composition.",

    "abstract": "Zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs) are a powerful tool for proving computation correctness, attracting significant interest from researchers, developers, and users. However, the complexity of zk-SNARKs has created gaps between these groups, hindering progress. Researchers focus on constructing efficient proving systems with stronger security and new properties, while developers and users prioritize toolchains, usability, and compatibility.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we provide a comprehensive study of zk-SNARK, from theory to practice, pinpointing gaps and limitations. We first present a master recipe that unifies the main steps in converting a program into a zk-SNARK. We then classify existing zk-SNARKs according to their key techniques. Our classification addresses the main difference in practically valuable properties between existing zk-SNARK schemes. We survey over 40 zk-SNARKs since 2013 and provide a reference table listing their categories and properties. Following the steps in master recipe, we then survey 11 general-purpose popular used libraries. We elaborate on these libraries' usability, compatibility, efficiency and limitations. Since installing and executing these zk-SNARK systems is challenging, we also provide a completely virtual environment in which to run the compiler for each of them. We identify that the proving system is the primary focus in cryptography academia. In contrast, the constraint system presents a bottleneck in industry. To bridge this gap, we offer recommendations and advocate for the opensource community to enhance documentation, standardization and compatibility.",

    "abstract": "Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is currently being discussed as a technology to safeguard communication in a future where quantum computers compromise traditional public-key cryptosystems. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive security evaluation of QKD-based solutions, focusing on real-world use cases sourced from academic literature and industry reports. We analyze these use cases, assess their security and identify the possible advantages of deploying QKD-based solutions. We further compare QKD-based solutions with Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), the alternative approach to achieving security when quantum computers compromise traditional public-key cryptosystems, evaluating their respective suitability for each scenario. Based on this comparative analysis, we critically discuss and comment on which use cases QKD is suited for, considering factors such as implementation complexity, scalability, and long-term security. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the role QKD could play in future cryptographic infrastructures and offer guidance to decision-makers considering the deployment of QKD.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain service offerings have seen a rapid rise\r\nin recent times. Many of these services realize a decentralized\r\narchitecture with a threshold adversary to avoid a single\r\npoint of failure and to mitigate key escrow issues. While\r\npayments to such services are straightforward in systems\r\nsupporting smart contracts, achieving fairness poses challenges\r\nin systems like Bitcoin, adhering to the UTXO model with\r\nlimited scripting capabilities. This is especially challenging\r\nwithout smart contracts, as we wish to pay only the required\r\nthreshold of t + 1 out of the n servers offering the service\r\ntogether, without any server claiming the payment twice.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce VITARIT 1, a novel payment\r\nsolution tailored for threshold cryptographic services in UTXO\r\nsystems like Bitcoin. Our approach guarantees robust provable\r\nsecurity while facilitating practical deployment. We focus on\r\nthe t-out-of-n distributed threshold verifiable random function\r\n(VRF) service with certain properties, such as threshold BLS\r\nsignatures, a recently highlighted area of interest. Our protocol\r\nenables clients to request verifiable random function (VRF)\r\nvalues from the threshold service, triggering payments to up\r\nto t + 1 servers of the distributed threshold VRF.\r\n\r\nOur efficient design relies on simple transactions using\r\nsignature verification scripts, making it immediately applicable\r\nin Bitcoin-like systems. We also introduce new tools and\r\ntechniques at both the cryptographic and transaction layers,\r\nincluding a novel signature-VRF exchange protocol for standard\r\nconstructions, which may be of independent interest. Addition-\r\nally, our transaction flow design prevents malicious servers\r\nfrom claiming payments twice, offering broader implications for\r\ndecentralized payment systems. Our prototype implementation\r\nshows that in the two-party interaction, the client takes 126.4\r\nmsec, and the server takes 204 msec, demonstrating practicality\r\nand deployability of the system",

    "abstract": "We revisit Updatable Public-Key Encryption (UPKE), which was introduced as a practical mechanism for building forward-secure cryptographic protocols. We begin by observing that all UPKE notions to date are neither syntactically flexible nor secure enough for the most important multi-party protocols motivating UPKE. We provide an intuitive taxonomy of UPKE properties -- some partially or completely overlooked in the past -- along with an overview of known (explicit and implicit) UPKE constructions. We then introduce a formal UPKE definition capturing all intuitive properties needed for multi-party protocols.\r\n\r\nNext, we provide a practical pairing-based construction for which we provide concrete security bounds under a standard assumption in the random oracle and the algebraic group model. The efficiency profile of the scheme compares very favorably with existing UPKE constructions (despite the added flexibility and stronger security). For example, when used to improve the forward security of the Messaging Layer Security protocol [RFC9420], our new UPKE construction requires $\\approx 1\\%$ of the bandwidth of the next-most efficient UPKE construction satisfying the strongest UPKE notion previously considered.",

    "abstract": "Cross-chain bridges, realizing the transfer of information and assets between blockchains, form the core of blockchain interoperability solutions. Most existing bridge networks are modeled in an honest-malicious setting, where the bridge nodes are either honest or malicious. Rationality allows the nodes to deviate from the protocol arbitrarily for an economic incentive. In this work, we present HyperLoop, an efficient cross-chain multi-signature bridge and prove that it is safe and live game-theoretically, under the more realistic rational-malicious model.\r\n\r\nAs rational bridge nodes are allowed to deviate from the protocol and even collude, a monitor mechanism is necessitated, which we realize by introducing whistle-blower nodes. These whistle-blowers constantly check the operations of the bridge and raise complaints to a complaint resolution network in case of discrepancies. To enforce punishments, it is necessary for the nodes to stake an amount before participating as bridge nodes. Consequently, a cap on the volume of funds transferred over the bridge is established. We describe a sliding window mechanism and establish a relation between the stake and the sliding window limit necessary for the safety of the bridge.\r\n\r\nOur design yields an economic, computation, and communication-efficient bridge. We realize and deploy our bridge prototype bridging Ethereum and Polygon chains over testnets. For a 19-node bridge network, each bridge node takes an average of only 3 msec to detect and sign a source chain request, showing the highly efficiency and low-latency of the bridge.",

    "abstract": "Lund et al. (JACM 1992) invented the powerful Sumcheck protocol that has been extensively used in complexity theory and also for designing concretely efficient (zero-knowledge) arguments. In this work, we systematically study Sumcheck in the context of secure multi-party computation (MPC). Our main result is a new generic framework for lifting semi-honest MPC protocols to malicious security, with a {\\em constant} multiplicative overhead in {\\em both} computation and communication, and even additional logarithmic communication in the best case. In general, our approach applies to any semi-honest linear secret-sharing based MPC secure up to additive attacks, where secret-sharings can be added with an authentication property. At a high-level, our approach has a highly distributive flavor, where the parties jointly emulate a Sumcheck prover that proves the correctness of MPC semi-honest evaluations in zero-knowledge, meanwhile they also jointly emulate a Sumcheck verifier and verify the proof themselves. Along the way, we provide a new angle of view on the {\\em fully linear interactive oracle proof} (FLIOP) systems proposed by Boneh et al. (CRYPTO 2019). That is, essentially distributed sumcheck on proving a batch of multiplications is an optimized concrete instantiation of the FLIOP-based approach.\r\n\r\nAs concrete applications of our techniques, we first consider semi-honest MPC protocols based on Shamir secret-sharing with an honest majority. Suppose $M$-party and circuit size $N$, to achieve malicious security, our approach only introduces additional $10MN+O(M\\log{N})$ total computation,  communication of reconstructions of $4\\log{N}+6$ secret-shared values, $O(\\log{N})$ rounds and $O(\\log{N})$ correlated randomness. This shows that malicious security with abort in honest majority MPC comes {\\em free} in terms of both computation and communication.\r\n\r\nWe then consider dishonest majority MPC, where the best known semi-honest protocol achieves $2N$ online communication per party and sublinear preprocessing by using programmable pseudorandom correlation generators (PCGs). We realize malicious MPC with $4N+O(\\log{N})$ online communication as well as sublinear preprocessing, matching the optimal $2\\times$ communication overhead in Hazay et al. (JOC 2024). Our protocol is essentially obtained by using Sumcheck techniques to check authenticated multiplication triple relations, which requires only $N+1$ {\\em standard Beaver triples} and $O(\\log{N})$ random authenticated shares for $N$ semi-honestly generated authenticated triples. Compared to the FLIOP-based checking mechanism (Boyle et al. CRYPTO 2022) that requires $O(\\sqrt{N})$ communication and $O(N^{1.5})$ computation, we do not introduce any cryptographic assumption beyond PCGs, and have $O(N)$ computation.",

    "abstract": "SIMON is a lightweight block cipher proposed by the National Security Agency. \r\nAccording to previous cryptanalytic results on SIMON, differential and linear cryptanalysis are the two most effective attacks on it. \r\nUsually, there are many trails sharing the same input and output differences (resp. masks). \r\nThese trails comprise the differential (resp. linear hull) and can be used together when mounting attacks. \r\nIn ASIACRYPT 2021, Leurent et al. proposed a matrix-based method on SIMON-like ciphers, where only trails whose active bits stay in a $w$-bit window are considered. \r\nThe static window in each round is chosen to be $w$ least significant bits. \r\nThey applied this efficient framework on SIMON and SIMECK, and have obtained many better differentials and linear hulls than before. For SIMON, they also found that there seems to be some potential for improvement, which should be further investigated.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we dynamically choose window for each round to achieve better distinguishers. Benefiting from these dynamic windows, we can obtain stronger differentials and linear hulls than previously proposed for almost all versions of SIMON. \r\nFinally, we provided the best differential/linear attacks on SIMON48, SIMON64, and SIMON96 in terms of round number, complexity, or success rate.",

This ensures that, up to a threshold number, probes placed in different rounds remain independent. Based on this observation, we propose composition theorems for deterministic masking\r\nschemes. On the practical side, we extend the proof of first- and second-order probing security for Ascon\u2019s protected permutation from a single round to an arbitrary number of rounds",

    "abstract": "Payment channels have emerged as a promising solution to address the performance limitations of cryptocurrencies payments, enabling efficient off-chain transactions while maintaining security guarantees. However, existing payment channel protocols, including the widely-deployed Lightning Network and the state-of-the-art Sleepy Channels, suffer from a fundamental vulnerability: non-atomic state transitions create race conditions that can lead to unexpected financial losses. We first formalize current protocols into a common paradigm and prove that this vulnerability is fundamental\u2014any protocol following this paradigm cannot guarantee balance security due to the inherent race conditions in their design. To address this limitation, we propose a novel atomic paradigm for payment channels that ensures atomic state transitions, effectively eliminating race conditions while maintaining all desired functionalities. Based on this paradigm, we introduce Ultraviolet, a secure and efficient payment channel protocol that achieves both atomicity and high performance, while avoiding the introduction of unimplemented Bitcoin features. Ultraviolet reduces the number of required messages per transaction by half compared to existing solutions, while maintaining comparable throughput. We formally prove the security of Ultraviolet under the universal composability framework and demonstrate its practical efficiency through extensive evaluations across multiple regions. This results in a 37% and 52% reduction in latency compared to the Lightning Network and Sleepy Channels, respectively. Regarding throughput, Ultraviolet achieves performance comparable to the Lightning Network and delivers 2\u00d7 the TPS of Sleepy Channels.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we build upon the blinding methods introduced in recent years to enhance the protection of lattice-based cryptographic schemes against side-channel and fault injection attacks. Specifically, we propose a cost-efficient blinded Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) that impedes the convergence of Soft Analytical Side-Channel Attacks (SASCA), even with limited randomness sampling. Additionally, we extend the blinding mechanism based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) and  Redundant Number Representation (RNR) introduced by Heiz and P\u00f6ppelmann by reducing the randomness sampling overhead and accelerating the verification phase.\r\n\r\nThese two blinding mechanisms are nicely compatible with each other's and, when combined, provide enhanced resistance against side-channel attacks, both classical and soft analytical, as well as fault injection attacks, while maintaining high performance and low overhead, making the approach well-suited for practical applications, particularly in resource-constrained IoT environments.",

    "abstract": "We introduce an enhanced requirement of deniable public key encryption that we call dual-deniability. It asks that a sender who is coerced should be able to produce fake randomness, which can explain the target ciphertext as the encryption of any alternative message under any valid key she/he desires to deny. Compared with the original notion of deniability (Canetti et al. in CRYPTO \u201997, hereafter named message-deniability), this term further provides a shield for the anonymity of the receiver against coercion attacks.\r\n      We first give a formal definition of dual-deniability, along with its weak-mode variant. For conceptual understanding, we then show dual-deniability implies semantic security and anonymity against CPA, separates full robustness, and even contradicts key-less or mixed robustness, while is (constructively) implied by key-deniability and full robustness with a minor assumption for bits encryption. As for the availability of dual-deniability, our main scheme is a generic approach from ciphertext-simulatable PKE, where we devise a subtle multi-encryption schema to hide the true message within random masking ciphertexts under plan-ahead setting. Further, we leverage the weak model to present a more efficient scheme having negligible detection probability and constant ciphertext size. Besides, we revisit the notable scheme (Sahai and Waters in STOC \u201914) and show it is inherently dual-deniable. Finally, we extend the Boneh-Katz transform to capture CCA security, deriving dual-deniable and CCA-secure PKE from any selectively dual-deniable IBE under multi-TA setting. Overall our work mounts the feasibility of anonymous messaging against coercion attacks.",

Obliviousness ensures nothing is revealed about the data besides input/output sizes, even against a strong adversary that can observe memory access patterns.\r\nOur solution achieves this by combining trusted hardware with efficient oblivious primitives for compaction and sorting, and two oblivious algorithms: (i) an oblivious aggregation tree, which can be described as a variation of the parallel prefix sum, customized for trusted hardware, and (ii) a novel algorithm for obliviously expanding the elements of a relation.\r\nIn the sequential setting, our oblivious join performs $4.6\\times$- $5.14\\times$ faster than the prior state-of-the-art solution (Krastnikov et al., VLDB 2020) on data sets of size $n=2^{24}$. In the parallel setting, our algorithm achieves a speedup of up to roughly $16\\times$ over the sequential version, when running with 32 threads (becoming up to $80\\times$ compared to the sequential algorithm of Krastnikov et al.).\r\nFinally, our oblivious operators can be used independently to support other oblivious relational database queries, such as oblivious selection and oblivious group-by.",

    "abstract": "Differential cryptanalysis is one of the main methods of cryptanalysis and has been applied to a wide range of ciphers. While it is very successful, it also relies on certain assumptions that do not necessarily hold in practice. One of these is the hypothesis of stochastic equivalence, which states that the probability of a differential characteristic behaves similarly for all keys. Several works have demonstrated examples where this hypothesis is violated, impacting the attack complexity and sometimes even invalidating the investigated prior attacks. Nevertheless, the hypothesis is still typically taken for granted. In this work, we propose AutoDiVer, an automatic tool that allows to thoroughly verify differential characteristics. First, the tool supports calculating the expected probability of differential characteristics while considering the key schedule of the cipher. Second, the tool supports estimating the size of the space of keys for which the characteristic permits valid pairs, and deducing conditions for these keys. AutoDiVer implements a custom SAT modeling approach and takes advantage of a combination of features of advanced SAT solvers, including approximate model counting and clause learning. To show applicability to many different kinds of block ciphers like strongly aligned, weakly aligned, and ARX ciphers, we apply AutoDiVer to GIFT, PRESENT, RECTANGLE, SKINNY, WARP, SPECK, and SPEEDY.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate several computational problems motivated by post-quantum cryptosystems based on isogenies and ideal class group actions on oriented elliptic curves. Our main technical contribution is an efficient algorithm for embedding the ring of integers of an imaginary quadratic field \\( K \\) into some maximal order of the quaternion algebra \\( B_{p,\\infty} \\) ramified at a prime \\( p \\) and infinity. Assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), our algorithm runs in probabilistic polynomial time, improving upon previous results that relied on heuristics or required the factorization of \\( \\textnormal{disc}(K) \\). Notably, this algorithm may be of independent interest.\r\n    Our approach enhances the work of Love and Boneh on computing isogenies between \\( M \\)-small elliptic curves by eliminating heuristics and improving computational efficiency. Furthermore, given a quadratic order \\( \\mathfrak{O} \\) in \\( K \\), we show that our algorithm reduces the computational endomorphism ring problem of \\( \\mathfrak{O} \\)-oriented elliptic curves to the Vectorization problem in probabilistic polynomial time, assuming the conductor of \\( \\mathfrak{O} \\) can be efficiently factorized. Previously, the best known result required the full factorization of \\( \\textnormal{disc}(\\mathfrak{O}) \\), which may be exponentially large.\r\n    Additionally, when the conductor of \\( \\mathfrak{O} \\) can be efficiently factorized, we establish a polynomial-time equivalence between the Quaternion Order Embedding Problem, which asks to embed a quadratic order \\( \\mathfrak{O} \\) into a maximal order in \\( B_{p,\\infty} \\), and computing horizontal isogenies between \\( \\mathfrak{O} \\)-oriented elliptic curves. Leveraging this reduction, we propose a rigorous algorithm, under GRH, that solves the quaternion order embedding problem in time \\( \\tilde{O}(|\\mathrm{disc}(\\mathfrak{O})|^{1/2}) \\), improving upon previous methods that required higher asymptotic time and relied on several heuristics.",

    "abstract": "RingCT signatures are essential components of Ring Confidential Transaction (RingCT) schemes on blockchain platforms, enabling anonymous transaction spending and significantly impacting the scalability of these schemes. This paper makes two primary contributions:\r\n\r\nWe provide the first thorough analysis of a recently developed Any-out-of-N proof in the discrete logarithm (DLOG) setting and the associated RingCT scheme, introduced by ZGSX23 (S&P '23). The proof conceals the number of the secrets to offer greater anonymity than K-out-of-N proofs and uses an efficient \"K-Weight\" technique for its construction. However, we identify for the first time several limitations of using Any-out-of-N proofs, such as increased transaction sizes, heightened cryptographic complexities and potential security risks. These limitations prevent them from effectively mitigating the longstanding scalability bottleneck.\r\n\r\nWe then continue to explore the potential of using K-out-of-N proofs to enhance scalability of RingCT schemes. Our primary innovation is a new DLOG-based RingCT signature that integrates a refined \"K-Weight\"-based K-out-of-N proof and an entirely new tag proof. The latter is the first to efficiently enable the linkability of RingCT signatures derived from the former, effectively resisting double-spending attacks.\r\n\r\nFinally, we identify and patch a linkability flaw in ZGSX23's signature. We benchmark our scheme against this patched one to show that our scheme achieves a boost in scalability, marking a promising step forward.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of finding a path between conjugate supersingular elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ for a prime $p$, which is important for cycle finding in supersingular isogeny graphs. We see that for any given $p$, there is some $l$ corresponding to $p$ which accelerates the process of conjugate path-finding. Also, time-wise, the most efficient way of overviewing the graph is seeing $i(=3)$ steps at once. We have outlined methods in which the next vertex of any pseudo-random walk should be chosen to reach conjugate vertex faster. We have experimentally investigated the paths between frobenius conjugates for wide ranges of small prime $l$. We introduce sets to experimentally learn about the structure of the isogeny graphs when short cycles are present.",

    "abstract": "We study error detection and correction in a computationally bounded world, where errors are introduced by an arbitrary $\\textit{polynomial-time}$ adversarial channel. Our focus is on $\\textit{seeded}$ codes, where the encoding and decoding procedures can share a public random seed, but are otherwise deterministic. We can ask for either $\\textit{selective}$ or $\\textit{adaptive}$ security, depending on whether the adversary can choose the message being encoded before or after seeing the seed. For large alphabets, a recent construction achieves essentially optimal rate versus error tolerance trade-offs under minimal assumptions, surpassing information-theoretic limits. However, for the binary alphabet, the only prior improvement over information theoretic codes relies on non-standard assumptions justified via the random oracle model. We show the following:\r\n\r\n$\\textbf{Selective Security under LWE:}$ Under the learning with errors (LWE) assumption, we construct selectively secure codes over the binary alphabet. For error detection, our codes achieve essentially optimal rate $R \\approx 1$ and relative error tolerance $\\rho \\approx \\frac{1}{2}$. For error correction, they can uniquely correct $\\rho < 1/4$ relative errors with a rate $R$ that essentially matches that of the best list-decodable codes with error tolerance $\\rho$. Both cases provide significant improvements over information-theoretic counterparts. The construction relies on a novel form of 2-input correlation intractable hash functions that we construct from LWE.\r\n\r\n$\\textbf{Adaptive Security via Crypto Dark Matter:}$  Assuming the exponential security of a natural collision-resistant hash function candidate based on the ``crypto dark matter'' approach  of mixing linear functions over different moduli, we construct adaptively secure codes over the binary alphabet, for both error detection and correction. They achieve essentially the same trade-offs between error tolerance $\\rho$ and rate $R$ as above, with the caveat that for error-correction they only do so for sufficiently small values of $\\rho$.",

    "abstract": "It is often desirable to break cryptographic primitives into two components: an input-independent offline component, and a cheap online component used when inputs arrive. Security of such online/offline primitives must be proved in the input-adaptive setting: the adversary chooses its input adaptively, based on what it sees in the offline-phase. Proving security in the input-adaptive setting can be difficult, particularly when one wishes to achieve simulation security and avoid idealized objects like a random oracle (RO).\r\n\r\nThis work proposes a framework for reasoning about input-adaptive primitives: adaptive distributional security (ADS). Roughly, an ADS primitive provides security when it is used with inputs drawn from one of two distributions that are themselves hard to distinguish. ADS is useful as a framework for the following reasons:\r\n    - An ADS definition can often circumvent impossibility results imposed on the corresponding simulation-based definition. This allows us to decrease the online-cost of primitives, albeit by using a weaker notion of security.\r\n    - With care, one can typically upgrade an ADS-secure object into a simulation-secure object (by increasing cost in the online-phase).\r\n    - ADS is robust, in the sense that (1) it enables a form of composition and (2) interesting ADS primitives are highly interconnected in terms of which objects imply which other objects.\r\n    - Many useful ADS-secure objects are plausibly secure from straightforward symmetric-key cryptography.\r\n\r\nWe start by defining the notion of an ADS encryption (ADE) scheme.\r\nA notion of input-adaptive encryption can be easily achieved from RO, and the ADE definition can be understood as capturing the concrete property provided by RO that is sufficient to achieve input-adaptivity. From there, we use ADE to achieve ADS variants of garbled circuits and oblivious transfer, to achieve simulation-secure garbled circuits, oblivious transfer, and two-party computation, and prove interconnectedness of these primitives. In sum, this results in a family of objects with extremely cheap online-cost.",

    "abstract": "The decentralized nature of blockchains is touted to provide censorship resistance. However, in reality, the ability of proposers to completely control the contents of a block makes censorship relatively fragile. To combat this, a notion of inclusion lists has been proposed in the blockchain community. This paper presents the first formal study of inclusion lists. Our inclusion list design leverages multiple proposers to propose transactions and improve censorship resistance. The design has two key components. The first component is a utility-maximizing input list creation mechanism that allows rational proposers to achieve a correlated equilibrium while prioritizing high-value transactions. The second component, AUCIL (auction-based inclusion list), is a mechanism for aggregating the input lists from the proposers to output an inclusion list.",

However, to our knowledge, there is no attack in the literature that takes advantage of an attacker knowing rejected signatures. The aim of this paper is to create a practical black-box attack against Dilithium with a weakened rejection sampling. We succeed in showing that an adversary with enough rejected signatures can recover Dilithium's secret key in less than half an hour on a desktop computer. There is one possible application for this result: by physically preventing one of the rejection sampling tests from happening, we obtain two fault attacks against Dilithium.",

    "abstract": "The present article is a natural extension of the previous one about the GLV method of accelerating a (multi-)scalar multiplication on elliptic curves of moderate CM discriminants $D < 0$. In comparison with the first article, much greater magnitudes of $D$ (in absolute value) are achieved, although the base finite fields of the curves have to be pretty large. This becomes feasible by resorting to quite powerful algorithmic tools developed primarily in the context of lattice-based and isogeny-based cryptography. Curiously, pre-quantum cryptography borrows research outcomes obtained when seeking conversely quantum-resistant solutions or attacks on them. \r\n\r\nFor instance, some $2$-cycle of pairing-friendly MNT curves (with $-D \\approx 100{,}000{,}000$, i.e., $\\log_2(-D) \\approx 26.5$) is relevant for the result of the current article. The given $2$-cycle was generated at one time by Guillevic to provide $\\approx 128$ security bits, hence it was close to application in real-world zk-SNARKs. Another more performant MNT $2$-cycle (with slightly smaller security level, but with much larger $D$) was really employed in the protocol Coda (now Mina) until zero-knowledge proof systems on significantly faster pairing-free (or half-pairing) $2$-cycles were invented. It is also shown in the given work that more lollipop curves, recently proposed by Costello and Korpal to replace MNT ones, are now covered by the GLV technique.",

    "abstract": "This work proposes an encrypted hybrid database framework that combines vectorized data search and relational data query over quantized fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). We observe that, due to the lack of efficient encrypted data ordering capabilities, most existing encrypted database (EDB) frameworks do not support hybrid queries involving both vectorized and relational data. To further enrich query expressiveness while retaining evaluation efficiency, we propose Engorgio, a hybrid EDB framework based on quantized data ordering techniques over FHE.  Specifically, we design a new quantized data encoding scheme along with a set of novel comparison and permutation algorithms to accurately generate and apply orders between large-precision data items. Furthermore, we optimize specific query types, including full table scan, batched query, and Top-k query to enhance the practical performance of the proposed framework. In the experiment, we show that, compared to the state-of-the-art EDB frameworks, Engorgio is up to 28x--854x faster in homomorphic comparison, 65x--687x faster in homomorphic sorting and 15x--1,640x faster over a variety of end-to-end relational, vectorized, and hybrid SQL benchmarks. Using Engorgio, the amortized runtime for executing a relational and hybrid query on a 48-core processor is under 3 and 75 seconds, respectively, over a 10K-row hybrid database.",

    "abstract": "We propose a sublinear-sized proof system for rank-one constraint satisfaction over polynomial rings (Ring-R1CS), particularly for rings of the form $Z_{Q}[X]/(X^N+1)$. These rings are widely used in lattice-based constructions, \r\nwhich underlie many modern post-quantum cryptographic schemes. \r\nConstructing efficient proof systems for arithmetic over these rings is challenged by two key obstacles: (1) Under practical popular choices of $Q$ and $N$, the ring $Z_{Q}[X]/(X^N+1)$ is not field-like, and thus tools like Schwartz\u2013Zippel lemma cannot apply; (2) when $N$ is large, which is common in implementations of lattice-based cryptosystems, the ring is large, causing the proof size suboptimal.\r\nIn this paper, we address these two obstacles, enabling more efficient proofs for arithmetics over $Z_{Q}[X]/(X^N+1)$ when $Q$ is a `lattice-friendly' modulus, \r\nincluding moduli that support fast NTT computation or power-of-two moduli. \r\nOur primary tool is a novel \\emph{ring switching} technique. \r\nThe core idea of ring switching is to convert the R1CS over $Z_{Q}[X]/(X^N+1)$ into another R1CS instance over Galois rings, which is field-like and small (with size independent with $N$).\r\nAs (zero-knowledge) proofs have many applications in cryptography, we expect that efficient proof systems for polynomial ring arithmetic could lead to more efficient constructions of advanced primitives from lattice assumptions, such as aggregate signatures, group signatures, verifiable random function, or verifiable fully holomorphic encryption.",

    "abstract": "Multiplication and other non-linear operations are widely recognized as the most costly components of secure two-party computation (2PC) based on linear secret sharing. Multiplication and non-linear operations are well known to be the most expensive protocols in secure two-party computation (2PC). Moreover, the comparison protocol (or $\\mathsf{Wrap}$ protocol) is essential for various operations such as truncation, signed extension, and signed non-uniform multiplication. This paper aims to optimize these protocols by avoiding invoking the costly comparison protocol, thereby improving their efficiency.\r\n\r\nWe propose a novel approach to study 2PC from a geometric perspective. Specifically, we interpret the two shares of a secret as the horizontal and vertical coordinates of a point in a Cartesian coordinate system, with the secret itself represented as the corresponding point. This reformulation allows us to address the comparison problem by determining the region where the point lies. Furthermore, we identify scenarios where the costly comparison protocol can be replaced by more efficient evaluating AND gate protocols within a constrained range. Using this method, we improve protocols for truncation, signed extension and signed non-uniform multiplication, all of which are fundamental to 2PC. In particular, for the one-bit error truncation protocol and signed extension protocols, we reduce the state-of-the-art communication complexities of Cheetah (USENIX\u201922) and SirNN (S\\&P\u201921) from $\\approx \\lambda (l + 1)$ to $\\approx \\lambda$ in two rounds, where $l$ is the input length and $\\lambda$ is the security parameter. For signed multiplication with non-uniform bit-width, we reduce the communication cost of SirNN's by 40\\% to 60\\%.",

    "abstract": "Quantum money is the cryptographic application of the quantum no-cloning theorem. It has recently been instantiated by Montgomery and Sharif (Asiacrypt'24) from class group actions on elliptic curves. In this work, we propose a novel method to forge a quantum banknote by leveraging the efficiency of evaluating division polynomials with the coordinates of rational points, offering a more efficient alternative to brute-force attack. Since our attack still requires exponential time, it remains impractical to forge a quantum banknote. Interestingly, due to the inherent properties of quantum money, our attack method also results in a more efficient verification procedure. As our algorithm employs the rational points and the quadratic twists to verify the cardinality of the superposition of elliptic curves, we expect it to inspire future research on elliptic-curve-based quantum cryptography.",

    "abstract": "Distributed certification is a set of mechanisms that allows an all-knowing prover to convince the units of a communication network that the network's state has some desired property, such as being $3$-colorable or triangle-free. Classical mechanisms, such as proof labeling schemes (PLS), consist of a message from the prover to each unit, followed by on-e round of communication between each unit and its neighbors. \r\nLater works consider extensions, called distributed interactive proofs, where the prover and the units can have multiple rounds of communication before the communication among the units. Recently, Bick, Kol, and Oshman (SODA '22) defined a zero-knowledge version of distributed interactive proofs, where the prover convinces the units of the network\u2019s state without revealing any other information about the network\u2019s state or structure.  In their work, they propose different variants of this model and show that many graph properties of interest can be certified with them.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we define and study distributed non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (dNIZK); these can be seen as a non-interactive version of the aforementioned model, and also as a zero-knowledge version of PLS.  We prove the following: \r\n\r\n- There exists a dNIZK protocol for $3$-coloring with  $O(\\log n)$-bit messages from the prover and $O(\\log n)$-size messages among neighbors. This disproves a conjecture from previous work asserting that the total number of bits from the prover should grow linearly with the number of edges.  \r\n\r\n- There exists a family of dNIZK protocols for triangle-freeness, that presents a trade-off between the size of the messages from the prover and the size of the messages among neighbors. Interestingly, we also introduce a variant of this protocol where the message size depends only on the maximum degree of a node and not on the total number of nodes, improving upon the previous non-zero-knowledge protocol for this problem.  \r\n\r\n-  There exists a dNIZK protocol for any graph property in NP in the random oracle models, which is secure against an arbitrary number of malicious parties. Previous work considered compilers from PLS to distributed zero-knowledge protocol, which results in protocols with parameters that are incomparable to ours.",

    "abstract": "Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is a privacy-enhancing technology that enables computation over encrypted data without the need for decryption. A primary application of HE is in the construction of communication-efficient Two-Party Computation (2PC) protocols between a client and a server, serving as the key owner and the evaluator, respectively. In this context, it is reasonable to assume that the evaluation circuit involves some confidential information of the server; otherwise, the client could compute it on their own. However, the 2PC protocol built on an HE scheme is not necessarily secure, as the standard IND-CPA security of HE does not guarantee the privacy of the evaluation circuit. Several enhanced security notions for HE, such as circuit privacy and sanitization, have been proposed to address this issue, but they require significant overhead in terms of parameter size or complexity.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we introduce a novel security notion for HE, called ciphertext simulatability, which precisely captures the security requirements of HE in the construction of 2PC. Then, we provide a concrete construction of ciphertext-simulatable HE from the BFV scheme by modifying its evaluation algorithm. We provide theoretical analysis and demonstrate experimental results to ensure that our solution has insignificant overhead in terms of parameter size and error growth. As a matter of independent interest, we demonstrate how our approach of designing ciphertext-simulatable BFV can be further extended to satisfy stronger security notions such as sanitization.",

    "abstract": "Deniable Authentication is a highly desirable guarantee for secure messaging: it allows Alice to authentically send a message $m$ to a designated receiver Bob in a *Plausibly Deniable* manner. Concretely, while Bob is guaranteed Alice sent $m$, he cannot convince a judge Judy that Alice really sent this message---even if he gives Judy his secret keys. This is because Judy knows Bob *can* make things up. This paper models the security of Multi-Designated Verifier Signatures (MDVS) and Multi-Designated Receiver Signed Public Key Encryption (MDRS-PKE)---two (related) types of schemes that provide such guarantees---in the Constructive Cryptography (CC) framework (Maurer and Renner, ICS '11).\r\n\r\nThe only work modeling dishonest parties' ability of \"making things up\" was by Maurer et al. (ASIACRYPT '21), who modeled the security of MDVS, also in CC. Their security model has two fundamental limitations:\r\n  1. deniability is not guaranteed when honest receivers read;\r\n  2. it relies on the CC-specific concept of specifications.  \r\n\r\nWe solve both problems. Regarding the latter, our model is a standard simulator-based one. Furthermore, our composable treatment allowed to identify a new property, Forgery Invalidity, without which we do not know how to prove the deniability of neither MDVS nor MDRS-PKE when honest receivers read. Finally, we prove that Chakraborty et al.'s MDVS (EUROCRYPT '23) has this property, and that Maurer et al.'s MDRS-PKE (EUROCRYPT '22) preserves it from the underlying MDVS.",

    "abstract": "Payment channels are auspicious candidates in layer-2 solutions to reduce the number of on-chain transactions on traditional blockchains and increase transaction throughput. To construct payment channels, peers lock funds on 2-of-2 multisig addresses and open channels between one another to transact via instant peer-to-peer transactions. Transactions between peers without a direct channel are made possible by routing the payment over a series of adjacent channels. In certain cases, this can lead to relatively low transaction success rates and high transaction fees. In this work, we introduce pliability to constructing payment channels and graft edges with more than two endpoints into the payment graph. We refer to these constructions as hyperedges. We present hyperedge-based topologies to form hypergraphs and compare them to Bitcoin's Lightning network and other state-of-the-art solutions. The results demonstrate that hyperedge-based implementations can both increase transaction success rate, in addition to decreasing the network cost by more than 50% compared to that of the Lightning Network.",

    "abstract": "We present new techniques for garbling mixed arithmetic and boolean circuits, utilizing the homomorphic secret sharing scheme introduced by Roy \\& Singh (Crypto 2021), along with the half-tree protocol developed by Guo et al (Eurocrypt 2023). Compared to some two-party interactive protocols, our mixed garbling only requires several times $(<10)$ more communication cost.\r\n\r\nWe construct the bit decomposition/composition gadgets with communication cost $O((\\lambda+\\lambda_{\\text{DCR}}/k)b)$ for integers in the range $(-2^{b-1}, 2^{b-1})$, requiring $O(2^k)$ computations for the GGM-tree. Our approach is compatible with constant-rate multiplication protocols, and the cost decreases as $k$ increases. Even for a small $k=8$, the concrete efficiency ranges from $6\\lambda b$ ($b \\geq 1000$ bits) to $9\\lambda b$ ($b \\sim 100$ bits) per decomposition/composition. In addition, we develop the efficient gadgets for mod $q$ and unsigned truncation based on bit decomposition and composition.\r\n\r\nWe construct efficient arithmetic gadgets over various domains. For bound integers, we improve the multiplication rate in the work of Meyer et al. (TCC 2024) from $\\textstyle\\frac{\\zeta-2}{\\zeta+1}$ to $\\frac{\\zeta-2}{\\zeta}$. We propose new garbling schemes over other domains through bounded integers with our modular and truncation gadgets, which is more efficient than previous constructions. For $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^b}$, additions and multiplication can be garbled with a communication cost comparable to our bit decomposition. For general finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, particularly for large values of $p$ and $n$, we garble the addition and multiplication at the cost of $O((\\lambda+\\lambda_{\\text{DCR}}/k)b)$, where $b = n\\lceil \\log p \\rceil$. For applications to real numbers, we introduce an ``error-based'' truncation that makes the cost of multiplication dependent solely on the desired precision.",

    "abstract": "NovaTEE is a novel private multilateral settlement network designed to address critical inefficiencies in both traditional financial markets and cryptocurrency trading. The current clearing landscape suffers from fragmented capital allocation, restrictive prime brokerage relationships, and prolonged settlement timeframes in traditional finance, while cryptocurrency markets face challenges with over-collateralization, siloed lending pools, and security risks from centralized exchanges.\r\n\r\nWe introduce a settlement system that leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and threshold cryptography to enable secure, private, and efficient settlement of obligations between multiple parties. The system utilizes a distributed key generation model and novel clearing mechanisms to optimize capital efficiency through multilateral netting, while maintaining strong privacy guarantees and regulatory compliance capabilities. By combining TEE-based security with advanced cryptographic protocols, including zero-knowledge proofs and sparse Merkle trees for data verification, our solution enables efficient cross-venue and cross-chain settlement while protecting sensitive trading information. This approach significantly reduces capital requirements for market participants, optimizes transaction costs, and provides institutional-grade clearing infrastructure without compromising on security or privacy. The system's architecture ensures that no single party has complete access to transaction details while maintaining auditability through a distributed backup network, offering a practical solution for institutional adoption of on-chain settlement.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces practical schemes for keyword Private Information Retrieval (keyword PIR), enabling private queries on public databases using keywords. Unlike standard index-based PIR, keyword PIR presents greater challenges, since the query's position within the database is unknown and the domain of keywords is vast. Our key insight is to construct an efficient and compact key-to-index mapping, thereby reducing the keyword PIR problem to standard PIR. To achieve this, we propose three constructions incorporating several new techniques. The high-level approach involves (1) encoding the server's key-value database into an indexable database with a key-to-index mapping and (2) invoking standard PIR on the encoded database to retrieve specific positions based on the mapping. We conduct comprehensive experiments, with results showing substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art keyword PIR, ChalametPIR (CCS'24), i.e., a $15\\sim178 \\times$ reduction in communication and $1.1 \\sim 2.4 \\times$ runtime improvement, depending on database size and entry length. Our constructions are practical, executing keyword PIR in just 47 ms for a database containing 1 million 32-byte entries.",

    "abstract": "Differential privacy (DP) is a fundamental technique used in machine learning (ML) training for protecting the privacy of sensitive individual user data. In the past few years, a new approach for combining prior-based Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanisms with a relaxed DP criterion, known as Label DP, has shown great promise in increasing the utility of the final trained model without compromising on the DP privacy budget. In this work, we identify a crucial privacy gap in the current implementations of these prior-based LDP mechanisms, namely the leakage of sensitive priors. We address the challenge of implementing such LDP mechanisms without leaking any information about the priors while preserving the efficiency and accuracy of the current insecure implementations. To that end, we design simple and efficient secure two-party computation (2PC) protocols for addressing this challenge, implement them, and perform end-to-end testing on standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10. Our empirical results indicate that the added security benefit essentially comes almost for free in the sense that the gap between the current insecure implementations and our proposed secure version, in terms of run-time overhead and accuracy degradation, is minimal. E.g., for CIFAR-10, with strong DP privacy parameter, the additional runtime due to 2PC is $\\approx 3.9\\%$ over WAN with $0.4\\%$ decrease in accuracy over an insecure (non-2PC) approach.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of quantum computers, optimizing the quantum implementations of symmetric-key ciphers, which constitute the primary components of the quantum oracles used in quantum attacks based on Grover and Simon's algorithms, has become an active topic in the cryptography community. In this field, a challenge is to construct quantum circuits that require the least amount of quantum resources. In this work, we aim to address the problem of constructing quantum circuits with the minimal T-depth or width (number of qubits) for nonlinear components, thereby enabling implementations of symmetric-key ciphers with the minimal T-depth or width. Specifically, we propose several general methods for obtaining quantum implementation of generic vectorial Boolean functions and multiplicative inversions in GF(2^n), achieving the minimal T-depth and low costs across other metrics. As an application, we present a highly compact T-depth-3 Clifford+T circuit for the AES S-box. Compared to the T-depth-3 circuits presented in previous works (ASIACRYPT 2022, IEEE TC 2024), our circuit has significant reductions in T-count, full depth and Clifford gate count. Compared to the state-of-the-art T-depth-4 circuits, our circuit not only achieves the minimal T-depth but also exhibits reduced full depth and closely comparable width. This leads to lower costs for the DW-cost and T-DW-cost. Additionally, we propose two methods for constructing minimal-width implementations of vectorial Boolean functions. As applications, for the first time, we present a 9-qubit Clifford+T circuit for the AES S-box, a 16-qubit Clifford+T circuit for a pair of AES S-boxes, and a 5-qubit Clifford+T circuit for the chi function of SHA3. These circuits can be used to derive quantum circuits that implement AES or SHA3 without ancilla qubits.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces \"Little OaldresPuzzle_Cryptic,\" a novel lightweight symmetric encryption algorithm.\r\n\r\nAt the core of this algorithm are two main cryptographic components: the NeoAlzette permutation S-box based on ARX (Addition-Rotation-XOR) primitives and the innovative pseudo-random number generator XorConstantRotation (XCR), used exclusively in the key expansion process. The NeoAlzette S-box, a non-linear function for 32-bit pairs, is meticulously designed for both encryption strength and operational efficiency, ensuring robust security in resource-constrained environments. During the encryption and decryption processes, a pseudo-randomly selected mixed linear diffusion function, distinct from XCR, is applied, enhancing the complexity and unpredictability of the encryption.\r\n\r\nWe comprehensively explore the various technical aspects of the Little OaldresPuzzle_Cryptic algorithm.\r\n\r\nIts design aims to balance speed and security in the encryption process, particularly for high-speed data transmission scenarios. Recognizing that resource efficiency and execution speed are crucial for lightweight encryption algorithms, without compromising security, we conducted a series of statistical tests to validate the cryptographic security of our algorithm. These tests included assessments of resistance to linear and differential cryptanalysis, among other measures.\r\n\r\nBy combining the NeoAlzette S-box with sophisticated key expansion using XCR, and integrating the pseudo-randomly selected mixed linear diffusion function in its encryption and decryption processes, our algorithm significantly enhances its capability to withstand advanced cryptographic analysis techniques while maintaining lightweight and efficient operation. Our test results demonstrate that the Little OaldresPuzzle_Cryptic algorithm effectively supports the encryption and decryption needs of high-speed data, ensuring robust security and making it an ideal choice for various modern cryptographic application scenarios.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Symmetric Encryption Algorithm, Lightweight Cryptography, ARX Primitives, PRNG, NeoAlzette S-boxes, XorConstantRotation, Diffusion and Confusion Layers, Cryptographic Security, Statistical Tests, Resource-Constrained Environments.",

    "abstract": "Rejection sampling is a crucial security mechanism in lattice-based signature schemes that follow the Fiat-Shamir with aborts paradigm, such as ML-DSA/CRYSTALS-Dilithium. This technique transforms secret-dependent signature samples into ones that are statistically close to a secret-independent distribution (in the random oracle model). While many side-channel attacks have directly targeted sensitive data such as nonces, secret keys, and decomposed commitments, fewer studies have explored the potential leakage associated with rejection sampling. Notably, Karabulut~et~al. showed that leakage from rejected challenges can undermine, but not entirely break, the security of the Dilithium scheme.\r\n\r\nMotivated by the above, we convert the problem of key recovery (from the leakage of rejection sampling) to an integer linear programming problem (ILP), where rejected responses of unique Hamming weights set upper/lower constraints of the product between the challenge and the private key. We formally study the worst-case complexity of the problem as well as empirically confirm the practicality of the rejected challenge attack. For all three security levels of Dilithium-2/3/5, our attack recovers the private key in seconds or minutes with a 100% Success Rate (SR).\r\n\r\nOur attack leverages knowledge of the rejected challenge and response, and thus we propose methods to extract this information by exploiting side-channel leakage from  Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) operations. We demonstrate the practicality of this rejected challenge attack by using real side-channel leakage on a Dilithium-2 implementation running on an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first efficient side-channel key recovery attack on ML-DSA/Dilithium that targets the rejection sampling procedure. Furthermore, we discuss some countermeasures to mitigate this security issue.",

    "abstract": "Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables the computation of arbitrary circuits over encrypted data. A widespread application of FHE is a simple two-party computation (2PC) protocol, where the server evaluates a circuit over the client's encrypted data and its private inputs. However, while the security of FHE guarantees that the client's data is protected from the server, there is no inherent support for the privacy of the server's input and the circuit.\r\n\r\nOne effective solution to this problem is an additional algorithm for FHE called sanitization, introduced by Ducas and Stehl\u00e9 (Eurocrypt 2016). Roughly speaking, a sanitization algorithm removes any meaningful information contained in the ciphertext, including previous evaluations of circuits. Following their definition, several constructions for sanitization have been proposed, particularly for TFHE. However, all of these methods were impractical, requiring several bootstrappings or an excessive amount of randomized evaluations.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we construct a novel sanitization algorithm for TFHE that overcomes these issues. Our method only adds two lightweight randomization steps to the original TFHE bootstrapping, without any modifications to the core algorithms. As a result, our algorithm achieves sanitization with a single bootstrapping and minimal randomization, bringing sanitization closer to practicality.\r\n\r\nTo empirically evaluate the efficiency of our method, we provide concrete benchmark results based on our proof-of-concept implementation. Our algorithm sanitizes a single TFHE ciphertext in 35.88 ms, which is only 3.4% (1.18 ms) slower than the original TFHE bootstrapping with the same parameters. When directly compared to previous works, our method achieves a speedup by a factor of 4.82 to 209.03.",

    "abstract": "We present the first protocol for efficient Fuzzy Private Set Intersection (PSI) that achieves linear communication complexity, does not depend on restrictive assumptions on the distribution of party inputs, and abstains from inefficient fully homomorphic encryption. Specifically, our protocol enables two parties to compute all pairs of elements from their respective sets that are within a given Hamming distance, without constraints on how these sets are structured.\r\n\r\nOur key insight is that securely computing the (threshold) Hamming distance between two inputs can be reduced to securely computing their inner product. Leveraging this reduction, we construct a Fuzzy PSI protocol using recent techniques for inner-product predicate encryption. To enable the use of predicate encryption in our setting, we establish that these predicate encryption schemes satisfy a weak notion of simulation security and demonstrate how their internal key derivation can be efficiently distributed without a trusted third party.\r\n\r\nAs a result, our Fuzzy PSI on top of predicate encryption features not only asymptotically optimal linear communication complexity but is also concretely practical.",

    "abstract": "The Log Structured Merge (LSM) Tree is a popular choice for key-value stores that focus on optimized write throughput while maintaining performant, production-ready read latencies. To optimize read performance, LSM stores rely on a probabilistic data structure called the Bloom Filter (BF). In this paper, we focus on adversarial workloads that lead to a sharp degradation in read performance by impacting the accuracy of BFs used within the LSM store. Our evaluation shows up to $800\\%$ increase in the read latency of lookups for popular LSM stores. We define adversarial models and security definitions for LSM stores. We implement adversary resilience into two popular LSM stores, LevelDB and RocksDB. We use our implementations to demonstrate how performance degradation under adversarial workloads can be mitigated.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we demonstrate that Ethereum's current proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism poses a significant threat to decentralisation. Our research focuses on the manipulability of distributed randomness beacons (DRBs) in leader selection. Specifically, we show that RANDAO - Ethereum's DRB - is seriously vulnerable to manipulations in its current form.  For example, if a lucrative slot is foreseen, there is a risk that staking entities may temporarily collude to control $33\\%$ of the validators, enabling them to execute a series of RANDAO manipulation attacks that secure the target slot with a $99.5\\%$ success rate. The effectiveness of our method stems from the fact that we work with a significantly richer model of the possible attacks compared to previous works. Our manipulative strategies work by missing blocks from the canonical chain - either by withholding blocks in the adversary's own slots or by forking out blocks proposed by others. We argue that while PoS can pave the path in the future for blockchains, Ethereum's current DRB implementation has to be replaced with a more secure mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Quantum cryptography allows to achieve security goals which are unobtainable using classical cryptography alone: it offers the promise of everlasting privacy. Thatis, an adversary trying to attack a protocol must succeed during the run of the protocol.\r\nAfter the protocol has terminated, security holds unconditionally.\r\nIn this work, we initiate the study of a new model which we call the quantum decoherence model (QDM). In a nutshell, this model captures adversaries that are computationally bounded during the run of a protocol (and some time after), but become computationally unbounded long after the protocol terminates. Importantly, once the adversary becomes computationally unbounded, he can only remember a bounded number of qubits from before the computational bound was lifted.\r\nWe provide a variant of the Universal Composability framework which captures the new notion of quantum decoherence and augment it with quantum random oracles. As our main contribution, we construct a non-interactive commitment scheme achieving unconditional and statistical security against malicious senders and everlasting security against malicious receivers under our new security notion. Such commitments imply general secure multiparty computation with everlasting security.\r\nFinally, we show that our core technique can be applied to a broader spectrum of problems. We show that it gives rise to everlasting public key encryption and OT in the QDM. Finally, we also consider the weaker notion of incompressible encryption in the setting of quantum decoherence, and show that post-quantum IND-CPA secure public\r\nkey encryption is sufficient to realize this notion without resorting to random oracles.\r\nAt the technical core of our constructions is a new, conceptually simple yet powerful reverse entropic uncertainty relation.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a general, low-cost, low-power statistical test for\r\ntransactions in transaction protocols with small anonymity set authentication (TPSASAs), such as Monero. The test classifies transactions as ad hoc (spontaneously constructed to spend a deterministically selected key) or self-churned (constructed from a probability distribution very close to that of the default wallet software, and with the same sender and receiver). The test is a uniformly most powerful (UMP) likelihood ratio tests (LRT) from the Neyman-Pearson Lemma, and makes no assumptions about user behavior. We extend these tests to expoit prior information about user behavior. We discuss test parameterization, as well as how anonymity set cardinality and user behavior impact test performance. We also describe a maximum-likelihood de-anonymization attack on Monero based on our test.",

    "abstract": "The ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD scheme is widely used as an alternative for AES-GCM on platforms without AES hardware instructions. Although recent analysis by Degabriele et al. shows that ChaCha20-Poly1305 provides adequate security in the conventional multiuser model, the construction is totally broken when a single nonce is repeated \u2013 a real-word scenario that can occur due to faulty implementations or the desire to use random nonces.\r\n\r\nWe present a new nonce-misuse resistant and key-committing authenticated encryption scheme, called ChaCha20-Poly1305-PSIV, that is based on carefully combining the ChaCha20-Poly1305 building blocks into the NSIV paradigm proposed by Peyrin and Seurin (CRYPTO 2016) without performance loss. We analyze the security of the underlying mode PSIV in the multi-user faulty-nonce model assuming that the underlying permutation is ideal, and prove its key-committing security in the cmt-1 model. Rust and C implementations are provided, and benchmarks confirm that performance is comparable to the ChaCha20-Poly1305 implementation in libsodium.\r\n\r\nIn terms of security and efficiency (without hardware support), our proposal compares favorably to AES-GCM-SIV. Since we reuse the ChaCha20-Poly1305 building blocks, we expect ChaCha20-Poly1305-PSIV to benefit from existing analysis and to be easy to deploy in practice.",

    "abstract": "It is well-known that any single-server PIR scheme with sublinear communication necessitates public-key cryptography. Several recent studies, which we collectively refer to as lightweight PIR, demonstrate that this limitation can be circumvented to some extent. However, all such schemes require at least $O(n^{1/2})$ communication per-query, where $n$ is the size of the database. Indeed, the celebrated result provided by Ishai et al. (Crypto '24) implies that, with solely symmetric-key cryptography,  achieving per-query communication below  $O(n^{1/2})$  necessitates more than $O(n^{1/2})$ client storage. Whether this barrier can be overcome with limited use of public-key cryptography remains an open question. In this paper, we tackle this question by presenting the first lightweight single-server PIR scheme with $O_\\lambda(n^{1/3})$ communication while allowing arbitrary (non-zero) client storage.",

    "abstract": "Time-lock puzzles are cryptographic primitives that guarantee to the generator that the puzzle cannot be solved in less than $\\mathcal{T}$ sequential computation steps. They have recently found numerous applications, e.g., in fair contract signing and seal-bid auctions. However, solvers have no a priori guarantee about the solution they will reveal, e.g., about its ``usefulness'' within a certain application scenario. In this work, we propose verifiable time-lock puzzles (VTLPs) that address this by having the generator publish a succinct proof that the solution satisfies certain properties (without revealing anything else about it). Hence solvers are now motivated to ``commit'' resources into solving the puzzle. We propose VTLPs that support proving arbitrary NP relations $\\mathcal{R}$ about the puzzle solution. \r\nAt a technical level, to overcome the performance hurdles of the ``naive'' approach of simply solving the puzzle within a SNARK that also checks $\\mathcal{R}$, our scheme combines the ``classic'' RSA time-lock puzzle of Rivest, Shamir, and Wagner, with novel building blocks for ``offloading'' expensive modular group exponentiations and multiplications from the SNARK circuit. We then propose a second VTLP specifically for checking RSA-based signatures and verifiable random functions (VRFs). Our second scheme does not rely on a SNARK and can have several applications, e.g., in the context of distributed randomness generation. Along the road, we propose new constant-size proofs for modular exponent relations over hidden-order groups that may be of independent interest. Finally, we experimentally evaluate the performance of our schemes and report the findings and comparisons with prior approaches.",

    "abstract": "Isogeny-based cryptography relies its security on the hardness of the supersingular isogeny problem: finding an isogeny between two supersingular curves defined over a quadratic field.\r\n\r\nThe Delfs-Galbraith algorithm is the most efficient procedure for solving the supersingular isogeny problem with a time complexity of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(p^{1/2})$ operations. The bottleneck of the Delfs-Galbraith algorithm is the so-called subfield curve search (i.e., finding an isogenous supersingular elliptic curve defined over the base field), which determines the time complexity.\r\n\r\nGiven that, for efficiency, most recent isogeny-based constructions propose using finite fields with field characteristics equal to $p = 2^a \\cdot f - 1$ for some positive integers $a$ and $f$.\r\nThis work focuses on primes of that particular form, and it presents two new algorithms for finding subfield curves with a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(p^{1/2})$ operations and a memory complexity polynomial in $\\log_2{p}$. Such algorithms exploit the existence of large torsion-$2^a$ points and extend the subfield root detection algorithm of Santos, Costello, and Shi (Crypto 2022) to our case study. In addition, it is worth highlighting that these algorithms easily extend to primes of the form $p =2^a \\cdot f + 1$ and $p = \\ell^a \\cdot f - 1$ with $\\ell$ being a small integer. \r\n\r\nThis study also examines the usage of radical $3$-isogenies with the proposed extended subfield root detection algorithm. In this context, the results indicate that the radical $3$-isogeny approach is competitive compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The Linear Code Equivalence ($\\mathsf{LCE}$) problem asks, for two given linear codes $\\mathcal{C}, \\mathcal{C}'$, to find a monomial $\\mathbf{Q}$ mapping $\\mathcal{C}$ into $\\mathcal{C}'$. Algorithms solving $\\mathsf{LCE}$ crucially rely on a (heuristic) subroutine, which recovers the secret monomial from $\\Omega(\\log n)$ pairs of codewords $(\\mathbf{v}_i, \\mathbf{w}_i)\\in \\mathcal{C} \\times \\mathcal{C}'$ satisfying $\\mathbf{w}_i = \\mathbf{v}_i\\mathbf{Q}$. We greatly improve on this known bound by giving a constructive (heuristic) algorithm that recovers the secret monomial from any \\emph{two} pairs of such codewords for any $q\\geq 23$. We then show that this reduction in the number of required pairs enables the design of a more efficient algorithm for solving the $\\mathsf{LCE}$ problem. Our asymptotic analysis shows that this algorithm outperforms previous approaches for a wide range of parameters, including all parameters proposed across the literature. Furthermore, our concrete analysis reveals significant bit security reductions for suggested parameters. Most notably, in the context of the LESS signature scheme, a second-round contender in the ongoing NIST standardization effort for post-quantum secure digital signatures, we obtain bit security reductions of up to 24 bits.",

    "abstract": "Network agnostic protocols (Blum, Katz, Loss TCC `19) are consensus or MPC protocols that strike a balance between purely synchronous and asynchronous protocols. Given thresholds $t_a,t_s$ that satisfy $t_a<n/3<t_s<n/2$ and $2t_s+t_a<n$, they have the unique property of remaining secure against an adversary that either (1) corrupts up to $t_s$ parties in a synchronous execution where all messages are delivered within a known bound $\\Delta$ or (2) corrupts up to $t_a$ in an asynchronous execution where messages can be delayed arbitrarily. All existing network agnostic protocols follow a design pattern which first attempts to run a synchronous path, and then switches to an asynchronous path as a fallback option if the synchronous path times out after some time $T$ due to the network being asynchronous. Unfortunately, $T$ has to be set conservatively to account for the possibility that the synchronous path might take an unusually long time even when the network is synchronous. As a result, for various basic tasks including Byzantine Agreement or MPC, no existing network agnostic protocol is able to terminate for all honest parties within constant expected time in all possible executions.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we introduce a new paradigm to construct network agnostic consensus (and MPC) that, for the first time overcome this barrier. Using this new design pattern we first present simple protocols for reliable broadcast (RB) and binary agreement (BA)\r\nthat are responsive when no more than $t_a$ parties are corrupted and run in expected constant time regardless of the network conditions. We then extend our results to asynchronous common subset (ACS) and MPC. Notably, our approach reverses the order of the synchronous and asynchronous path by designing protocols that are first and foremost asynchronous and only fall back to the synchronous execution path when more than $t_a$ parties are corrupted.",

    "abstract": "The Messaging Layer Security protocol MLS is standardized in IETF\u2019s RFC 9420 and allows a group of parties to securely establish and evolve group keys even if the servers are malicious. Its core mechanism is based on the TreeKEM protocol, but has gained many additional features and modifications during the development of the MLS standard. Over the last years, several partial security analyses have appeared of incomplete drafts of the protocol. One of the major additions to the TreeKEM design in MLS RFC 9420 (the final version of the standard) are the external operations, i.e., external commits and proposals, which interact deeply with the core TreeKEM protocol. These operations have not been considered in any previous security analysis, leaving their impact on the protocol\u2019s overall security unclear.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we formalize ETK: External-Operations TreeKEM that includes external commits and proposals. We develop a corresponding ideal functionality $F_\\mathit{ECGKA}$ and prove that ETK indeed realizes $F_\\mathit{ECGKA}$.\r\n\r\nOur work is the first cryptographic analysis that considers both the final changes to the standard\u2019s version of TreeKEM as well as external proposals and external commits. Compared to previous works that considered MLS draft versions, our ETK protocol is by far the closest to the final MLS RFC 9420 standard. Our analysis implies that the core of MLS\u2019s TreeKEM variant as defined in RFC 9420 is an ETK protocol that realizes $F_\\mathit{ECGKA}$, when used with an SUF-CMA secure signature scheme, such as the IETF variant of Ed25519. We show that contrary to previous claims, MLS does not realize $F_\\mathit{ECGKA}$ [Crypto2022] when used with signature schemes that only guarantee EUF-CMA, such as ECDSA.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we show that the security of the protocol could be further strengthened by adding a functionality to insert PSKs, allowing another form of healing, and give a corresponding construction ETK-PSK and ideal functionality $F_{\\mathit{ECGKA}^\\mathit{PSK}}$ .",

    "abstract": "A privately constrained pseudorandom function (pCPRF) is a PRF with the additional property that one can derive a constrained key that allows evaluating the PRF only on inputs satisfying a constraint predicate $C$, without revealing $C$ itself or leaking information about the PRF\u2019s output on inputs that do not satisfy the constraint.\r\n\r\nExisting privately constrained PRFs face significant limitations: either (1) they rely on assumptions known to imply fully-homomorphic encryption or indistinguishability obfuscation, (2) they support only highly restricted classes of constraints\u2014for instance, no known group-based pCPRF even supports the simple class of puncturing constraints (where the constrained key permits evaluation on all but one point while hiding the punctured point), or (3) they are limited to polynomial-size input domains. A long-standing open question has been whether one can construct a privately constrained PRF from group-based assumptions for more expressive classes of constraints. In this work, we present a pCPRF based on the decisional composite residuosity (DCR) assumption that supports a highly expressive class of predicates, namely constraints with polynomially bounded Waring rank, which notably includes puncturing.\r\n\r\nFrom a technical perspective, our work follows the general template of Couteau, Meyer, Passel\u00e8gue, and Riahinia (Eurocrypt'23), who constructed a pCPRF from group-based homomorphic secret-sharing but were limited to inner-product constraints in the constraint-hiding setting. Leveraging novel techniques for computing with distributed discrete logarithms (DDLog), we enable the non-interactive authentication of powers of linear combinations of shares of some value. This, in turn, allows us to express constraints with polynomially bounded Waring rank. \r\n\r\nOur construction is single-key, selectively secure, and supports an exponential-size domain.",

    "abstract": "We show a generic compiler from KEM to (Universally Composable) PAKE in the Random Oracle Model (ROM) and without requiring an Ideal Cipher.  The compiler is akin to Encrypted Key Exchange (EKE) by Bellovin-Merritt, but following the work of McQuoid et al. it uses only a 2-round Feistel to password-encrypt a KEM public key. The resulting PAKE incurs only insignificant cost overhead over the underlying KEM, and it is a secure UC PAKE if KEM is secure and key-anonymous under the Plaintext-Checking Attack (PCA).\r\n\r\nSeveral KEM-to-PAKE compilers were shown recently, secure under the OW-PCA and ANO-PCA assumptions on KEM, but all used an Ideal Cipher in addition to ROM.  While there are techniques for emulating ROM against quantum attackers, it is currently unknown how to extend many of such techniques to the Ideal Cipher Model.  Consequently, doing without the Ideal Cipher in protocol design makes the resulting construction a more plausible candidate for post-quantum secure PAKE if instantiated with post-quantum PCA-secure and anonymous KEM, such as the ML-KEM standard itself.\r\n\r\nOur construction and proofs build on many of the ideas underlying the KEM-to-PAKE compiler using 2-round Feistel given by McQuoid et al, but our protocol is more efficient and our proofs address limitations in the analysis therein.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a constant-round actively secure two-party computation protocol with small communication based on the ring learning with errors (RLWE) assumption with key-dependent message security. Our result builds on the recent BitGC protocol by Liu, Wang, Yang, and Yu (Eurocrypt 2025) with communication of one bit per gate for semi-honest security. First, we achieve a different manner of distributed garbling, where the global correlation is secret-shared among the two parties. The garbler always and only holds the garbled labels corresponding to the wire values when all inputs are zero, while the evaluator holds the labels corresponding to the real evaluation.  In the second phase, we run an authentication protocol that requires some extra communication, which allows two parties to check the correct computation of each gate by treating the ciphertext as commitments, now that the global key is distributed. For layered circuits, the extra communication for authentication is $o(1)$ bits per gate, resulting in total communication of $1+o(1)$ bits per gate. For generic circuits, the extra communication cost can be $1$ bit per gate in the worst case, and thus, the total communication cost would be 2 bits per gate.",

    "abstract": "Anamorphic encryption (AE), introduced by Persiano, Phan and Yung at Eurocrypt 22, allows to establish secure communication in scenarios where users might be forced to hand over their decryption keys to some hostile authority. Over the last few years, several work have improved our understanding of the primitive by proposing novel realizations, new security notions and studying inherent limitations. \r\nThis work makes progress, mainly, on this last line of research. \r\nWe show concrete realizations of so-called Anamorphic Resistant Encryption (ARE, for short). These are (public key) encryption schemes that, provably, cannot be turned anamorphic. \r\nWe also show that, under certain conditions, anamorphic encryption turns out to be equivalent to algorithm substitution attacks. This result allows to positively reinterpret our AREs as PKE schemes provably resistant to subversion attacks. To the best of our knowledge, these seem to be the first IND-CPA secure schemes that achieve subversion resistance without trust assumptions or non-black-box decomposition techniques. \r\nOur two AREs heavily rely, among other things, on a direct usage of extremely lossy functions: here the lossyness property is used in the constructions, rather than just in the proofs. The first construction is in the public parameters model and also requires iO. The second construction eliminates the need of both public parameters and iO, but is in the random oracle and relies on the novel concept of robust extremely lossy functions with group structure, a primitive that we define and (show how to) realize in this paper.",

    "abstract": "We study append-only set commitments with efficient updates and inclusion proofs, or cryptographic accumulators. In particular, we examine how often the inclusion proofs (or witnesses) for individual items must change as new items are added to the accumulated set. Using a compression argument, we show unconditionally that to accumulate a set of $n$ items, any construction with a succinct commitment ($O(\\lambda \\text{ polylog} \\ n)$ storage) must induce at least $\\omega(n)$ total witness updates as $n$ items are sequentially added. In a certain regime, we strengthen this bound to $\\Omega(n \\log n/\\log \\log n)$ total witness updates. These lower bounds hold not just in the worst case, but with overwhelming probability over a random choice of the accumulated set. Our results show that a close variant of the Merkle Mountain range, an elegant construction that has become popular in practice, is essentially optimal.",

    "abstract": "Can a sender commit to a long input without even reading all of it? Can a prover convince a verifier that an NP statement holds without  even reading the entire witness? Can a set of parties run a multiparty computation (MPC) protocol in the RAM model, without necessarily even reading their entire inputs? We show how to construct such \"doubly efficient\" schemes in a setting where parties can preprocess their input offline, but subsequently they can engage in many different protocol executions over this input in sublinear online time. We do so in the plain model, without any common setup. Our constructions rely on doubly efficient private information retrieval (DEPIR) as a building block and can be instantiated based on Ring LWE. \r\n\r\nIn more detail, we begin by constructing doubly efficient (interactive) commitments, where the sender preprocesses the input offline, and can later commit to this input to arbitrary  receivers in sublinear online time. Moreover, the sender  can open individual bits of the committed input in sublinear time.  We then use these commitments to implement doubly succinct (interactive) arguments, where the prover preprocesses the statement/witness offline, and can subsequently run many proof protocols to convince arbitrary verifiers of the statement's validity in sublinear online time. Furthermore, we augment these to get a doubly efficient \"commit, prove and locally open\" protocol, where the prover can commit to a long preprocessed input, prove that it satisfies some global property, and locally open individual bits, all in sublinear time. Finally, we leverage these tools to construct a RAM-MPC with malicious security in the plain model. Each party individually preprocesses its input offline, and can then run arbitrary MPC executions over this input with arbitrary other parties. The online run-time of each MPC execution is only proportional to the RAM run-time of the underlying program, that can be sublinear in the input size.",

    "abstract": "Indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) has seen remarkable theoretical progress, yet it remains impractical due to its high complexity and inefficiency. A common bottleneck in recent iO schemes is the reliance on bootstrapping techniques from functional encryption (FE) into iO, which requires recursively invoking the FE encryption algorithm for each input bit\u2014creating a significant barrier to practical iO schemes.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose diamond iO, a new lattice-based iO construction that replaces the costly recursive encryption process with lightweight matrix operations. Our construction is proven secure under the learning with errors (LWE) and evasive LWE assumptions, as well as our new assumption\u2014all-product LWE\u2014in the pseudorandom oracle model. By leveraging the FE scheme for pseudorandom functionalities introduced by Agrawal et al. (ePrint\u201924) in a non-black-box manner, we remove the reliance on prior FE-to-iO bootstrapping techniques and thereby significantly reduce complexity. A remaining challenge is to reduce our new assumption to standard assumptions such as LWE, further advancing the goal of a practical and sound iO construction.",

    "abstract": "Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) is a type of key exchange protocols secure against man-in-the-middle adversaries, in the setting where the two parties only agree upon a low-entropy \"password\" in advance. The first and arguably most well-studied PAKE protocol is Encrypted Key Exchange (EKE) (Bellovin and Marritt, 1992), and the standard security notion for PAKE is in the Universal Composability (UC) framework (Canetti et al., 2005). While the UC-security of EKE has been \"folklore\" knowledge for many years, a satisfactory formal proof has long been elusive.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we present a UC-security proof for the most common instantiation of EKE, which is based on hashed Diffie\u2013Hellman. Our proof is in the random oracle + ideal cipher models, and under the computational Diffie\u2013Hellman assumption. We thoroughly discuss the UC-security definition for PAKE, subtleties and pitfalls in the security proof, how to write a UC proof, and flaws in existing works; along the way we also present some philosophical discussions on security definitions and security proofs in general. In this way, we hope to draw attention to several understudied, underexplained or underappreciated aspects of the UC-security of EKE.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial can be viewed as a simplified version of the recent work by Januzelli, Roy and Xu (2025); however, we completely rewrite most of the materials there to make them much more approachable to beginners who have just learned the UC framework.",

    "abstract": "Cryptographic proof systems enable a verifier to be convinced of of a computation's correctness  without re-executing it; common efficiency requirements include both succinct proofs and fast verification.\r\nIn this work we put forth the general study of cryptographic proof systems with sublinear proving time (after a preprocessing).\r\nPrior work has achieved sublinear proving only for limited computational settings (e.g., vector commitments and lookup arguments), relying on specific assumptions or through non-black-box use of cryptographic primitives. In  this work we lift many of these limitations through the systematic study of a specific object: polynomial commitments (PC) with sublinear proving time, a choice motivated by the crucial role that PC play in the design of efficient cryptographic schemes.  \r\nOur main result is a simple construction of a PC with sublinear prover based on any vector commitment scheme (VC) and any preprocessing technique for fast polynomial evaluation. We prove that this PC satisfies evaluation binding, which is the standard security notion for PC, and show how to expand our construction to achieve the stronger notion of knowledge soundness (extractability). \r\nThe first application of our result is a construction of \"index-efficient\" SNARKs  meaning that the prover is  sublinear, after preprocessing, in the size of the index (i.e., the NP-relation describing the proven statement).  Our main technical contribution is a method to transform a class of standard Polynomial Interactive Oracle Proofs (PIOPs) into index-efficient PIOPs. Our construction of index-efficient SNARKs makes black-box use of such index-efficient PIOPs and a PC with sublinear prover. \r\nAs a corollary, this yields the first lookup argument for unstructured tables in which the prover is sublinear in the size of the table, while making only black-box use of a VC and thus allowing instantiations from generic assumptions such as collision-resistant hash functions. Prior lookup arguments with sublinear provers were only known with non-black-box use of cryptographic primitives, or from pairings. Finally, our last application is a transformation that builds UC-secure SNARKs from simulation-extractable ones, with an approximately linear overhead in proving time (as opposed to quadratic in prior work).",

    "abstract": "We introduce DART, a fully anonymous, account-based payment system designed to address a comprehensive set of real-world considerations, including regulatory compliance, while achieving constant transaction size. DART supports multiple asset types, enabling users to issue on-chain assets such as tokenized real-world assets. It ensures confidentiality and anonymity by concealing asset types, transaction amounts, balances, and the identities of both senders and receivers, while guaranteeing unlinkability between transactions. Our design provides a mechanism for asset-specific auditing. Issuers can designate asset-specific auditors for the assets they issue, with the system preserving the privacy of the auditor\u2019s identity to achieve asset type privacy. Only the designated auditor is authorized to decrypt transactions related to their associated asset, and users efficiently prove the association between the (hidden) asset type and the (hidden) designated auditor in their transactions. \r\n\r\nDART supports non-interactive payments, allowing an online sender to submit a transaction even when the receiver is offline, while still incorporating a receiver affirmation mechanism that captures the real-world compliance consideration where the receiver must confirm (or deny) an incoming transaction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scheme of this kind in the permissionless setting. To accommodate all eventualities, DART also incorporates a reversibility mechanism, enabling senders to reclaim funds from pending transactions if the receiver\u2019s affirmation is not yet provided. Finally, it offers a privacy-preserving proof of balance (per asset type) mechanism. \r\n\r\nOur system achieves full anonymity while supporting concurrent incoming and outgoing transactions, resolving a common issue that plagues many account-based anonymous systems. We further demonstrate how our system supports multi-party transactions, allowing payment to multiple receivers in one transaction efficiently. We provide a full formal model in the Universal Composition (UC) setting, as well as a UC protocol realization.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a decentralized and leaderless sealed bid auction model for dynamic pricing of intents across blockchain networks. We leverage Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) to improve pricing while ensuring fairness and decentralization. By addressing the vulnerabilities of current centralized or static pricing mechanisms, our approach fosters transparent, secure, and competitive price discovery. We further enhance the confidentiality of intents through Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), and Trusted Execution Environments (TEE). Our novel methodology mitigates the risks of frontrunning and centralization while preserving the rapid settlement times essential to decentralized finance (DeFi).",

    "abstract": "The rational secret sharing problem (RSS) considers incentivizing rational parties to share their received information to reconstruct a correctly shared secret. Halpern and Teague (STOC'04) demonstrate that solving the RSS problem deterministically with explicitly bounded runtime is impossible, if parties prefer learning the secret than not learning, and they prefer fewer other parties to learn. \r\n\r\nTo overcome this impossibility result, we propose RSS with competition. We consider a slightly different yet sensible preference profile: Each party prefers to learn the secret early and prefers fewer parties learning before them. This preference profile changes the information-hiding dynamics among parties in prior works: First, those who have learned the secret are indifferent towards or even prefer informing others later; second, the competition to learn the secret earlier among different access groups in the access structure facilitates information sharing inside an access group. As a result, we are able to construct the first deterministic RSS algorithm that terminates in at most two rounds. Additionally, our construction does not employ any cryptographic machinery (being fully game-theoretic and using the underlying secret-sharing scheme as a black-box) nor requires the knowledge of the parties' exact utility function. Furthermore, we consider general access structures.",

    "abstract": "$\\textit{Linkable ring signatures}$ (LRS) allow a user to sign anonymously on behalf of a ring, while maintaining linkability\u2014two signatures from the same signer are publicly identified, i.e., linked. This linkability makes LRS suitable to prevent double-voting in classical, $\\textit{plurality}$ voting protocols\u2014each voter casts one vote and the candidate with the most votes wins the election. \r\n\r\n    Several voting scenarios rely on (generalized) rules rather than plurality. For example, in $\\textit{ranked voting}$, voters submit a ranking of the candidates, and the outcome is a function of these rankings. Such generalized voting rules are common in social choice theory, and have recently found their way into blockchain governance, e.g., for prioritizing (voting on) proposed (candidate)  projects. However, unlike plurality voting, using LRS for voters to sign their votes (rankings) does not guarantee vote privacy as one can observe the rankings of each individual voter, which, depending on the scoring rule, is more information than what the outcome of the election offers. \r\n\r\nWe introduce $k$-$\\textit{linkable ring signatures}$ ($k$-LRS) as a primitive for simultaneously achieving anonymity and privacy in generalized voting. A $k$-LRS scheme has the following properties: \r\n   ($k$-)$\\textit{Anonymity}$: a user can sign anonymously (on behalf of the ring) up to $k$ times, so that even an unbounded adversary cannot link his signatures.\r\n   ($k$-)$\\textit{Linkability}$: If any signer signs more than $k$ times, all his signatures are publicly linked $\\textit{(individual $k$-linkability)}$; and, any set of $c$ signers cannot generate more than $k\\cdot c$ unlinked signatures $\\textit{(collective $k$-linkability)}$.\r\n\r\n    We provide two constructions of $k$-LRS: one is from the DDH, and the other is from SIS (hence post-quantum). Finally, we show how $k$-LRS can be applied to a broad range of voting rules, including $\\textit{score voting}$, $\\textit{multi-voting}$, and $\\textit{Borda}$. Our protocols are non-interactive voting\u2014each voter just posts a message on a bulletin board\u2014which highlights the potential of $k$-LRS in blockchain-governance scenarios.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a general template for building garbled circuits with low communication, under the decisional composite residuosity (DCR) assumption. For the case of layered Boolean circuits, we can garble a circuit of size $s$ with communication proportional to $O(s/\\log\\log s)$ bits, plus an additive factor that is polynomial in the security parameter. For layered arithmetic circuits with $B$-bounded integer computation, we obtain a similar result: the garbled arithmetic circuit has size $O(s/\\log\\log s) \\cdot (\\lambda + \\log B)$ bits, where $\\lambda$ is the security parameter. These are the first constructions of general-purpose, garbled circuits with sublinear size, without relying on heavy tools like indistinguishability obfuscation or attribute-based and fully homomorphic encryption.\r\n\r\nTo achieve these results, our main technical tool is a new construction of a form of homomorphic secret sharing where some of the inputs are semi-private, that is, known to one of the evaluating parties. Through a new relinearisation technique that allows performing arbitrary additions and multiplications on semi-private shares, we build such an HSS scheme that supports evaluating any function of the form $C(x) \\cdot C'(y)$, where $C$ is any polynomially-sized circuit applied to the semi-private input $y$, and $C'$ is a restricted-multiplication (or, NC1) circuit applied to the private input $x$. This significantly broadens the expressiveness of prior known HSS constructions.",

In this scenario, the best known protocol due to Elsheimy, Loss, and Papamanthou (ASIACRYPT `24) achieves a round complexity of $(1+\\epsilon)\\cdot f$ for some constant $0<\\epsilon<1$. We begin by introducing an improvement to the Elsheimy et al. approach which can be used to obtain the first polynomial-time early stopping agreement protocols in the $t<n/2$ corruption regime which achieve a complexity of $f+O(\\sqrt{f})$. We then instantiate our generic framework with refined components to obtain a very concretely efficient protocol with a round complexity of only $f + 6\\lceil\\sqrt{f}\\rceil+6$ and polynomial communication complexity. Finally, we show that it is possible to come within one round of the optimal round complexity by presenting a broadcast protocol based on the exponential information gathering approach, which achieves a round complexity of $\\min\\{f + 3, t + 1\\}$, albeit with exponential communication complexity.",

    "abstract": "Folding is a technique for building efficient succinct proof systems. Many existing folding protocols rely on the discrete-log based Pedersen commitment scheme, and are therefore not post-quantum secure and require a large (256-bit) field. Recently, Boneh and Chen constructed LatticeFold, a folding protocol using lattice-based commitments which is plausibly post-quantum secure and can operate with small (64-bit) fields. For knowledge soundness, LatticeFold requires the prover to provide a range proof on all the input witnesses using bit-decomposition, and this slows down the prover. In this work we present LatticeFold+, a very different lattice-based folding protocol that improves on LatticeFold in every respect: the prover is five to ten times faster, the verification circuit is simpler, and the folding proofs are shorter. To do so we develop two novel lattice techniques. First, we develop a new purely algebraic range proof which is much more efficient than the one in LatticeFold, and may be of independent interest. We further shrink the proof using double commitments (commitments of commitments). Second, we show how to fold statements about double commitments using a new sumcheck-based transformation.",

    "abstract": "In block ciphers, the attacker should not be able to distinguish a block cipher from a random permutation, making the existence of a distinguisher important. Cryptanalysis of the reduced-round variants of block ciphers is also important in cryptographic design. AES is the most widely used block cipher, and currently, the best-known distinguisher for 5-round AES has a data and time complexity of $2^{29.95}$ with a success probability of 55\\%. In this paper, we propose the fully active exchanged boomerang and multiple exchanged boomerang distinguishers for 5-round AES, based on the retracing boomerang key-recovery attack. The fully active exchanged boomerang distinguisher utilizes the probability that either each byte of the diagonal of the returned plaintext pair is fully active, or the diagonal is inactive for all diagonals. This probability is very high, but we enhance it using the friends pair technique to distinguish a block cipher from a random permutation. The multiple exchanged boomerang distinguisher utilizes the fact that there are three trails where the probability of one diagonal of the returned plaintext pair being inactive is higher than the random probability, and one trail where it is equal to the random probability. This 5-round distinguisher has a complexity of $2^{27.08}$ and a success probability of 82\\%, which represents a new best-known result for the secret-key distinguisher on 5-round AES.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of quantum computing has ushered in a new era of post-quantum cryptography, urgently demanding quantum-resistant digital signatures to secure modern communications and transactions. Among NIST-standardized candidates, Falcon\u2014a compact lattice-based signature scheme\u2014stands out for its suitability in size-sensitive applications. In this paper, we present cuFalcon, a high-throughput GPU implementation of Falcon that addresses its computational bottlenecks through adaptive parallel strategies.  At the operational level, we optimize Falcon key components for GPU architectures through memory-efficient FFT, adaptive parallel ffSampling, and a compact computation mode. For signature-level optimization, we implement three versions of cuFalcon: the raw key version, the expanded key version, and the balanced version, which achieves a trade-off between efficiency and memory usage. Additionally, we design batch processing, streaming mechanisms, and memory pooling to handle multiple signature tasks efficiently. Ultimately, performance evaluations show significant improvements, with the raw key version achieving 172k signatures per second and the expanded key version reaching 201k.  Compared to the raw key version, the balanced version achieves a 7% improvement in throughput, while compared to the expanded key version, it reduces memory usage by 70%. Furthermore, our raw key version implementation outperforms the reference implementation by 36.75 $\\times$ and achieves a 2.94$\\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art GPU implementation.",

    "abstract": "We study the round-complexity of secure multi-party computation (MPC) in the post-quantum regime where honest parties and communication channels are classical but the adversary can be a quantum machine. Our focus is on the $\\mathit{fully}$ black-box setting where both the construction as well as the security reduction are black-box in nature. In this context, Chia, Chung, Liu, and Yamakawa [FOCS'22] demonstrated the infeasibility of achieving standard simulation-based security within constant rounds, unless $\\mathbf{NP} \\subseteq \\mathbf{BQP}$. This outcome leaves crucial feasibility questions unresolved. Specifically, it remains unknown whether black-box constructions are achievable within polynomial rounds; additionally, the existence of constant-round constructions with respect to $\\epsilon$-$\\mathit{simulation}$, a relaxed yet useful alternative to the standard simulation notion, remains unestablished. \r\n\r\nThis work provides positive answers to the aforementioned questions. We introduce the first black-box construction for post-quantum MPC in polynomial rounds, from the minimal assumption of post-quantum semi-honest oblivious transfers. In the two-party scenario, our construction requires only $\\omega(1)$ rounds. These results have already found application in the oracle separation between classical-communication quantum MPC and $\\mathbf{P} = \\mathbf{NP}$ in the recent work of Kretschmer, Qian, and Tal [STOC'25].\r\n\r\nAs for $\\epsilon$-simulation, Chia, Chung, Liang, and Yamakawa [CRYPTO'22] resolved the issue for the two-party setting, leaving the general multi-party setting as an open question. We complete the picture by presenting the first black-box and constant-round construction in the multi-party setting. Our construction can be instantiated using various standard post-quantum primitives including lossy public-key encryption, linearly homomorphic public-key encryption, or dense cryptosystems.\r\n\r\nEn route, we obtain a black-box and constant-round post-quantum commitment that achieves a weaker version of the standard 1-many non-malleability, from the minimal assumption of post-quantum one-way functions. Besides its utility in our post-quantum MPC construction, this commitment scheme also reduces the assumption used in the lower bound of quantum parallel repetition recently established by Bostanci, Qian, Spooner, and Yuen [STOC'24]. We anticipate that it will find more applications in the future.",

Input $x$ is called a $\\textit{streaming}$ input if it is only available on-the-fly as part of an ongoing data generation/streaming process, and not available at once. We also propose a new notion of zero-knowledge features for IVsC that guarantees the proof can be incrementally verified w.r.t.~an encrypted digest, where the proof and digest hide the full data stream. We design zero-knowledge IVsC from a wide variety of standard falsifiable assumptions (such as decision-linear/sub-exponential DDH/LWE).\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also introduce a new notion of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, that we call $\\textit{step-by-step}$ zero-knowledge protocols. Such protocols have strong zero-knowledge guarantees, wherein the prover's entire internal memory is simulatable at any point during proof generation. That is, unlike standard zero-knowledge proofs, where only the final proof is simulatable, we can also simulate prover's state at every step of the computation. Such proof systems will be useful in settings where an adversary could corrupt an honest prover even before it generates the full proof. We show that a zero-knowledge IVsC system can be used (almost) as a black-box to design step-by-step zero-knowledge proof systems, therefore secure under standard assumptions.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a high-performance architecture for accelerating Multi-Scalar Multiplication (MSM) on ASIC platforms, targeting cryptographic applications with high throughput demands. Unlike prior MSM accelerators that focus solely on efficient processing elements (PEs), our chiplet-based design optimally balances area, power, and computational throughput. We identify a mixed window configuration of 12- and 13-bit windows that enables an efficient multi-PE integration of 10 PEs per chiplet. Our single-PE design achieves a 1.37x speedup and 1.3x area reduction over prior works, while the multi-PE chiplet design improves the area-time product by 2.2x, offering scalability, lower production costs, and higher manufacturing yields.",

    "abstract": "Current adaptively secure identity-based encryption (IBE) constructions from lattices are unable to achieve a good balance among the master public key size, secret key size, modulus and reduction loss. All existing lattice-based IBE schemes share a common restriction: the modulus is quadratic in the trapdoor norm.\r\nIn this work, we remove this restriction and present a new adaptively secure IBE scheme from lattices in the standard model, which improves the state-of-the-art construction proposed by Abla et al. (TCC 2021) and achieves asymptotically better efficiency. More precisely, we achieve the asymptotically minimal number of public vectors among all the existing schemes, along with a significantly smaller modulus compared to the scheme by Abla et al. (TCC 2021). Furthermore, our scheme enjoys the smallest Gaussian width of the secret key among all existing schemes and has the same tightness as Abla et al.'s scheme.\r\nWe propose a novel cross-multiplication design for our IBE scheme, along with several novel tools and techniques, including: (a) a homomorphic computation algorithm that outputs BGG+-style encoding with two distinct-norm trapdoors; (b) a sampling algorithm with hybrid Gaussian outputs; and (c) a partial rerandomization algorithm. These new tools and techniques are general and could find rich applications in lattice-based cryptography.",

    "abstract": "Garbled Circuit (GC) is a fundamental tool in cryptography, especially in secure multiparty computation.  Most garbling schemes follow a gate-by-gate paradigm.  The communication cost is proportional to the circuit size times the security parameter $\\lambda$.\r\n\r\nRecently, Heath, Kolesnikov and Ng (Eurocrypt 2024) partially transcend the circuit size barrier by considering large gates.  To garble an arbitrary $n$-input $m$-output gate, their scheme requires $O(nm\\lambda) + 2^nm$ bits of communication.  The security relies on circular correlation robust hash functions (CCRH).\r\n\r\nWe further improve the communication cost to $O(n \\lambda_{\\sf DCR} + m\\lambda)$, removing the exponential term.  The computation cost is $O(2^n (\\lambda_{\\sf DCR})^2)$, dominated by $O(2^nn)$ exponentiations. Our construction is built upon recent progress in DCR-based Homomorphic Secret Sharing (HSS), so it additionally relies on the decisional composite residuosity (DCR) assumption.\r\n\r\nAs an intermediate step, we construct programmable distributed point functions with decomposable keys, relying on the DCR assumption.

    "abstract": "To counteract side-channel attacks, a masking scheme splits each intermediate variable into $n$ shares and transforms each elementary operation (e.g., field addition and multiplication) to the masked correspondence called gadget, such that intrinsic noise in the leakages renders secret recovery infeasible in practice. A simple and efficient security notion is the probing model ensuring that any $n-1$ shares are independently distributed from the secret input. One requirement of the probing model is the noise in the leakages should increase with the number of shares, largely restricting the side-channel security in the low-noise scenario. Another security notion for masking, called the random probing model, allows each variable to leak with a probability $p$. While this model reflects the physical reality of side channels much better, it brings significant overhead. At Crypto 2018, Ananth et al. proposed a modular approach that can provide random probing security for any security level by expanding small base gadgets with $n$ share recursively, such that the tolerable leakage probability $p$ decreases with $n$ while the security increases exponentially with the recursion depth of expansion. Then, Bela\u00efd et al. provided a formal security definition called Random Probing Expandability (RPE) and an explicit framework using the modular approach to construct masking schemes at Crypto 2020.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we investigate how to tighten the RPE definition via allowing the dependent failure probabilities of multiple inputs, which results in a new definition called related RPE. It can be directly used for the expansion of multiplication gates and reduce the complexity of the base multiplication gadget from $\\mathcal{O}(n^2\\log n)$ proposed at Asiacrypt 2021 to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ and maintain the same security level. Furthermore, we describe a method to expand any gates (rather than only multiplication) with the related RPE gadgets.\r\nBesides, we denote another new RPE definition called Multiple inputs RPE used for the expansion of multiple-input gates composed with any gates. Utilizing these methods, we reduce the complexity of 3-share circuit compiler to $\\mathcal{O}(|C|\\cdot\\kappa^{3.2})$, where $|C|$ is the size of the unprotected circuit and the protection failure probability of the global circuit is $2^{-\\kappa}$. In comparison, the complexity of the state-of-the-art work, proposed at Eurocrypt 2021, is $\\mathcal{O}(|C|\\cdot\\kappa^{3.9})$ for the same value of $n$. Additionally, we provide the construction of a 5-share circuit compiler with a complexity $\\mathcal{O}(|C|\\cdot\\kappa^{2.8})$.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we construct distortion-free and unforgeable watermarks for language models and generative agents. The watermarked output cannot be forged by a adversary nor removed by the adversary without significantly degrading model output quality. That is, the watermarked output is distortion-free: the watermarking algorithm does not noticeably change the quality of the model output and without the public detection key, no efficient adversary can distinguish output that is watermarked from outputs which are not. The core of the watermarking schemes involve embedding a message and publicly-verifiable digital signature in the generated model output. The message and signature can be extracted during the detection phase and verified by any authorized entity that has a public key. We show that, assuming the standard cryptographic assumption of one-way functions, we can construct distortion-free and unforgeable watermark schemes. Our framework relies on analyzing the inaccessible entropy of the watermarking schemes based on computational entropy notions derived from the existence of one-way functions.",

    "abstract": "Floating-point arithmetic plays a central role in computer science and is used in various domains where precision and computational scale are essential. One notable application is in machine learning, where Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) can play a crucial role in safeguarding user privacy. In this paper, we focus on TFHE and develop novel homomorphic operators designed to enable the construction of precise and adaptable homomorphic floating-point operations. Integrating floating-point arithmetic within the context of FHE is particularly challenging due to constraints such as small message space and the lack of information during computation. Despite these challenges, we were able to determine parameters for common precisions (e.g., 32-bit, 64-bit) and achieve remarkable computational speeds, with 32-bit floating-point additions completing in 2.5 seconds and multiplications in approximately 1 second in a multi-threaded environment. These metrics provide empirical evidence of the efficiency and practicality of our proposed methods, which significantly outperform previous efforts. Our results demonstrate a significant advancement in the practical application of FHE, making it more viable for real-world scenarios and bridging the gap between theoretical encryption techniques and practical usability.",

    "abstract": "Publicly identifiable abort is a critical feature for ensuring accountability in outsourced computations using secure multiparty computation (MPC). Despite its importance, no prior work has specifically addressed identifiable abort in the context of outsourced computations. In this paper, we present the first MPC protocol that supports publicly identifiable abort with minimal overhead for external clients. Our approach minimizes client-side computation by requiring only a few pseudorandom function evaluations per input. On the server side, the verification process involves lightweight linear function evaluations using homomorphic encryption. This results in verification times of a few nanoseconds per operation for servers, with client overhead being approximately two orders of magnitude lower. Additionally, the publicly verifiable nature of our protocol reduces client input/output costs compared to SPDZ-based protocols, on which we base our protocol. For example, in secure aggregation use cases, our protocol achieves over twice the efficiency during the offline phase and up to an 18 % speedup in the online phase, significantly outperforming SPDZ.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, the introduction of advanced cryptographic protocols operating on large finite fields $\\mathbb{F}_q$ has raised the need for efficient cryptographic primitives in this setting, commonly referred to as Arithmetization-Oriented (AO). The cryptanalysis of AO hash functions is essentially done through the study of the CICO problem on the underlying permutation. Two recent works at Crypto 2024 and Asiacrypt 2024 managed to solve the CICO problem much more efficiently than traditional Gr\u00f6bner basis methods, using respectively advanced Gr\u00f6bner basis techniques and resultants.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose an attack framework based on resultants that applies to a wide range of AO permutations and improves significantly upon these two recent works. Our improvements mainly come from an efficient reduction procedure that we propose and rigorously analyze, taking advantage of fast multivariate multiplication. We present the most efficient attacks on Griffin, Arion, Anemoi, and Rescue. We show that most variants of Griffin, Arion and Anemoi fail to reach the claimed security level. For the first time, we successfully break a parameter set of Rescue, namely its $512$-bit security variant. The presented theory and complexity estimates are backed up with experimental attacks. Notably, we practically find CICO solutions for $8$ out of $10$ rounds of Griffin, $11$ out of $20$ rounds of Anemoi,  $6$ out of $18$ rounds of Rescue, improving by respectively $1$, $3$ and $1$ rounds on the previous best practical attacks.",

    "abstract": "Secure key leasing (SKL) is an advanced encryption functionality that allows a secret key holder to generate a quantum decryption key and securely lease it to a user. Once the user returns the quantum decryption key (or provides a classical certificate confirming its deletion), they lose their decryption capability. Previous works on public key encryption with SKL (PKE-SKL) have only considered the single-key security model, where the adversary receives at most one quantum decryption key. However, this model does not accurately reflect real-world applications of PKE-SKL. To address this limitation, we introduce collusion-resistant security for PKE-SKL (denoted as PKE-CR-SKL). In this model, the adversary can adaptively obtain multiple quantum decryption keys and access a verification oracle which validates the correctness of queried quantum decryption keys. Importantly, the size of the public key and ciphertexts must remain independent of the total number of generated quantum decryption keys. We present the following constructions:\r\n\r\n- A PKE-CR-SKL scheme based on the learning with errors (LWE) assumption.\r\n\r\n- An attribute-based encryption scheme with collusion-resistant SKL (ABE-CR-SKL), also based on the LWE assumption.\r\n\r\n- An ABE-CR-SKL scheme with classical certificates, relying on multi-input ABE with polynomial arity.",

    "abstract": "Recently, there is a growing need for SNARKs to operate over a broader range of algebraic structures, and one important structure is Galois ring. We present transparent SNARK schemes over arbitrary Galois rings. Compared with Rinocchio scheme in Ganesh et al.

Using this expander code, we then extend the Brakedown commitment scheme in Golovnev et al. (CRYPTO 2023) to Galois rings. By combining the Libra framework in Xie et al. (CRYPTO 2019), we present a transparent SNARK for log-space uniform circuits over Galois rings, achieving $O(n)$ prover time, $O(\\sqrt{n})$ proof size, and $O(\\sqrt{n})$ verifier time. And by combining HyperPlonk in Chen et al.

    "abstract": "The adaptive security of threshold signatures considers an adversary that adaptively corrupts users to learn their secret key shares and states. Crites, Komlo, and Maller (Crypto 2023) proposed Sparkle, the first threshold signature scheme in the pairing-free discrete-log setting to be proved adaptively secure. However, its proof of full adaptive security requires the algebraic group model (AGM) and is based on an interactive assumption. Bacho, Loss, Tessaro, Wagner, and Zhu (Eurocrypt 2024) proposed Twinkle, whose full adaptive security can be based on the standard DDH assumption only.\r\n\r\nWe propose Dazzle and Dazzle-T, adaptively secure threshold signature schemes based on DDH without the AGM, the same assumption and model as Twinkle. Our schemes improve upon Twinkle in signature size, round complexity, and/or security tightness. In particular, Dazzle and Dazzle-T both have signatures that are shorter than Twinkle by one group element. Regarding the round complexity and tightness, Twinkle is three-round and non-tight. Our Dazzle is two-round and has the same security loss as Twinkle, while Dazzle-T is three-round and fully tight.\r\n\r\nWe achieve our improvements by optimizing the underlying single-party signature scheme and showing that the single-party scheme can be transformed to a threshold scheme by a simpler transformation than that of Twinkle.",

    "abstract": "Software watermarking for cryptographic functionalities enables embedding an arbitrary message (a mark) into a cryptographic function. An extraction algorithm, when provided with a (potentially unauthorized) circuit, retrieves either the embedded mark or a special symbol unmarked indicating the absence of a mark. It is difficult to modify or remove the embedded mark without destroying the functionality of a marked function. Previous works have primarily employed black-box extraction techniques, where the extraction algorithm requires only input-output access to the circuit rather than its internal descriptions (white-box extraction). Zhandry (CRYPTO 2021) identified several challenges in watermarking public-key encryption (PKE) with black-box extraction and introduced the notion of privacy for white-box watermarking against classical adversaries. Kitagawa and Nishimaki (Journal of Cryptology 37(3)) extended watermarking techniques to pseudorandom functions (PRFs) and PKE in the presence of quantum adversaries, enabling extraction from pirate quantum circuits but failing to achieve privacy.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we investigate white-box watermarking for digital signatures secure against quantum adversaries. Our constructions enable the extraction of embedded marks from the description of a pirate quantum circuit that produces valid signatures while ensuring that black-box access to a marked signing function does not reveal information about the embedded mark. We define and construct white-box watermarking signatures that are secure against quantum adversaries, leveraging the leaning with errors (LWE) assumption and quantum fully homomorphic encryption. Furthermore, we highlight that privacy concerns are even more critical in the context of signatures than in PKE. We also present a compelling practical application of white-box watermarking signatures.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we explore the concept of universal copy protection for signatures. We define universal copy protection as a mechanism that transforms any quantumly secure signature scheme into a copy-protected variant without altering the verification key or verification algorithm. This approach is preferable to developing specific copy-protected signature schemes, as it allows existing schemes to be secured without modifying their published verification keys. We demonstrate that universal copy protection for all quantum secure signatures is impossible by leveraging our white-box watermarking signatures secure against quantum adversaries.",

    "abstract": "The study of attack algorithms for the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem is crucial for the cryptanalysis of LWE-based cryptosystems. The BKW algorithm has gained significant attention as an important combinatorial attack for solving LWE. However, its exponential time and memory requirements severely limit its practical applications, even with medium-sized parameters. In this paper, we present a memory-efficient BKW algorithm for LWE, which extends Bogos's work [Asiacrypt'16] on the Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem. While their work improved efficiency, it overlooked the high memory demands of the BKW algorithm. We address this with two key improvements. First, we propose an efficient reduction technique for low-memory regimes, \\(c\\)-sum-PCS-reduce, which combines the \\(c\\)-sum technique with Parallel Collision Search (PCS) to achieve a better time-memory trade-off. Second, we present an improved memory-optimized finite automaton for our optimized BKW algorithm by incorporating several efficient memory-saving reduction techniques and pruning potential high-memory paths. Our algorithm, using graphs as a meta tool, can automatically identify the optimal reduction path within the graph, aiming to reduce both time and memory complexities. Compared to the state-of-the-art coded-BKW in the lattice-estimator, our algorithm achieves time complexity improvements ranging from \\(2^{3.3}\\) to \\(2^{26.2}\\). Furthermore, memory complexity is improved, with reductions ranging from \\(2^{9.7}\\) to \\(2^{71.3}\\).",

    "abstract": "Garbling schemes are a fundamental cryptographic tool for enabling private computations and ensuring that nothing leaks beyond the output. As a widely studied primitive, significant efforts have been made to reduce their size. Until recently, all such schemes followed the Lindell and Pinkas paradigm for Boolean circuits (JoC 2009), where each gate is represented as a set of ciphertexts computed using only symmetric-key primitives. However, this approach is inherently limited to \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udf06) bits per gate, where \ud835\udf06 is the security parameter. Recently, it has been shown that achieving smaller garbled circuit size is possible under stronger assumptions, such as variants of Learning with Errors (LWE) or Indistinguishability Obfuscation (iO). In addition to requiring high-end cryptography, none of these constructions is black-box in the underlying cryptographic primitives, a key advantage of prior work. In this paper, we\r\npresent the first approach to garbling Boolean circuits that makes a black-box use of a group and uses \ud835\udc5c(\ud835\udf06) bits per gate.\r\n\r\nBuilding on a novel application of the Reverse Multiplication-Friendly Embeddings (RMFE) paradigm (Cascudo et al., CRYPTO 2018), We introduce a new packing mechanism for garbling schemes, that packs boolean values into integers and leverage techniques for arithmetic garbling over integer rings. Our results introduce two new succinct schemes that achieve improved rates by a factor of\u221a\ufe01 log \ud835\udf06, retaining the black-box usage. (1) Our first scheme is proven in the Generic Group model (GGM) for circuits with \u03a9(\u221a\ufe01 log \ud835\udf06) width, obtaining a garbled circuit size of \ud835\udf06 \u00b7 |C|/\u221a\ufe01 log(\ud835\udf06). (2) Our second scheme is proven in the plain model under the Power-DDH assumption, attaining a garbled circuit size of \ud835\udf06 \u00b7 (|C|/\u221a\ufe01 log(\ud835\udf06) + poly(\ud835\udf06) \u00b7 depth(C), but is restricted to layered circuits. Our schemes are the first to achieve sublinear (in \ud835\udf06) cost per gate under assumptions that do not imply fully homomorphic encryption; in addition, our scheme is also the first to achieve this while making a black-box use of cryptography.",

    "abstract": "Secure computation enables mutually distrusting parties to jointly compute a function on their secret inputs, while revealing nothing beyond the function output. A long-running challenge is understanding the required communication complexity of such protocols \u2013 in particular, when communication can be sublinear in the circuit representation size of the desired function. While several techniques have demonstrated the viability of sublinear secure computation in the two-party setting, known methods for the corresponding multi-party setting rely either on fully homomorphic encryption, non-standard hardness assumptions, or are limited to a small number of parties. In this work, we expand the study of multi-party sublinear secure computation by demonstrating sublinear-communication 10-party computation from various combinations of standard hardness assumptions. In particular, our contributions show:\r\n\r\n\u2013 8-party homomorphic secret sharing under the hardness of (DDH or DCR), the superpolynomial hardness of LPN, and the existence of constant-depth pseudorandom generators;\r\n\u2013 A general framework for achieving (N + M )-party sublinear secure computation using M-party homomorphic secret sharing for NC1 and correlated symmetric PIR.\r\n\r\nTogether, our constructions imply the existence of a 10-party MPC protocol with sublinear computation. At the core of our techniques lies a novel series of computational approaches based on homomorphic secret sharing.",

    "abstract": "Masking is a common countermeasure against side-channel attacks that encodes secrets into multiple shares, each of which may be subject to leakage. A key question is under what leakage conditions, and to what extent, does increasing the number of shares actually improve the security of these secrets. Although this question has been studied extensively in low-SNR regimes, scenarios where the adversary obtains substantial information\u2014such as on low-noise processors or through static power analysis\u2014have remained underexplored.\r\nIn this paper, we address this gap by deriving necessary and sufficient noise requirements for masking security in both standalone encodings and linear gadgets. We introduce a decomposition technique that reduces the relationship between an extended-field variable and its leakage into subproblems involving linear combinations of the variable\u2019s bits. By working within binary subfields, we derive optimal bounds and then lift these results back to the extended field.\r\nBeyond binary fields, we also present a broader framework for analyzing masking security in other structures, including prime fields. As an application, we prove a conjecture by Dziembowski et al. (TCC 2016), which states that for an additive group \\(\\mathbb{G}\\) with its largest subgroup \\(\\mathbb{H}\\), a \\(\\delta\\)-noisy leakage satisfying \\(\\delta < 1 - \\tfrac{|\\mathbb{H}|}{|\\mathbb{G}|}\\) ensures that masking enhances the security of the secret.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we prove that the supersingular isogeny problem (Isogeny), endomorphism ring problem (EndRing) and maximal order problem (MaxOrder) are equivalent under probabilistic polynomial time reductions, unconditionally.\r\nIsogeny-based cryptography is founded on the presumed hardness of these problems, and their interconnection is at the heart of the design and analysis of cryptosystems like the SQIsign digital signature scheme. Previously known reductions relied on unproven assumptions such as the generalized Riemann hypothesis. In this work, we present unconditional reductions, and extend this network of equivalences to the problem of computing the lattice of all isogenies between two supersingular elliptic curves (HomModule).\r\nFor cryptographic applications, one requires computational problems to be hard on average for random instances. It is well-known that if Isogeny is hard (in the worst case), then it is hard for random instances. We extend this result by proving that if any of the above-mentionned classical problems is hard in the worst case, then all of them are hard on average. In particular, if there exist hard instances of Isogeny, then all of Isogeny, EndRing, MaxOrder and HomModule are hard on average.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain interoperability solutions allow users to hold and transfer assets among different chains, and in so doing reap the benefits of each chain. To fully reap the benefits of multi-chain financial operations, it is paramount to support interoperability and cross-chain transactions also on Layer-2 networks, in particular payment channel networks (PCNs). Nevertheless, existing works on Layer-2 interoperability solutions still involve on-chain events, which limits their scalability and throughput. In this work, we present X-Transfer, the first secure, scalable, and fully off-chain protocol that allows payments across different PCNs. We formalize and prove the security of X-Transfer against rational adversaries with a game theoretic analysis. In order to boost efficiency and scalability, X-Transfer also performs transaction aggregation to increase channel liquidity and transaction throughput while simultaneously minimizing payment routing fees.  Our empirical evaluation of X-Transfer shows that X-Transfer achieves at least twice as much throughput compared to the baseline of no transaction aggregation, confirming X-Transfer's efficiency.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel scheme for securely computing the AND operation, without requiring additional online randomness. Building on the work of Nikova et al., our construction extends security beyond the first order while ensuring a uniform output distribution and resilience against glitches up to a specified threshold. This result addresses a longstanding open problem in side-channel-resistant masking schemes.\r\nOur approach is based on a new method of share clustering, inspired by finite affine geometry, enabling simultaneous consideration of both security and uniformity. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this clustering-based framework can be applied to higher-order protection of ciphers like Ascon under a fully deterministic masking regime. \r\nBy eliminating the need for online randomness within the protected circuit, our work expands the practical scope of efficient and higher-order masking schemes for resource constraint applications.",

    "abstract": "We construct a novel code-based blind signature scheme, us- ing the Matrix Equivalence Digital Signature (MEDS) group action. The scheme is built using similar ideas to the Schnorr blind signature scheme and CSI-Otter, but uses additional public key and commitment informa- tion to overcome the difficulties that the MEDS group action faces: lack of module structure (present in Schnorr), lack of a quadratic twist (present in CSI-Otter), and non-commutativity of the acting group. We address security concerns related to public key validation, and prove the security of our protocol in the random oracle model, using the security framework of Kastner, Loss, and Xu, under a variant of the Inverse Matrix Code Equivalence problem and a mild heuristic assumption.",

    "abstract": "We show that the randomized TFHE bootstrapping technique of Bourse and Izabech\u00e9ne provides a form of sanitization which is error-simulatable. This means that the randomized bootstrap can be used not only for sanitization of ciphertexts (i.e. to hide the function that has been computed), but that it can also be used in server-assisted threshold decryption. Thus we extend the server-assisted threshold decryption method of Passel\u00e9gue and Stehl\u00e9 (ASIACRYPT '24) to FHE schemes which have small ciphertext modulus (such as TFHE). In addition the error-simulatable sanitization enables us to obtain FuncCPA security for TFHE essentially for free.",

    "abstract": "NIST has standardized ML-KEM and ML-DSA as replacements for pre-quantum key exchanges and digital signatures. Both schemes have already seen analysis with respect to side-channels, and first fully masked implementations of ML-DSA have been published. Previous attacks have focused on unprotected implementations or assumed only hiding countermeasures to be in-place. Thus, in contrast to ML-KEM, the threat of side-channel attacks for protected implementations of ML-DSA is mostly unclear.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we analyze the side-channel vulnerability of masked ML-DSA implementations. We first systematically assess the vulnerability of several potential points of attacks in different leakage models using information theory. Then, we explain how an adversary could launch first, second, and higher-order attacks using a recently presented framework for side-channel information in lattice-based schemes. In this context, we propose a filtering technique that allows the framework to solve for the secret key from a large number of hints; this had previously been prevented by numerical instabilities. We simulate the presented attacks and discuss the relation to the information-theoretic analysis.\r\n\r\nFinally, we carry out relevant attacks on a physical device, discuss recent masked implementations, and instantiate a countermeasure against the most threatening attacks. The countermeasure mitigates the attacks with the highest noise-tolerance while having very little overhead. The results on a physical device validate our simulations.",

    "abstract": "The secure management of private keys is a fundamental challenge, particularly for the general public, as losing these keys can result in irreversible asset loss. Traditional custodial approaches pose security risks, while decentralized secret sharing schemes offer a more resilient alternative by distributing trust among multiple parties. In this work, we extend an existing decentralized, verifiable, and extensible cryptographic key recovery scheme based on Shamir's secret sharing. We introduce a refresh phase that ensures proactive security, preventing long-term exposure of secret shares. Our approach explores three distinct methods for refreshing shares, analyzing and comparing their security guarantees and computational complexity. Additionally, we extend the protocol to support more complex access structures, with a particular focus on threshold access trees, enabling fine-grained control over key reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "The random probing model formalizes a leakage scenario where each wire in a circuit leaks with probability $p$. This model holds practical relevance due to its reduction to the noisy leakage model, which is widely regarded as the appropriate formalization for power and electromagnetic side-channel attacks. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present new techniques for designing efficient masking schemes that achieve tighter random probing security with lower complexity. First, we introduce the notion of \\emph{cardinal random probing composability} (Cardinal-RPC), offering a new trade-off between complexity and security for composing masking gadgets. Next, we propose a novel refresh technique based on a simple iterative process: randomly selecting and updating two shares with fresh randomness. While not perfectly secure in the standard probing model, this method achieves arbitrary cardinal-RPC security, making it a versatile tool for constructing random-probing secure circuits. Using this refresh, we develop additional basic gadgets (e.g., linear multiplication, addition, and copy) that satisfy the cardinal-RPC notion. Despite the increased complexity, the gains in security significantly outweigh the overhead, with the number of iterations offering useful flexibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo showcase our techniques, we apply them to lattice-based signatures. Specifically, we introduce a new random-probing composable gadget for sampling small noise, a key component in various post-quantum algorithms. To assess security in this context, we generalize the random probing security model to address auxiliary inputs and public outputs. We apply our findings to Raccoon, a masking-friendly signature scheme originally designed for standard probing security. We prove the secure composition of our new gadgets for key generation and signature computation, and show that our masking scheme achieves a superior security-performance tradeoff compared to previous approaches based on random probing expansion. To our knowledge, this is the first fully secure instantiation of a post-quantum algorithm in the random probing model.",

The main families of fields used in cryptography are the highly predominant cyclotomic fields (used for instance in the HAWK scheme), as well as the NTRU Prime fields, used for instance in the eponymous NTRU Prime scheme (Bernstein, Chuengsatiansup, Lange, van Vredendaal, SAC 2017).\r\n\r\nIn this work, we generalize the attack of Mureau et al. against rank-$2$ module-LIP to the family of all number fields with at least one real embedding, which contains the NTRU Prime fields. We present three variants of our attack, firstly a heuristic one that runs in quantum polynomial time. Secondly, under the extra assumption that the defining polynomial of $K$ has a $2$-transitive Galois group (which is the case for the NTRU Prime fields), we give a provable attack that runs in quantum polynomial time. And thirdly, with the same $2$-transitivity assumption we give a heuristic attack that runs in classical polynomial time. For the latter we use a generalization of the Gentry--Szydlo algorithm to any number field which might be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Garbling is a fundamental cryptographic primitive, with numerous theoretical and practical applications. Since the first construction by Yao (FOCS\u201982, \u201986), a line of work has concerned itself with reducing the communication and computational complexity of that construction. One of the most efficient garbling schemes presently is the \u2018Half Gates\u2019 scheme by Zahur, Rosulek, and Evans (Eurocrypt\u201915). Despite its widespread adoption, the provable security of this scheme has been based on assumptions whose only instantiations are in idealized models. For example, in their original paper, Zahur, Rosulek, and Evans showed that hash functions satisfying a notion called circular correlation robustness (CCR) suffice for this task, and then proved that CCR secure hash functions can be instantiated in the random permutation model. In this work, we show how to securely instantiate the Half Gates scheme in the standard model. To this end, we first show how this scheme can be securely instantiated given a (family of) weak CCR hash function, a notion that we introduce. Furthermore, we show how a weak CCR hash function can be used to securely instantiate other efficient garbling schemes, namely the ones by Rosulek and Roy (Crypto\u201921) and Heath (Eurocrypt\u201924). Thus we believe this notion to be of independent interest. Finally, we construct such weak CCR hash functions using indistinguishability obfuscation and one-way functions. The security proof of this construction constitutes our main technical contribution. While our construction is not practical, it serves as a proof of concept supporting the soundness of these garbling schemes, which we regard to be particularly important given the recent initiative by NIST to standardize garbling, and the optimizations in Half Gates being potentially adopted.",

    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows computations on encrypted data without requiring decryption, ensuring data privacy during processing.  However, FHE introduces a significant expansion of ciphertext sizes compared to plaintexts, which results in higher communication. A practical solution to mitigate this issue is  transciphering, where only the master key is homomorphically encrypted, while the actual data is encrypted using a symmetric cipher, usually a stream cipher. The server then homomorphically evaluates the stream cipher to convert the encrypted data into a homomorphically encrypted form.\r\n\r\nWe introduce Transistor, a stream cipher specifically designed for efficient homomorphic evaluation within the TFHE scheme, a widely-used FHE framework known for its fast bootstrapping and ability to handle low-precision data. Transistor operates on $\\mathbb{F}_{17}$ which is chosen to optimize TFHE performances. Its components are carefully engineered to both control noise growth and provide strong security guarantees. First, a simple TFHE-friendly implementation technique for LFSRs allows us to use such components to cheaply increase the state size. At the same time, a small Finite State Machine is the only part of the state updated non-linearly, each non-linear operation corresponding in TFHE to a rather expensive Programmable Bootstrapping. This update is done using an AES-round-like transformation. But, in contrast to other stream ciphers like SNOW or LEX, our construction comes with information-theoretic security arguments proving that an attacker cannot obtain any information about the secret key from three or fewer consecutive keystream outputs. These information-theoretic arguments are then combined with a thorough analysis of potential correlations to bound the minimal keystream length required for recovering the secret key.\r\n\r\nOur implementation of Transistor significantly outperforms the state of the art of TFHE transciphering, achieving a throughput of over 60 bits/s on a standard CPU, all while avoiding the need for an expensive initialization process.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we consider the communication complexity of MPC protocols in honest majority setting achieving malicious security in both information-theoretic setting and computational setting. On the one hand, we study the possibility of basing honest majority MPC protocols on oblivious linear evaluation (OLE)-hybrid model efficiently with information-theoretic security. More precisely, we instantiate preprocessing phase of the recent work Sharing Transformation (Goyal, Polychroniadou, and Song, CRYPTO 2022) assuming random OLE correlations. Notably, we are able to prepare packed Beaver triples with malicious security achieving amortized communication of $O(n)$ field elements plus a number of $O(n)$ OLE correlations per packed Beaver triple, which is the best known result. To further efficiently prepare random OLE correlations, we resort to IKNP-style OT extension protocols (Ishai et al., CRYPTO 2003) in random oracle model. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we derive a communication lower bound for preparing OLE correlations in the information-theoretic setting based on negative results due to Damg\u00e5rd, Larsen, and Nielsen (CRYPTO 2019).\r\n\r\nCombining our positive result with the work of Goyal, Polychroniadou, and Song (CRYPTO 2022), we derive an MPC protocol with amortized communication of $O(\\ell+\\kappa)$ elements per gate in random oracle model achieving malicious security, where $\\ell$ denotes the length of a field element and $\\kappa$ is the security parameter.",

    "abstract": "Decentralized Autonomous Organization operates without a central entity, being owned and governed collectively by its members. In this organization, decisions are carried out automatically through smart contracts for routine tasks, while members vote for unforeseen issues. Scalability in decision-making through voting on proposals is essential to accommodate a growing number of members without sacrificing security. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a scalable and secure DAO voting system that ensures security through Groth16 zk-SNARKs and exponential ElGamal encryption algorithm while achieving scalability by verifiably delegating heavy computations to untrusted entities. While offline computation on the exponential ElGamal homomorphic encryption algorithm is enabled to reduce the computational cost of the blockchain, Groth16 is allowed to maintain robust off-chain calculation without revealing any further details. Specifically, the Groth16 proof guarantees that (i) the encrypted votes accurately reflect the voter's voting power, ensuring no unauthorized weight manipulation; (ii) only valid non-negative vote values are encrypted, preventing unintended or malicious vote tampering; and (iii) the homomorphic summation is performed correctly.  The implementation shows that the proofs are verified remarkably fast, making the S2DV protocol highly suitable for scalable DAO voting, while preserving the security of the election.",

    "abstract": "We investigate two natural relaxations of quantum cryptographic assumptions. First, we examine primitives such as pseudorandom generators ($\\text{PRG}$s) and pseudorandom states ($\\text{PRS}$s), extended with quantum input sampling, which we term $\\text{PRG}^{qs}$ and $\\text{PRS}^{qs}$. In these primitives, the input is sampled via a quantum algorithm rather than uniformly at random. The second relaxation, $\\bot$-pseudodeterminism, allows the generator to output $\\bot$ on an inverse-polynomial fraction of inputs.\r\n\r\nWe demonstrate an equivalence between (bounded-query) logarithmic-sized $\\text{PRS}^{qs}$, logarithmic-sized $\\text{PRS}^{qs}$, and $\\text{PRG}^{qs}$. Notably, such an equivalence remains unknown for the uniform key sampling versions of these primitives. Furthermore, we establish that $\\text{PRG}^{qs}$ can be constructed from $\\bot$-pseudodeterministic $\\text{PRG}$s ($\\bot\\text{-PRG}$s). \r\n\r\nTo further justify our exploration, we present two separation results. First, we examine the relationship between $\\bot$-pseudodeterministic notions and their deterministic counterparts. We show that there does not exist a black-box construction of a one-way state generator $(\\text{OWSG})$ from a $\\bot\\text{-PRG}$, indicating that $\\bot$-pseudodeterministic primitives may be inherently weaker than their deterministic counterparts. Second, we explore the distinction between quantum and uniform input sampling. We prove that there does not exist a black-box construction of a $\\bot$-psuedodeterministic $\\text{OWSG}$ from a $\\text{PRF}^{qs}$, suggesting that primitives relying on quantum input sampling may be weaker than those using traditional uniform sampling. Given the broad cryptographic applicability  of $\\text{PRF}^{qs}$s and $\\bot\\text{-PRG}$s, these separation results yield numerous new insights into the hierarchy of primitives within MicroCrypt.",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of proving the validity of computation on ciphertexts of homomorphic encryption (HE) schemes, a feature that enables outsourcing of data and computation while ensuring both data privacy and integrity.\r\nWe propose a new solution that handles computations in RingLWE-based schemes, particularly the CKKS scheme for approximate arithmetic. Our approach efficiently handles ciphertext arithmetic in the polynomial ring $R_q$ without emulation overhead and manages ciphertexts maintenance operations, such as modulus switching, key switching, and rescaling, with small cost.\r\nOur main result is a succinct argument that efficiently handles arithmetic computations and range checks over the ring $R_q$. To build this argument system, we construct new polynomial interactive oracle proofs (PIOPs) and multilinear polynomial commitments supporting polynomials over $R_q$, unlike prior work which focused on finite fields. We validate the concrete complexity of our approach through implementation and experimentation. Compared to the current state-of-the-art on verifiable HE for RNS schemes, we present similar performance for small circuits while being able to efficiently scale to larger ones, which was a major challenge for previous constructions as it requires verifying procedures such as relinearization.",

    "abstract": "The wide adoption of deep neural networks (DNNs) raises the question of how can we equip them with a desired cryptographic functionality (e.g, to decrypt an encrypted input, to verify that this input is authorized, or to hide a secure watermark in the output). The problem is that cryptographic primitives are typically designed to run on digital computers that use Boolean gates to map sequences of bits to sequences of bits, whereas DNNs are a special type of analog computer that uses linear mappings and ReLUs to map vectors of real numbers to vectors of real numbers. This discrepancy between the discrete and continuous computational models raises the question of what is the best way to implement standard cryptographic primitives as DNNs, and whether DNN implementations of secure cryptosystems remain secure in the new setting, in which an attacker can ask the DNN to process a message whose \"bits\" are arbitrary real numbers. \r\nIn this paper we lay the foundations of this new theory, defining the meaning of correctness and security for implementations of cryptographic primitives as ReLU-based DNNs. We then show that the natural implementations of block ciphers as DNNs can be broken in linear time by using such nonstandard inputs. We tested our attack in the case of full round AES-128, and had $100\\%$ success rate in finding $1000$ randomly chosen keys. Finally, we develop a new method for implementing any desired cryptographic functionality as a standard ReLU-based DNN in a provably secure and correct way. Our protective technique has very low overhead (a constant number of additional layers and a linear number of additional neurons), and is completely practical.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade and a half, cryptanalytic techniques for Salsa20 have been increasingly refined, largely following the overarching concept of Probabilistically Neutral Bits (PNBs) by Aumasson et al. (FSE 2008). In this paper, we present a novel criterion for choosing key-$\\mathcal{IV}$ pairs using certain 2-round criteria and connect that with clever tweaks of existing techniques related to Probabilistically Independent $\\mathcal{IV}$ bits (earlier used for ARX ciphers, but not for Salsa20) and well-studied PNBs. Through a detailed examination of the matrix after initial rounds of Salsa20, we introduce the first-ever cryptanalysis of Salsa20 exceeding $8$ rounds. Specifically, Salsa20/$8.5$, consisting of $256$ secret key bits, can be cryptanalyzed with a time complexity of $2^{245.84}$ and data amounting to $2^{99.47}$. Further, the sharpness of our attack can be highlighted by showing that Salsa20/$8$ can be broken with time $2^{186.01}$ and data $2^{99.73}$, which is a significant improvement over the best-known result of Coutinho et al. (Journal of Cryptology, 2023, time $2^{217.14}$ and data $2^{113.14}$). Here, the refinements related to backward biases for PNBs are also instrumental in achieving the improvements. We also provide certain instances of how these ideas improve the cryptanalysis on $128$-bit versions. In the process, a few critical points are raised on some existing state-of-the-art works in this direction, and in those cases, their estimates of time and data are revisited to note the correct complexities, revising the incorrect numbers.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic Decentralized Functional Encryption (DDFE) is a generalization of Functional Encryption which allows multiple users to join the system dynamically without interaction and without relying on a trusted third party.  Users can independently encrypt their inputs for a joint evaluation under functions embedded in functional decryption keys; and they keep control on these functions as they all have to contribute to the generation of the functional keys.\r\n \r\nIn this work, we present new generic compilers which, when instantiated with existing schemes from the literature, improve over the state-of-the-art in terms of security, computational assumptions and functionality. Specifically, we obtain the first adaptively secure DDFE schemes for inner products in both the standard and the stronger function-hiding setting which guarantees privacy not only for messages but also for the evaluated functions. Furthermore, we present the first DDFE for inner products whose security can be proven under the LWE assumption in the standard model. Finally, we give the first construction of a DDFE for the attribute-weighted sums functionality with attribute-based access control (with some limitations). All prior constructions guarantee only selective security, rely on group-based assumptions on pairings, and cannot provide access control.",

    "abstract": "Komargodski et. al. defined evolving secret-sharing schemes with an unbounded number of parties. In this model, parties arrive one after the other and the number of parties that will arrive is not known.\r\nAnother cryptographic primitive related to secret-sharing is conditional disclosure of secrets protocols (CDS) that defined by Gertner et. al. \r\nA CDS protocol for a Boolean function $f$ involves $k$ servers and a referee. Each server holds a common secret $s$, a common random string $r$, and a private input $x_i$; using these $r$, each server locally computes one message and sends it to the referee. The referee, knowing the inputs $x_1, \\cdots, x_k$ and the messages, should be able to compute $s$ if $f(x_1, \\cdots, x_k) = 1$. Otherwise, the referee should not learn information about the secret. In a sense, this is a non-monotone version of secret sharing schemes. \r\n\r\nPeter (ISC 23'), defines evolving CDS, implementing in particular evolving predicate $f:\\{0,1\\}^*\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\}$ (he handles somewhat more general predicates for larger input domains, but generalizing to other input domains is not hard, and we focus on boolean predicates). In this setting, the number of parties is unbounded, where the parties arrive in sequential order. Each party, when arrives, sends one random message to a referee, that depending on its input, the secret, and a common randomness. He also devise evolving CDS protocols for a general evolving predicate via a black-box reduction to evolving secret-sharing scheme for a related access structure.\r\nHe analyzes this construction for general access structures, as well as other classes of functions, which yields message complexity $O(2^t)$ for the worst predicates.\r\n\r\nIn this work we provide new upper and lower bounds for evolving CDS.\r\nObserving that CDS has the potential for improved efficiency, as it is not restricted to monotone operations, we devise a new evolving general CDS construction.\r\nIn particular, our construction relies on representing the evolving predicate via an infinite branching program - LINBP, generalizing the monotone infinite branching program based construction of Alon et. al of evolving secret sharing schemes.\r\nWe obtain nontrivial ($2^{ct-o(t)}$ for $c<1$) message complexity for branching programs of larger width than Alon et al's construction (even when restricting attention to monotone predicates), as well as Peter's construction for certain (but not all) $f$'s.\r\n\r\nIndeed, we prove that our construction, as well as Peter's article (ISC 23\u2019) is tight for a certain evolving predicate -- as for evolving secret-sharing, (so called strong) evolving CDS also requires share complexity of $2^{t-o(t)}$. This is unlike the state of affairs for the finite setting, where the best known CDS constructions are much more efficient than the best known secret sharing schemes (for the hardest monotone functions).\r\nThe latter bound is proved based on an adaptation of Mazor's lower bound (in turns based on Csirmaz's lower bounding technique) to the CDS setting. It relies on a reduction from secret sharing for a certain class of infinite access structures -- the so called partite access structures to evolving CDS for a related (not necessarily monotone) function. Then, a partite evolving access structure is crafted using the Csirmaz-type argument.",

    "abstract": "Ever since the introduction of encryption, society has been divided over whether the government (or law enforcement agencies) should have the capability to decrypt private messages (with or without a war- rant) of its citizens. From a technical viewpoint, the folklore belief is that semantic security always enables some form of steganography. Thus, adding backdoors to semantically secure schemes is pointless: it only weakens the security of the \u201cgood guys\u201d, while \u201cbad guys\u201d can easily circumvent censorship, even if forced to hand over their decryption keys. \r\n\r\nIn this paper we put a dent in this folklore. We formalize three worlds: Dictatoria (\u201cdictator wins\u201d: no convenient steganography, no user co- operation needed), Warrantland (\u201cchecks-and-balances\u201d: no convenient steganography, but need user\u2019s cooperation) and Privatopia (\u201cprivacy wins\u201d: built-in, high-rate steganography, even if giving away the decryption key). We give strong evidence that all these worlds are possible, thus reopening the encryption debate on a technical level. \r\n\r\nOur main novelty is the definition and design of special encryption schemes we call anamorphic-resistant (AR). In contrast to so called \u201canamorphic schemes\u201d, \u2014 which were studied in the literature and form the basis of Privatopia, \u2014 any attempt to steganographically communicate over an AR-encryption scheme will be either impossible or hugely slow (depending on the definitional details).",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces Neo, a new lattice-based folding scheme for CCS, an NP-complete relation that generalizes R1CS, Plonkish, and AIR. Neo's folding scheme can be viewed as adapting the folding scheme in HyperNova (CRYPTO'24), which assumes elliptic-curve based linearly homomorphic commitments, to the lattice setting. Unlike HyperNova, Neo can use \u201csmall\u201d prime fields (e.g., over the Goldilocks prime). Additionally, Neo provides plausible post-quantum security.\r\n\r\nPrior to Neo, folding schemes in the lattice setting, notably LatticeFold (ePrint 2024/257), worked with constraint systems defined over a cyclotomic polynomial ring. This structure allows packing a fixed batch of constraint systems over a small prime field into a single constraint system over a polynomial ring. However, it introduces significant overheads, both for committing to witnesses (e.g., the commitment scheme cannot take advantage of bit-width of values), and within the folding protocol itself (e.g., the sum-check protocol is run over cyclotomic polynomial rings). Additionally, the required ring structure places restrictions on the choice of primes (e.g., LatticeFold is not compatible with the Goldilocks field). \r\n\r\nNeo addresses these problems, by drawing inspiration from both HyperNova and LatticeFold. A key contribution is a folding-friendly instantiation of Ajtai's commitments, with \"pay-per-bit\" commitment costs i.e., the commitment costs scale with the bit-width of the scalars (e.g., committing to a vector of bits is $32\\times$ cheaper than committing to a vector of $32$-bit values). This scheme commits to vectors over a small prime field. It does so by transforming the provided vector into a matrix and committing to that matrix. We prove that this commitment scheme provides the desired linear homomorphism for building a folding scheme. Additionally, like HyperNova, Neo runs a single invocation of the sum-check protocol, where in HyperNova it is over the scalar field of an elliptic curve and in Neo it is over an extension of a small prime field.",

    "abstract": "Syndrome decoding (SD), and equivalently Learning Parity with Noise (LPN), is a fundamental problem in cryptography, which states that for a field $\\mathbb{F}$, some compressing public matrix $\\mathbf{G} \\in \\mathbb{F}^{k\\times n}$, and a secret sparse vector $\\mathbf{e} \\in\\mathbb{F}^{n}$ sampled from some noise distribution, $\\mathbf{G}\\mathbf{e}$ is indistinguishable from uniform. Recently, the SD has gained significant interest due to its use in pseudorandom correlation generators (PCGs).\r\n\r\nIn pursuit of better efficiency, we propose a new assumption called Stationary Syndrome Decoding (SSD). In SSD, we consider $q$ correlated noise vectors $\\mathbf{e}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{e}_{q}\\in \\mathbb{F}^n$ and associated instances $\\mathbf{G}_{1}\\mathbf{e}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{G}_{q}\\mathbf{e}_{q}$ where the noise vectors are restricted to having non-zeros in the same small subset of $t$ positions $L\\subset [n]$. That is, for all $i\\in L$, $\\mathbf{e}_{j,i}$ is uniformly random, while for all other $i$, $\\mathbf{e}_{j,i} = 0$.\r\n\r\nAlthough naively reusing the noise vector renders SD and LPN insecure via simple Gaussian elimination, we observe known attacks do not extend to our correlated noise. We show SSD is unconditionally secure against so-called linear attacks, e.g., advanced information set decoding and representation techniques (Esser and Santini, Crypto 2024). We further adapt the state-of-the-art nonlinear attack (Briaud and Oygarden, Eurocrypt 2023) to SSD and demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally resistance to the attack. \r\n\r\nWe apply SSD to PCGs to amortize the cost of noise generation protocol. For OT and VOLE generation, each instance requires $O(t)$ communication instead of $O(t\\log n)$. For suggested parameters, we observe a $1.5\\times$ improvement in the running time or between 6 and $18\\times$ reduction in communication. For Beaver triple generation using Ring LPN, our techniques have the potential for substantial amortization due to the high concrete overhead of the Ring LPN noise generation.",

    "abstract": "Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zkSNARKs) lead to proofs that can be succinctly verified but require huge computational resources to generate. Prior systems outsource proof generation either through public delegation, which reveals the witness to the third party, or, more preferably, private delegation that keeps the witness hidden using multiparty computation (MPC). However, current private delegation schemes struggle with scalability and efficiency due to MPC inefficiencies, poor resource utilization, and suboptimal design of zkSNARK protocols.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce DFS, a new zkSNARK that is delegation-friendly for both public and private scenarios. Prior work focused on optimizing the MPC protocols for existing zkSNARKs, while DFS uses co-design between MPC and zkSNARK so that the protocol is efficient for both distributed computing and MPC. In particular, DFS achieves linear prover time and logarithmic verification cost in the non-delegated setting. For private delegation, DFS introduces a scheme with zero communication overhead in MPC and achieves malicious security for free, which results in logarithmic overall communication; while prior work required linear communication. Our evaluation shows that DFS is as efficient as state-of-the-art zkSNARKs in public delegation; when used for private delegation, it scales better than previous work.  In particular, for $2^{24}$ constraints, the total communication of DFS is less than $500$KB, while prior work incurs $300$GB, which is linear to the circuit size. Additionally, we identify and address a security flaw in prior work, EOS (USENIX'23).",

    "abstract": "Threshold signatures have become a critical tool in cryptocurrency systems, offering enhanced security by distributing the signing process among multiple signers. In this work, we distribute this process between a client and a permissionless decentralized blockchain, and present novel protocols for ECDSA and EdDSA/Schnorr signatures in this setting. Typical threshold access architectures used by trusted custodians suffer from the honeypot problem, wherein the more assets the custodian holds, the greater the incentive of compromising it.\r\n\r\nImplementing threshold signatures over permissionless blockchains poses a few challenges.\r\nFirst, existing networks typically work over an asynchronous reliable broadcast communication channel. Accordingly, our protocol is implemented over such a channel. As a result, it also benefits from identifiable abort, public verifiability, and guaranteed output delivery, and the client benefits from censorship resistance of blockchain systems.\r\nSecond, upon signing each block, the participating quorum may dynamically change and is post-determined.\r\nTherefore, we design a fluid protocol, that supports a post-determined dynamic quorum in each communication round, thereby complying with existing broadcast channel implementations. Third, in permissionless networks, parties may join, leave, and change their stake. Therefore, we offer protocols for network reconfiguration, with complexity independent of the number of clients in the system, and our protocol efficiently supports a weighted threshold access structure for the network. Specifically, the complexity of distributed key generation and presign only depends on the number of parties and not on the overall weight, and the amortized cost of sign only depends on the individual weight.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, our protocol introduces key improvements, including the removal of zero-knowledge proofs towards the client, and presigns with a non-interactive client. For Schnorr, the presigns are client-independent, and can be collected by the blockchain in a common pool, available for all clients in the system. These optimizations reduce communication overhead and improve the system's ability to handle traffic spikes during high-demand periods.\r\n\r\nOur protocol is UC-secure, and is therefore natively designed for multiple clients to use the system in parallel. Notably, we propose a novel assumption, Slightly-Enhanced ECDSA Unforgeability, offering concrete security for 256-bit elliptic curves for threshold ECDSA with support for parallel execution of presigns.\r\n\r\nIn addition to securing cryptocurrency wallets, we demonstrate how our protocol enables various cross-chain applications, such as decentralized bridges, future transactions, andwallet transfer. Our system is designed for interoperability across multiple blockchains, enhancing security, scalability, and flexibility for decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology\r\nrecently standardized the first set of post-quantum cryptography algo-\r\nrithms. These algorithms address the quantum threat, but also present\r\nnew challenges due to their larger memory and computational footprint.\r\nThree of the four standardized algorithms are lattice based, offering good\r\nperformance but posing challenges due to complex implementation and\r\nintricate security assumptions. A more conservative choice for quantum-\r\nsafe authentication are hash-based signature systems. However, due to\r\nlarge signature sizes and low signing speeds, hash-based systems have\r\nonly found use in niche applications.

We demonstrate\r\nthis in the context of user authentication using hardware security keys\r\nwithin FIDO. Our SPHINCS+-based implementation can even outper-\r\nform lattice-based solutions while remaining highly portable.

    "abstract": "The Fujisaki-Okamoto transform (FO) is the go-to method for achieving chosen-ciphertext (CCA) security for post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs). An important step in FO is augmenting the decryption/ decapsulation algorithm with a re-encryption step -- the decrypted message is re-encrypted to check whether the correct encryption randomness was used. While solving a security problem (ciphertext-malleability), re-encryption has turned out to introduce side-channel vulnerabilities and is computationally expensive, which has lead designers to searching for alternatives. In this work, we perform a comprehensive study of such alternatives. We formalize a central security property, computational rigidity, and show that it is sufficient  for obtaining CCA security. We present a framework for analyzing algorithms that can replace re-encryption and still achieve rigidity, and analyze existing proposals in this framework.\r\nAlong the way, we pick up a novel QROM security statement for explicitly rejecting KEMs based on  deterministic PKE schemes, something that so far only was possible when requiring a hard-to-ensure quantum property for the base PKE scheme.",

    "abstract": "Although privately programmable pseudorandom functions (PPPRFs) are known to have numerous applications, so far, the only known constructions rely on Learning with Error (LWE) or indistinguishability obfuscation.  We show how to construct a relaxed PPPRF with only one-way functions (OWF). The resulting PPPRF satisfies $1/\\textsf{poly}$ security and works for polynomially sized input domains. Using the resulting PPPRF, we can get new results for preprocessing Private Information Retrieval (PIR) that improve the state of the art. Specifically, we show that relying only on OWF, we can get a 2-server preprocessing PIR with polylogarithmic bandwidth while consuming $\\widetilde{O}_\\lambda(N^{\\frac12 + \\epsilon})$ client space and $N^{1+\\epsilon}$ server space for an arbitrarily small constant $\\epsilon \\in (0, 1)$. In the 1-server setting, we get a preprocessing PIR from OWF that achieves polylogarithmic online bandwidth and $\\widetilde{O}_\\lambda(N^{\\frac12 + \\epsilon})$ offline bandwidth, while preserving the same client and server space as before. Our result, in combination with the lower bound of Ishai, Shi, and Wichs (CRYPTO'24), establishes a tight understanding of the bandwidth and client space tradeoff for 1-server preprocessing PIR from Minicrypt assumptions. Interestingly, we are also the first to show non-trivial ways to combine client-side and server-side preprocessing to get improved results for PIR.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines whether a revocation function can be added to a protocol, protocol FSU, that has been adopted as an international standard, ISO/IEC11770-3. Protocol FSU is an IB-AKE protocol based on a mathematical problem, an asymmetric gap bilinear Diffie--Hellman (GBDH) problem.\r\nTo make protocol FSU revocable, a generic technique is applied, which converts an identity-based encryption scheme to a revocable identity-based encryption scheme by introducing a symmetric-key encryption scheme. In addition, to make the converted RIB-AKE protocol efficient, we reduce ephemeral information exchanged in the protocol, and introduce an additional parameter to the master public-key where the secret information of the additional parameter is not needed to include in the master secret-key.\r\nWe discuss the security of the resultant protocol, and prove that it is rid-eCK secure under the asymmetric GBDH assumption.",

    "abstract": "Verifiable Computation over encrypted data (VC) faces a critical dilemma between two competing paradigms: SNARK-FHE (applying SNARKs to prove FHE operations) and FHE-SNARK (homomorphically evaluating SNARK proofs). There are two interesting questions remain open to solving such a dilemma: 1) Are they identical in terms of security? 2) How practically efficient can we get? This work answers these questions through the following results: \r\n\r\n1) We establish a formal security analysis between VC and secure two-party computation (2PC). We investigate VC with server inputs and show the following: a) VC with server input has an exact 1-bit security loss compared to 2PC; b)  SNARK-FHE aligns with 2PC while  FHE-SNARK  naturally falls in the VC category; c) Existing  FHE-SNARK  works is vulnerable in the VC with server input setting, for which we formalize a input-dependent attack.\r\n\r\n2) We design an FHE-friendly SNARK that is: a) 3\u00d7 lower multiplicative depth than FRI-based SNARKs;  b) Compatible with FHE SIMD operations. Based on this novel SNARK, we construct an FHE-SNARK scheme that has: a) Stronger security: resistant against input-dependent attack; b) 8\u00d7 speedup: 3.6-hour proof generation for $2^{20}$-gate circuits  on a single core CPU (vs. 29 hours in the state-of-the-art); c) Practical verification: 65.3 MB proofs with 2.7 seconds verification (single core).",

    "abstract": "The celebrated Algorand protocol solves validated byzantine agreement in a scalable manner in the synchronous setting. In this paper, we study the feasibility of similar solutions in the asynchronous setting. Our main result is an asynchronous validated byzantine agreement protocol that we call Asynchronous Algorand. As with Algorand, it terminates in an expected constant number of rounds, and honest parties send an expected $O(n ~\\mathsf{polylog}~n)$ bits, where $n$ is the number of parties. The protocol is resilient to a fully-asynchronous weakly-adaptive adversary that can corrupt a near-optimal number of parties ($<(1/3-\\epsilon) n$) and requires just a VRF setup and secure erasures.\r\n\r\nA key innovation in Asynchronous Algorand is a rather simple but surprisingly effective method to do \\textit{committee-based role assignment} for asynchronous verifiable secret sharing in the YOSO (You Only Speak Once) model. This method achieves near-optimal resilience and near-linear communication complexity while relying solely on a verifiable random function (VRF) setup and secure erasures.",

    "abstract": "The concept of Anamorphic Encryption (Persiano, Phan and Yung, Eurocrypt '22), aims to enable private communication in settings where the usage of encryption is heavily controlled by a central authority (henceforth called the dictator) who can obtain users' secret keys.\r\nSince then, various works have improved our understanding of AE in several aspects, including its limitations. To this regard, two recent works constructed various Anamorphic-Resistant Encryption (ARE) schemes, i.e., schemes admitting at most $O(\\log(\\lambda))$ bits of covert communication.\r\nHowever, those results are still unsatisfactory, each coming with at least one of the following issues: (1) use of cryptographic heavy hammers such as indistinguishability obfuscation (iO); (2) abuse of the original definition to define overly powerful dictators; (3) reliance on the Random Oracle Model (ROM). In particular, proofs in the ROM are controversial as they fail to account for anamorphic schemes making non-black-box usage of the hash function used to instantiate the Random Oracle. \r\nIn this work, we overcome all of these limitations.\r\nFirst, we describe an anamorphic-resistant encryption (ARE) scheme approaching practicality by relying only on public-key encryption and Extremely Lossy Functions (ELFs), both known from the (exponential) DDH assumption. Moreover, further assuming Unique NIZKs (known from iO), we provide another construction, which we later use to realize the first $\\textit{definitive}$ ARE; that is, a $\\textit{single}$ scheme that $\\textit{simultaneously}$ achieves the strongest level of anamorphic resistance against each of the possible levels of anamorphic security.",

    "abstract": "Indistinguishability obfuscation (\\iO) is a powerful cryptographic primitive\r\nand has been quoted as the ``swiss army-knife of modern cryptography''.   Most prior works on \\iO focused on theoretical feasibility, and paid less attention to the efficiency of the constructions.   As a result, all prior constructions stopped at  achieving polynomial efficiency without worrying  about how large the polynomial is.\r\nIn fact, it has even been conjectured that  a polynomial dependence on the input length is necessary.  \r\n\r\nIn this work, we show that if the two circuits to be obfuscated enjoy a succinct propositional logic proof of equivalence, then we can  \r\ncreate obfuscated versions of  these programs that are computationally indistinguishable; and importantly, the obfuscated program's efficiency is quasi-linear in the circuit size and proof size.  We show that our quasi-linear \\iO construction also leads to new applications. Specifically, we show how to achieve quasi-linear efficiency for 1) \\iO for Turing Machines with unbounded inputs, and 2) multi-input functional encryption, also assuming succinct proofs of equivalence.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of embedded code encryption, i.e., encryption for binary software code for a secure microcontroller that is stored in an insecure external memory. As every single instruction must be decrypted before it can be executed, this scenario requires an extremely low latency decryption. We present a formal treatment of embedded code encryption security definitions, propose three constructions, namely ACE1, ACE2 and ACE3, and analyze their security. Further, we present ChiLow, a family of tweakable block ciphers and a related PRF specifically designed for embedded code encryption. At the core of ChiLow, there is ChiChi, a new family of non-linear layers of even dimension based on the well-known \u03c7 function. Our fully unrolled hardware implementation of ChiLow, using the Nangate 15nm Open Cell Library, achieves a decryption latency of less than 280 picoseconds.",

    "abstract": "Receiver anamorphic encryption (hereafter anamorphic encryption), introduced by Persiano et al. at Eurocrypt 2022, allows for a double message to be symmetrically hidden in a public-key encryption ciphertext via a pre-shared -double key-. In anamorphic encryption, confidentiality must be preserved even if the adversary (or the -dictator-) has access to all regular keys. It has been the subject of several works since its introduction that explore tweaks and extensions to the core primitive. However, this study has not been systematic, and so disparate security notions have been proposed, for which their relationships are not clear. Moreover, there are clear gaps in the literature, including in the treatment of chosen-ciphertext attacks.\r\n    \r\nIn this work, we conduct a systematic study of receiver anamorphic encryption. We unify existing security notions and propose several new ones, and prove implications and separations between them. Our main findings are as follows. First, we identify gaps in previous security notions against an anamorphic -sender-, namely an adversary who is given the double key, and propose three new security notions to bridge these gaps. We also identify several gaps in the treatment of chosen-ciphertext attacks, a setting only very recently considered in anamorphic cryptography (Jaeger and Stracovsky, Asiacrypt 2024). Moreover, observing that no previous construction achieves all desirable security properties in this setting, we propose a suitable construction that does. Finally, we propose several security notions for -asymmetric- anamorphic encryption, and explore the case here where the dictator and the anamorphic sender collude.",

    "abstract": "Non-interactive key exchange (NIKE) is a simple and elegant cryptographic primitive that allows two or more users to agree on a secret shared key without any interaction. NIKE schemes have been formalized in different scenarios (such as the public-key, or the identity-based setting), and have found many applications in cryptography.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose a NIKE variant that generalizes public-key and identity-based NIKE: a multi-authority identity-based NIKE (MA-ID-NIKE) is defined like an identity-based NIKE, only with several identity domains (i.e., several instances of an identity-based NIKE), and such that users from different identity domains can compute shared keys. This makes MA-ID-NIKE schemes more versatile than existing NIKE or identity-based NIKE schemes, for instance, in an application in which users from different (centrally managed) companies need to compute shared keys.\r\n\r\nWe show several results for MA-ID-NIKE schemes:\r\n - We show that MA-ID-NIKE schemes generically imply public-key NIKEs, identity-based NIKEs, as well as forward-secure NIKE schemes, the latter of which are notoriously hard to construct.\r\n - We propose two simple constructions of MA-ID-NIKE schemes from indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) and multilinear maps, respectively. These constructions achieve only selective security, but can be leveraged to adaptive security for small groups of users (that want to be able to agree on a joint shared key) in the random oracle model.\r\n - We give a simple and elegant construction of MA-ID-NIKEs from identity-based encryption (IBE) and universal samplers. This construction achieves adaptive security also for large groups of users based on the adaptive security of the used universal samplers. Universal samplers, in turn, are known to be achievable using iO in the random oracle model. As a nice feature, the same construction yields hierarchical MA-ID-NIKEs or public-key NIKEs when instantiated with hierarchical IBE or public-key encryption instead of IBE schemes.\r\nWhile these results are clearly only feasibility results, they do demonstrate the achievability of a concept that itself has very practical use cases.",

    "abstract": "Succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (SNARKs) are variants of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (NIZKs) in which complex statements can be proven in a compact way. SNARKs have had tremendous impact in several areas of cryptography, including verifiable computing, blockchains, and anonymous communication. A recurring concept in many applications is the concept of recursive SNARKs, in which a proof references a previous proof to show an evolved statement.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we investigate malleable SNARKs, a generalization of this concept of recursion. An adaptation of the existing concept of malleable NIZKs, malleable SNARKs allow to modify SNARK proofs to show related statements, but such that such mauled proofs are indistinguishable from \u201cproperly generated\u201d fresh proofs of the related statement. We show how to instantiate malleable SNARKs for universal languages and relations, and give a number of applications: the first post-quantum RCCA-secure rerandomizable and updatable encryption schemes, a generic construction of reverse firewalls, and an unlinkable (i.e., computation-hiding) targeted malleable homomorphic encryption scheme.\r\n\r\nTechnically, our malleable SNARK construction relies on recursive proofs, but with a twist: in order to support the strong indistinguishability properties of mauled and fresh SNARK proofs, we need to allow an unbounded recursion depth. To still allow for a reasonable notion of extractability in this setting (and in particular to guarantee that extraction eventually finishes with a \u201cproper\u201d witness that does not refer to a previous SNARK proof), we rely on a new and generic computational primitive called adversarial one-way function (AOWF) that may be of independent interest. We give an AOWF candidate and prove it secure in the random oracle model.",

    "abstract": "A threshold verifiable random function (threshold VRF) is a VRF where the evaluation key is secret shared among $n$ parties, and a quorum of $t$ parties is needed to evaluate the VRF. Threshold VRFs are used widely in practice in applications such as randomness beacons and deterministic wallets. Despite their long history, the question of accountability for leaking key shares in a threshold VRF has not been studied. Specifically, consider a set of $f$ parties who use their key shares to create an evaluation box $E$ that lets anyone evaluate the VRF at any point in the domain of the VRF. When $f$ is less than the threshold $t$, this box $E$ must also take as input $t-f$ additional evaluation shares. Our goal is to design a threshold VRF where there is a tracing algorithm that can trace any such box $E$ to the coalition of $f$ parties that created it, using only blackbox access to $E$. The risk of tracing should deter the coalition from selling such a box. Questions in this vein were previously explored in the context of threshold decryption and secret sharing. Here we define and study traceability for a threshold VRF. \r\n\r\nOur traceable threshold VRF is built from a VRF based on Paillier encryption. The starting point for our tracing algorithm is the tracing technique of Boneh-Partap-Rotem (Crypto 2024) designed for tracing leaks in the context of secret sharing. However, there are multiple technical challenges in making this approach work, and we develop the necessary tools to overcome all these challenges. The end result is a threshold VRF with a provably secure tracing algorithm.",

    "abstract": "We propose new techniques for enhancing the efficiency of $\\Sigma$-protocols in lattice settings.\r\n  One major challenge in lattice-based $\\Sigma$-protocols is restricting the norm of the extracted witness in soundness proofs.\r\n  Most of existing solutions either repeat the protocol several times or opt for a relaxation version of the original relation.\r\n  Recently, Boneh and Chen have propose an innovative solution called $\\mathsf{LatticeFold}$,\r\n  which utilizes a sum-check protocol to enforce the norm bound on the witness.\r\n  In this paper, we elevate this idea to efficiently proving multiple polynomial relations without relaxation.\r\n  Simply incorporating the techniques from $\\mathsf{LatticeFold}$ into $\\Sigma$-protocols leads to inefficient results;\r\n  therefore, we introduce several new techniques to ensure efficiency.\r\n  First, to enable the amortization in [AC20] for multiple polynomial relations,\r\n  we propose a general linearization technique to reduce polynomial relations to homomorphic ones.\r\n  Furthermore, we generalize the folding protocol in LatticeFold, enabling us to efficiently perform folding and other complex operations multiple times without the need to repeatedly execute sum-checks. Moreover, we achieve zero-knowledge by designing hiding claims and elevating the zero-knowledge sum-check protocol [XZZ+19] on rings.\r\n  Our protocol achieves standard soundness, thereby enabling the efficient integration of the compressed $\\Sigma$-protocol theory [AC20, ACF21] in lattice settings.",

    "abstract": "The public comments received for the review process for NIST (SP) 800-38A pointed out two important issues that most companies face: (1) the limited security that AES can provide due to its 128-bit block size and (2) the problem of nonce-misuse in practice. In this paper, we provide an alternative solution to these problems by introducing two optimally secure deterministic authenticated encryption (DAE) schemes, denoted as DENC1 and DENC2 respectively. We show that our proposed constructions improve the state-of-the-art in terms of security and efficiency. Specifically, DENC1 achieves a robust security level of $O(r^2\\sigma^2\\ell/2^{2n})$, while DENC2 attains a near-optimal security level of $O(r\\sigma/2^{n})$, where $\\sigma$ is the total number of blocks, $\\ell$ is maximum number of blocks in each query, and $r$ is a user-defined parameter closely related to the rate of the construction. Our research centers on the development of two IV-based encryption schemes, referred to as IV1 and IV2, which respectively offer security levels of $O(r^2\\sigma^2\\ell/2^{2n})$ and $O(r\\sigma/2^{n})$. Notably, both of our DAE proposals are nearly rate 1/2 constructions. In terms of efficiency, our proposals compare favorably with state-of-the-art AE modes on contemporary microprocessors.",

    "abstract": "SCARF is a tweakable block cipher dedicated to cache address randomization, proposed at the USENIX Security conference.  It has a 10-bit block, 48-bit tweak, and 240-bit key.  SCARF is aggressively optimized to meet the harsh latency constraints of cache address randomization, and uses a dedicated model for its security claim.\r\nThe full version of SCARF has 8 rounds, and its designers claim security up to $2^{40}$ queries and $2^{80}$ computations.  In this work we present a distinguisher against 6-round SCARF under the collision model with time and query complexity $2^{30}$, and a key-recovery attack against the full 8-round SCARF under the encryption-decryption model with $2^{39}$ queries and time $2^{76.2}$. As part of the attack, we present a novel method to compute the minimal number of right pairs following a differential characteristic when the input pairs are restricted to a subspace of the domain of the primitive.",

    "abstract": "We introduce $\\mathsf{Zinc}$, a hash-based succinct argument for integer arithmetic. $\\mathsf{Zinc}$'s goal is to provide a practically efficient scheme that  bypasses the arithmetization overheads that many succinct arguments present. These overheads can be of orders of magnitude in many applications. By enabling proving statements over the integers, we are able to arithmetize many operations of interest with almost no overhead. This includes modular operations involving any moduli, not necessarily prime, and possibly involving multiple moduli in the same statement. In particular, $\\mathsf{Zinc}$ allows to prove statements for the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ for arbitrary $n\\geq 1$. Importantly, and departing from prior work, our schemes are purely code and hash-based, and do not require hidden order groups. In its final form, $\\mathsf{Zinc}$ operates similarly to other hash-based schemes using Brakedown as their PCS, and at the same time it benefits from the arithmetization perks brought by  working over $\\mathbb{Z}$ (and $\\mathbb{Q}$) natively. \r\n\r\nAt its core, $\\mathsf{Zinc}$ is a succinct argument for proving relations over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, even though when applied to integer statements, an honest prover and verifier will only operate with small integers. $\\mathsf{Zinc}$ consists of two main components: 1) $\\mathsf{Zinc}$-$\\mathsf{PIOP}$, a framework for proving algebraic statements over the rationals by reducing modulo a randomly chosen prime $q$, followed by running a suitable PIOP over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ (this is similar to the approach taken in prior works, with the difference that we use localizations of $\\mathbb{Q}$ to enable prime modular projection); and 2) $\\mathsf{Zip}$, a Brakedown-type polynomial commitment scheme built from an IOP of proximity to the integers, a novel primitive that we introduce. The latter primitive guarantees that a prover is using a polynomial with coefficients close to being integral. With these two primitives in place, one can use a lookup argument over the rationals to ensure that the witness contains only integer elements.",

    "abstract": "We present PIR protocols for offline/online two-server setting where a client $C$ wants to privately retrieve a batch of entries from database of size $N$ by interacting with a servers $S_1$. The client has interacted with a server $S_2$ ahead of time, not colluding with $S_1$. We present simple protocols based on one-way functions that substantially improve on the query complexity or runtime over existing works. Concrete instantiations of our general paradigm lead to batch PIR protocols with the following parameters:\r\n    - A protocol for batches of $\\sqrt{N}$, where $C,S_1$, and $S_2$ each spend a total of $\\tilde{O}(N)$ work and exchange $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{N})$ bits of communication. This yields an amortized complexity of $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{N})$ work and $\\tilde{O}(1)$ communication per query in the batch.\r\n   - A more balanced protocol for batches of size $N^{1/3}$ in which $C$ spends a total of $\\tilde{O}(N^{2/3})$ work, $S_1$ and $S_2$ spend $\\tilde{O}(N)$ work, and the total communication is of size $\\tilde{O}(N^{2/3})$.\r\n  Our protocols have immediate applications such as Private Set Intersection (PSI) in the two-server setting with preprocessing and unbalanced set sizes.",

    "abstract": "A secret sharing scheme allows a trusted dealer to divide a secret among multiple parties so that a sufficient number of them can recover the secret, while a smaller group cannot. In CRYPTO'21, Goyal, Song, and Srinivasan introduced Traceable Secret Sharing (TSS), which enhances traditional secret sharing by enabling the identification of parties involved in secret reconstruction, deterring malicious behavior like selling shares. Recently, Boneh, Partap, and Rotem (CRYPTO'24) presented two more efficient TSS schemes. However, these existing TSS schemes assume that all distributed shares are valid and shareholders act honestly during the secret reconstruction phase. In this paper, we introduce Traceable Verifiable Secret Sharing (TVSS), a concept designed to ensure both traceability and verifiability in the face of malicious actions by either the dealer or shareholders. We propose a general strategy for transforming a Shamir-based, computationally secure Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme into an efficient TVSS scheme. Building on this strategy, we construct two practical TVSS schemes in the honest-majority setting, based on  well-known VSS schemes proposed by Feldman (SFCS'87) and Pedersen (CRYPTO'91). Our proposed TVSS schemes retain public shareholder indexes, enhancing flexibility in designing accountable threshold protocols (e.g., Distributed Key Generation protocols) using TVSS. Compared to the original VSS schemes, the individual share size in the new TVSS schemes increases by only a single field element and is just two or three times the size of the main secret. \r\nMotivated by a recent study on Accountable Threshold Cryptosystems (ATCs) by Boneh, Partap, and Rotem (CRYPTO'24), and by leveraging our proposed Feldman-based TVSS scheme, we also introduce an efficient ATC based on ElGamal cryptosystem. This new ATC enables a tracer to uniquely identify the parties involved in the decryption process while introducing minimal overhead to existing actively secure (and/or robust) threshold protocols built on the ElGamal cryptosystem.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel single-trace side-channel attack on FALCON\u2014a lattice-based post-quantum digital signature protocol recently approved for standardization by NIST. We target the discrete Gaussian sampling operation within the FALCON key generation scheme and use a single power measurement trace to succeed. Notably, negating the \u2018shift right 63-bit\u2019 operation (for 64-bit values) leaks critical information about the \u2018-1\u2019 vs. \u20180\u2019 assignments to intermediate coefficients. These leaks enable full recovery of the generated secret keys. The proposed attack is simulated on the ELMO simulator running both reference and optimized software implementation from FALCON\u2019s NIST Round 3 package. Statistical analysis with 20k tests reveals a full key-recovery success rate of 100% for FALCON-512. This work highlights the vulnerability of current software solutions to single-trace attacks and underscores the urgent need to develop single-trace resilient software for embedded systems in the presilicon phase.",

    "abstract": "Recent applications and attacks have highlighted the need for authenticated encryption (AE) schemes to achieve the so-called committing security beyond privacy and authenticity. As a result, several generic solutions have been proposed to transform a non-committing AE scheme to a committing one, for both basic unique-nonce security and advanced misuse-resistant (MR) security. We observe that all existing practical generic transforms are subject to at least one of the following limitations: (i) not committing to the entire encryption context, (ii) involving non-standard primitives, (iii) not being a black-box transform, (iv) providing limited committing security. Furthermore, so far, there has been no generic transform that can directly elevate a basic AE scheme to a committing AE scheme that offers MR security. Our work fills these gaps by developing black-box generic transforms that crucially rely on hash functions, which are well standardized and widely deployed.\r\n\r\nFirst, we construct three basic transforms that combine AE with a single hash function, which we call $\\mathsf{HtAE}, \\mathsf{AEaH}$ and $\\mathsf{EtH}$. They all guarantee strong security, and $\\mathsf{EtH}$ can be applied to both AE and basic privacy-only encryption schemes. Next, for MR security, we propose two advanced hash-based transforms that we call $\\mathsf{AEtH}$ and $\\mathsf{chaSIV}$. $\\mathsf{AEtH}$ is an MRAE-preserving transform that adds committing security to an MR-secure AE scheme. $\\mathsf{chaSIV}$ is the first generic transform that can directly elevate basic AE to one with both committing and MR security; moreover, $\\mathsf{chaSIV}$ also works with arbitrary privacy-only encryption schemes. Both of them feature a simple design and ensure strong security.\r\n\r\nFor performance evaluation, we compare our transforms to similar existing ones, both in theory and through practical implementations. The results show that our $\\mathsf{AEaH}$ achieves the highest practical efficiency among basic transforms, while $\\mathsf{AEtH}$ excels in MRAE-preserving transforms. Our MRAE-lifting transform $\\mathsf{chaSIV}$ demonstrates comparable performance to MRAE-preserving ones and surpasses them for messages larger than approximately $360$ bytes; for longer messages, it even outperforms the benchmark, non-committing standardized $\\mathsf{AES}\\text{-}\\mathsf{GCM}\\text{-}\\mathsf{SIV}$.",

    "abstract": "In many areas of cybersecurity, we require access to Personally Identifiable Information (PII), such as names, postal addresses and email addresses. Unfortunately, this can lead to data breaches, especially in relation to data compliance regulations such as GDPR. An IP address is a typical identifier which is used to map a network address to a person. Thus, in applications which are privacy-aware, we may aim to hide the IP address while aiming to determine if the address comes from a blacklist. One solution to this is to use homomorphic encryption to match an encrypted version of an IP address to a blacklisted network list. This matching allows us to encrypt the IP address and match it to an encrypted version of a blacklist. In this paper, we use the OpenFHE library \\cite{OpenFHE} to convert network addresses into the BFV homomorphic encryption method. In order to assess the performance impact of BFV, it implements a matching method using the OpenFHE library and compares this against the partial homomorphic methods of Paillier, Damgard-Jurik, Okamoto-Uchiyama, Naccache-Stern and Benaloh. The main findings are that the BFV method compares favourably against the partial homomorphic methods in most cases.",

    "abstract": "Broadcast encryption allows a user to encrypt a message to $N$ recipients with a ciphertext whose size scales sublinearly with $N$. The natural security notion for broadcast encryption is adaptive security which allows an adversary to choose the set of recipients after seeing the public parameters. Achieving adaptive security in broadcast encryption is challenging, and in the plain model, the primary technique is the celebrated dual-systems approach, which can be implemented over groups with bilinear maps. Unfortunately, it has been challenging to replicate the dual-systems approach in other settings (e.g., with lattices or witness encryption). Moreover, even if we focus on pairing-based constructions, the dual-systems framework critically relies on decisional (and source-group) assumptions. We do not have constructions of adaptively-secure broadcast encryption from search (or target-group) assumptions in the plain model.\r\n\r\nGentry and Waters (EUROCRYPT 2009) described a compiler that takes any semi-statically-secure broadcast encryption scheme and transforms it into an adaptively-secure scheme in the random oracle model. While semi-static security is easier to achieve and constructions are known from witness encryption as well as search (and target-group) assumptions on pairing groups, the transformed scheme relies on random oracles. In this work, we show that using publicly-sampleable projective PRGs, we can achieve adaptive security in the plain model. We then show how to build publicly-sampleable projective PRGs from many standard number-theoretic assumptions (e.g., CDH, LWE, RSA).\r\n\r\nOur compiler yields the first adaptively-secure broadcast encryption scheme from search assumptions as well as the first such scheme from witness encryption in the plain model. We also obtain the first adaptively-secure pairing-based scheme in the plain model with $O_\\lambda(N)$-size public keys and $O_\\lambda(1)$-size ciphertexts (where $O_\\lambda(\\cdot)$ suppresses polynomial factors in the security parameter $\\lambda$). Previous adaptively-secure pairing-based schemes in the plain model with $O_\\lambda(1)$-size ciphertexts required $O_\\lambda(N^2)$-size public keys.",

    "abstract": "The study of fine-grained cryptography has proliferated in recent years due to its allure of potentially relying on weaker assumptions compared to standard cryptography. As fine-grained cryptography only requires polynomial gaps between the adversary and honest parties, it seems plausible to build primitives relying upon popular hardness assumptions about problems in $\\mathbf{P}$ such as $k$-$\\mathsf{SUM}$ or $\\mathsf{Zero}$-$k$-$\\mathsf{Clique}$. The ultimate hope is that fine-grained cryptography could still be viable even if all current cryptographic assumptions are false, such as if $\\mathbf{P} = \\mathbf{NP}$ or if we live in Pessiland where one-way functions do not exist.\r\n\r\nIn our work, we consider whether this approach is viable by studying fine-grained complexity when all standard cryptographic assumptions are false. As our main result, we show that many popular fine-grained complexity problems are easy to solve in the average-case when one-way functions do not exist. In other words, many candidate hardness assumptions for building fine-grained cryptography are no longer options in Pessiland. As an example, we prove that the average-case $k$-$\\mathsf{SUM}$ and $\\mathsf{Zero}$-$k$-$\\mathsf{Clique}$ conjectures are false for sufficiently large constant $k$ when no one-way functions exist. The average-case $\\mathsf{Zero}$-$k$-$\\mathsf{Clique}$ assumption was used to build fine-grained key-exchange by Lavigne et al. [CRYPTO'19].\r\n\r\nWe also show that barriers for reductions in fine-grained complexity may be explained by problems in cryptography. First, we show that finding faster algorithms for computing discrete logarithms is equivalent to designing average-case equivalence between $k$-$\\mathsf{SUM}$ and $k$-$\\mathsf{CYC}$ (an extension of $k$-$\\mathsf{SUM}$ to cyclic groups). In particular, finding such a reduction from $k$-$\\mathsf{CYC}$ to $k$-$\\mathsf{SUM}$ could potentially lead to breakthrough algorithms for the discrete logarithm, factoring, RSA and quadratic residuosity problems. Finally, we show that discrete logarithms with preprocessing may be reduced to the $k$-$\\mathsf{CYC}$-$\\mathsf{Index}$ problem, and we present faster algorithms for average-case $k$-$\\mathsf{SUM}$-$\\mathsf{Index}$ and $k$-$\\mathsf{CYC}$-$\\mathsf{Index}$.",

    "abstract": "We show a black box barrier against constructing public key quantum money from obfuscation for evasive functions. As current post-quantum obfuscators based on standard assumptions are all evasive, this shows a fundamental barrier to achieving public key quantum money from standard tools. Our impossibility applies to black box schemes where (1) obfuscation queries made by the mint are classical, and (2) the verifier only makes (possibly quantum) evaluation queries, but no obfuscation queries. This class seems to capture any natural method of using obfuscation to build quantum money.",

    "abstract": "A Garbling Scheme is a fundamental cryptographic primitive, with numerous theoretical and practical applications.  Since its inception by Yao (FOCS'82, '86), optimizing the communication and computation complexities of securely garbling circuits has been an area of active research. One such optimization, and perhaps the most fundamental, is the `Free-XOR' technique (Kolesnikov and Schneider, ICALP'08) which allows XOR gates in a function garbling to not require representation, and therefore communication. \r\n\r\nSince then, several works have designed and analysed the security of schemes that adopt the Free-XOR optimisation. In particular: (1) Applebaum (JoC'16) proved that this can be securely instantiated assuming symmetric-key encryption satisfying a notion called RK-KDM security; and (2) Zahur, Rosulek and Evans (Eurocrypt'15) proposed the so-called `Half Gates' scheme, and proved that it can be instantiated assuming hash functions satisfying a notion called CCR security. Although both schemes have been proven selectively secure, prior work leaves it open to analyze whether they satisfy a stronger security notion -- adaptive security -- in the plain model.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we formally show that the selective security of these two schemes cannot be lifted to adaptive security under the same assumptions. To establish these barriers, we adopt techniques from the work of Kamath et al (Crypto'21), who proved similar negative results for Yao's garbling. We use that as a starting point and introduce new techniques tailored towards addressing Free-XOR-based schemes.",

    "abstract": "Bulletproofs, introduced by B\u00fcnz, Bootle, Boneh, Poelstra, Wuille and Maxwell (IEEE S&P, 2018), is a highly efficient non-interactive argument system that does not require a trusted setup. Recently, B\u00fcnz (PhD Thesis, 2023) extended Bulletproofs to support arguments for rank-1 constraint satisfaction (R1CS) systems, a widely-used representation for arithmetic satisfiability problems. Although the argument system constructed by B\u00fcnz preserves the attractive properties of Bulletproofs, it presents a gap between its completeness and soundness guarantees: The system is complete for a restricted set of instances, but sound only for a significantly broader set. Although argument systems for such gap relations nevertheless provide clear and concrete guarantees, the gaps they introduce may lead to various inconsistencies or undesirable gaps within proofs of security, especially when used as building blocks within larger systems.\r\n\r\nIn this work we show that the argument system presented by B\u00fcnz can be extended to bridge the gap between its completeness and soundness, and to additionally provide honest-verifier zero-knowledge. For the extended argument system, we introduce a refined R1CS relation that captures the precise set of instances for which both completeness and soundness hold without resorting to a gap formulation. The extended argument system preserves the performance guarantees of the argument system presented by B\u00fcnz, and yields a non-interactive argument system using the Fiat-Shamir transform.",

    "abstract": "As introduced by Persiano {\\it et al.} (Eurocrypt'22), anamorphic encryption (AE)  is a primitive enabling private communications against a dictator that forces users to surrender their decryption keys. In its fully asymmetric flavor (defined by Catalano {\\it et al.}, Eurocrypt'24), anamorphic channels can work as hidden public-key mechanisms in the sense that anamorphic encryptors are not necessarily able to decrypt anamorphic ciphertexts. Unfortunately, fully asymmetric AE is hard to come by and even impossible to obtain from ordinary public-key encryption via black-box constructions. So far, only three schemes are known to rely on well-established assumptions. In this paper, we exhibit  constructions from the standard LWE assumption based on  Regev's cryptosystem and its dual version. In both cases, we retain the additive homomorphism of the schemes. We additionally show that dual Regev is public-key anamorphic in the sense of Persiano {\\it et al.} (Crypto'24). In the FHE setting, we show that the dual GSW system provides fully asymmetric AE (while preserving its leveled homomorphism) when instantiated with binary/ternary secret keys. Along the way, we discuss the extent to which our schemes satisfy a generalization of Banfi {\\it et al.}'s notion of robustness (Eurocrypt'24) to the case of homomorphically evaluated ciphertexts.",

    "abstract": "The Fiat\u2013Shamir transformation is a fundamental cryptographic technique widely used to convert public-coin interactive protocols into non-interactive ones. This transformation is crucial in both theoretical and practical applications, particularly in the construction of succinct non-interactive arguments (SNARKs). While its security is well-established in the random oracle model, practical implementations replace the random oracle with a concrete hash function, where security is merely assumed to carry over.\r\n\r\nA growing body of work has given theoretical examples of protocols that remain secure under the Fiat\u2013Shamir transformation in the random oracle model but become insecure when instantiated with any white-box implementation of the hash function. Recent research has shown how these attacks can be applied to natural cryptographic schemes, including real-world systems. These attacks rely on a general diagonalization technique, where the protocol exploits its access to the white-box implementation of the hash function. These attacks cast serious doubt on the security of cryptographic systems deployed in practice today, leaving their soundness uncertain.\r\n\r\nWe propose a new Fiat\u2013Shamir transformation (XFS) that aims to defend against broad family of attacks, including the white-box attacks mentioned above. Our approach is designed to be practical, with minimal impact on the efficiency of the prover and verifier and on the proof length. At a high level, our transformation combines the standard Fiat\u2013Shamir technique with a new type of proof-of-work that we construct.\r\n\r\nWe provide strong evidence for the security of our transformation by proving its security in a relativized random oracle model. Specifically, we show that diagonalization attacks on the standard Fiat\u2013Shamir transformation can be mapped to analogous attacks within this model, meaning they do not rely on a concrete instantiation of the random oracle. In contrast, we prove unconditionally that our XFS variant of the Fiat\u2013Shamir transformation remains secure within this model. Consequently, any successful attack on XFS must deviate from known techniques and exploit aspects not captured by our model.\r\n\r\nWe hope that our transformation will help preserve the security of systems relying on the Fiat\u2013Shamir transformation.",

    "abstract": "Randomized functional encryption (rFE) generalizes functional encryption (FE) by incorporating randomized functionalities. Randomized multi-input functional encryption (rMIFE) extends rFE to accommodate multi-input randomized functionalities. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we reassess the framework of rFE/rMIFE enhancing our understanding of this primitive and laying the groundwork for more secure and flexible constructions in this field. Specifically, we make three key contributions:\r\n\r\n  - New definition: We identify critical gap in the existing indistinguishability-based (IND) security definition for rFE/rMIFE. Notably, current definition fails to adequately address security against malicious encryptors\u2014a crucial requirement for  rFE/rMIFE since their introduction. We propose a novel, robust IND security definition that not only addresses threats from malicious decryptors but also quantifies the security against malicious encryptors effectively.\r\n\r\n  - Counterexample: To illustrate the importance of this definitional gap, we provide a counterexample of an insecure rFE scheme that meets IND security under the previous definition but explicitly fails in a natural setting (and where this failure would be precluded by our enhanced definition). Our counterexample scheme is non-trivial and meticulously designed using standard cryptographic tools, namely FE for deterministic functions, pseudorandom function (PRF), public key encryption (PKE), and simulation-sound non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proof systems.\r\n\r\n  - Adaptive unbounded-message secure construction: The only viable prior construction of rMIFE by Goldwasser et al. [EUROCRYPT 2014] (which uses indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) and other standard assumptions) has significant limitations: it permits only a pre-defined number of messages per encryption slot and operates under selective-security constraints, requiring adversaries to declare challenge ciphertext queries and \"corrupted\" encryption keys in advance. We address these shortcomings by employing sub-exponentially secure iO. Technically, we build on and adapt methods developed by Goyal et al. [ASIACRYPT 2016] for deterministic MIFE.",

    "abstract": "Secret-sharing-based multi-party computation provides effective solutions for privacy-preserving machine learning. In this paper, we present novel protocols for privacy-preserving neural network training using Shamir secret sharing scheme over Galois rings. The specific Galois ring we use is \\(GR(2^k, d)\\), which contains $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$ as a subring. The algebraic structure of \\(GR(2^k, d)\\) enables us to benefit from Shamir scheme while performing modulo operations only on \\(2^k\\) instead of a prime number, making our protocols more compatible with modern computer architectures. We achieve the parallel processing of training data by embedding different training samples into the different coefficients of the polynomial representing a single Galois ring element, and we show that this embedding can be performed with no additional communication overhead compared to processing only one sample at a time. To evaluate our methods, we conduct private training of neural networks on the MNIST dataset between different numbers of participants. The experimental results indicate the advantages of our protocols compared to existing $\\mathbb{F}_p$-based implementations in this domain.",

    "abstract": "Ratcheted key exchange (RKE) is at the heart of modern secure messaging, enabling protocol participants to continuously update their secret material to protect against full state exposure through forward security (protecting past secrets and messages) and post-compromise security (recovering from compromise). However, many practical attacks only provide the adversary with partial access to a party's secret state, an attack vector studied under the umbrella of leakage resilience. Existing models of RKE provide suboptimal guarantees under partial leakage due to inherent limitations in security under full state exposure.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we initiate the study of leakage-resilient ratcheted key exchange that provides typical guarantees under full state exposure and additional guarantees under partial state exposure between ratchets of the protocol. We consider unidirectional ratcheted key exchange (URKE) where one party acts as the sender and the other as receiver. Building on the notions introduced by Balli, R\u00f6sler and Vaudenay (ASIACRYPT 2020), we formalise a key indistinguishability game under randomness manipulation and bounded leakage (KIND), which in particular enables the adversary to continually leak a bounded amount of the sender's state between honest send calls. We construct a corresponding protocol from a key-updatable key encapsulation mechanism (kuKEM) and a leakage-resilient one-time MAC. By instantiating this MAC in the random oracle model (ROM), results from Balli, R\u00f6sler and Vaudenay imply that in the ROM, kuKEM and KIND-secure URKE are equivalent, i.e., can be built from each other. To address the strong limitations that key indistinguishability imposes on the adversary, we formalise a one-wayness game that also permits leakage on the receiver. We then propose a corresponding construction from leakage-resilient kuKEM, which we introduce, and a leakage-resilient one-time MAC. We further show that leakage-resilient kuKEM and one-way-secure URKE are equivalent in the ROM, highlighting the cost that strong one-way security entails. Our work opens exciting directions for developing leakage-resilient messaging protocols.",

    "abstract": "Oblivious pseudorandom functions (OPRFs) are an important primitive in privacy-preserving cryptographic protocols. The growing interest in OPRFs, both in theory and practice, has led to the development of numerous constructions and variations. However, most of these constructions rely on classical assumptions. Potential future quantum attacks may limit the practicality of those OPRFs for real-world applications. \r\n\r\nTo close this gap, we introduce Leap, a novel OPRF based on heuristic lattice assumptions. Fundamentally, Leap builds upon the Spring [BBL+15] pseudorandom function (PRF), which relies on the learning with rounding assumption, and integrates techniques from multi-party computation, specifically Oblivious Transfer (OT) and Oblivious Linear Evaluation (OLE). With this combination of oblivious protocols, we construct an OPRF that evaluates in less than a millisecond on a modern computer.\r\n\r\nEfficiency-wise, our prototype implementation achieves computation times of just 11 microseconds for the client and 750 microseconds for the server, excluding some base OT preprocessing overhead. Moreover, Leap requires an online communication cost of 23 kB per evaluation, where the client only has to send around 380 bytes online. To demonstrate the practical applicability of Leap, we present an efficient private set intersection (PSI) protocol built on top of Leap. This application highlights the potential for the integration of Leap into various privacy-preserving applications: We can compute an unbalanced set intersection with set sizes of 2^24 and 2^15 in under a minute of online time and just over two minutes overall.",

    "abstract": "In Crypto'19, Goyal, Jain, and Sahai (GJS) introduced the elegant notion of *secret-sharing of an NP statement* (NPSS). Roughly speaking, a $t$-out-of-$n$ secret sharing of an NP statement is a reduction that maps an instance-witness pair to $n$ instance-witness pairs such that any subset of $(t-1)$ reveals no information about the original witness, while any subset of $t$ allows full recovery of the original witness. Although the notion was formulated for general $t \\leq n$, the only existing construction (due to GJS) applies solely to the case where $t = n$ and provides only computational privacy. In this paper, we further explore NPSS and present the following contributions.  \r\n\r\n1. **Definition.** We introduce a refined definition of information-theoretically secure NPSS. This notion can be seen as a cryptographic variant of standard NP-reductions and can be compiled into the GJS definition using any one-way function.\r\n\r\n2. **Construction.** We construct information-theoretic $t$-out-of-$n$ NPSS for any values of $t\\leq n$ with complexity polynomial in $n$. Along the way, we present a new notion of secure multiparty computation that may be of independent interest.\r\n\r\n3. **Applications.** Our NPSS framework enables the *non-interactive combination* of $n$ instances of zero-knowledge proofs, where only $t_s$ of them are sound and only $t_z$ are zero-knowledge, provided that $t_s + t_z > n$. Our combiner preserves various desirable properties, such as the succinctness of the proof. Building on this, we establish the following results under the minimal assumption of one-way functions: \r\n(i) *Standard NIZK implies NIZK in the Multi-String Model* (Groth and Ostrovsky, J. Cryptology, 2014), where security holds as long as a majority of the $n$ common reference strings were honestly generated. Previously, such a transformation was only known in the common random string model, where the reference string is uniformly distributed.\r\n(ii) A *Designated-Prover NIZK in the Multi-String Model*, achieving a strong form of two-round Multi-Verifier Zero-Knowledge in the honest-majority setting.\r\n(iii) A *three-round secure multiparty computation protocol* for general functions in the honest-majority setting. The round complexity of this protocol is optimal, resolving a line of research that previously relied on stronger assumptions (Aharonov et al., Eurocrypt'12; Gordon et al., Crypto'15; Ananth et al., Crypto'18; Badrinarayanan et al., Asiacrypt'20; Applebaum et al., TCC'22).",

    "abstract": "Multi-signatures allow a set of parties to produce a single signature for a common message by combining their individual signatures. The result can be verified using the aggregated public key that represents the group of signers. Very recent work by Lehmann and \u00d6zbay (PKC '24) studied the use of multi-signatures for ad-hoc privacy-preserving group signing, formalizing the notion of multi-signatures with probabilistic yet verifiable key aggregation. Moreover, they proposed new BLS-type multi-signatures, allowing users holding a long-term key pair to engage with different groups, without the aggregated key leaking anything about the corresponding group. This enables key-reuse across different groups in a privacy-preserving way. Unfortunately, their technique cannot be applied to Schnorr-type multi-signatures, preventing state-of-the-art multi-signatures to benefit from those privacy features.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we revisit the privacy framework from Lehmann and \u00d6zbay. Our first contribution is a generic lift that adds privacy to any multi-signature with deterministic key aggregation. As our second contribution, we study two concrete multi-signatures, and give dedicated transforms that take advantage of the underlying structures for improved efficiency. The first one is a slight modification of the popular MuSig2 scheme, achieving the strongest privacy property for free compared to the original scheme. The second is a variant of the lattice-based multi-signature scheme DualMS, making our construction the first post-quantum secure multi-signature for ad-hoc privacy-preserving group signing. The light overhead incurred by the modifications in our DualMS variant still allow us to benefit from the competitiveness of the original scheme.",

Crucially, the size of both messages and of the CRS is independent of the dimension of $\\mathbf{x}$.\r\n    We present a construction of OTE with optimal complexity from the standard learning with errors (LWE) problem. Then we show how this new technical tool enables a host of cryptographic primitives, all with security reducible to LWE, such as:\r\n1)Adaptively secure laconic function evaluation for depth-$D$ functions $f:\\{0, 1\\}^m\\rightarrow\\{0, 1\\}^\\ell$ with communication $m+\\ell+D\\cdot \\mathsf{poly}(\\lambda)$.\r\n2) A trapdoor hash function for all functions.\r\n3) An (optimally) succinct homomorphic secret sharing for all functions.\r\n4) A rate-$1/2$ laconic oblivious transfer for batch messages, which is best possible.\r\nIn particular, we obtain the first laconic function evaluation scheme that is adaptively secure from the standard LWE assumption, improving upon Quach, Wee, and Wichs (FOCS 2018). As a key technical ingredient, we introduce a new notion of adaptive lattice encodings, which may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Leakage-resilient secret sharing schemes are a fundamental building block for secure computation in the presence of leakage. As a result, there is a strong interest in building secret sharing schemes that combine resilience in practical leakage scenarios with potential for efficient computation. In this work, we revisit the inner-product framework, where a secret $y$ is encoded by two vectors $(\\omega, y)$, such that their inner product is equal to $y$. So far, the most efficient inner-product masking schemes (in which $\\omega$ is public but random) are provably secure with the same security notions (e.g., in the abstract probing model) as additive, Boolean masking, yet at the cost of a slightly more expensive implementation. Hence, their advantage in terms of theoretical security guarantees remains unclear, also raising doubts about their practical relevance. We address this question by showing the leakage resilience of inner-product masking schemes, in the bounded leakage threat model. It depicts well implementation contexts where the physical noise is negligible. In this threat model, we show that if $m$ bits are leaked from the $d$ shares $y$ of the encoding over an $n$-bit field, then with probability at least $1\u22122^{-\\lambda}$ over the choice of $\\omega$, the scheme is $O(\\sqrt{ 2^{\u2212(d\u22121)\u00b7n+m+2\\lambda}})$-leakage resilient. Furthermore, this result holds without assuming independent leakage from the shares, which may be challenging to enforce in practice. We additionally show that in large Mersenne-prime fields, a wise choice of the public coefficients $\\omega$ can yield leakage resilience up to $O(n \u00b7 2^{\u2212d\u00b7n+n+d})$, in the case where one physical bit from each share is revealed to the adversary. The exponential rate of the leakage resilience we put forward significantly improves upon previous bounds in additive masking, where the past literature exhibited a constant exponential rate only.",

    "abstract": "Constant-time (CT) is a popular programming discipline to protect\r\ncryptographic libraries against micro-architectural timing attacks.\r\nOne appeal of the CT discipline lies in its conceptual simplicity: a\r\nprogram is CT iff it has no secret-dependent data-flow,\r\ncontrol-flow or variable-timing operation. Thanks to its simplicity,\r\nthe CT discipline is supported by dozens of analysis tools. However, a\r\nrecent user study demonstrates that these tools are seldom used due to\r\npoor usability and maintainability (Jancar et al. IEEE SP 2022).\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce CT-LLVM, a CT analysis tool designed for\r\nusability, maintainability and automatic large-scale analysis. \r\nConcretely, CT-LLVM is packaged as a\r\nLLVM plugin and is built as a thin layer on top of two standard LLVM\r\nanalysis: def-use and alias analysis.  Besides confirming known CT\r\nviolations, we demonstrate the usability and scalability of CT-LLVM by\r\nautomatically analyzing nine cryptographic libraries.  On\r\naverage, CT-LLVM can automatically and soundly analyze 36% of the\r\nfunctions in these libraries, proving that 61% of them are CT.  In\r\naddition, the large-scale automatic analysis also reveals new\r\nvulnerabilities in these libraries.  In the end, we demonstrate\r\nthat CT-LLVM helps systematically mitigate compiler-introduced CT\r\nviolations, which has been a long-standing issue in CT analysis.",

The decomposed LWE problem can be interpreted as postulating the circular-security of a natural lattice-based public-key encryption scheme. To gain confidence in the assumption, we show that it is implied by the hardness of the succinct LWE problem of Wee (CRYPTO'24).",

    "abstract": "Updatable public-key encryption (UPKE) allows anyone to update a public key while simultaneously producing an update token, given which the secret key holder could consistently update the secret key. Furthermore, ciphertexts encrypted under the old public key remain secure even if the updated secret key is leaked -- a property much desired in secure messaging. All existing lattice-based constructions of UPKE update keys by a noisy linear shift. As the noise accumulates, these schemes either require super-polynomial-size moduli or an a priori bounded number of updates to maintain decryption correctness.\r\n\r\nInspired by recent works on cryptography based on the lattice isomorphism problem, we propose an alternative way to update keys in lattice-based UPKE. Instead of shifting, we rotate them. As rotations do not induce norm growth, our construction supports an unbounded number of updates with a polynomial-size modulus. The security of our scheme is based on the LWE assumption over hollow matrices -- matrices which generate linear codes with non-trivial hull -- and the hardness of permutation code equivalence. Along the way, we also show that LWE over hollow matrices is as hard as LWE over uniform matrices, and that a leftover hash lemma holds for hollow matrices.",

    "abstract": "A recent work by Boneh, Partap, and Rotem [Crypto'24] introduced the concept of traceable threshold encryption, in that if $t$ or more parties collude to construct a decryption box, which performs decryptions, then at least one party's identity can be traced by making a few black-box queries to the box. This has important applications, e.g., in blockchain mempool privacy, where collusion yields high financial gain through MEVs without any consequence - the possibility of tracing discourages collusion.\r\nNevertheless, their definitions leave room for exploitation as they only achieve CPA security and do not consider inconsistency in decryption via different participating sets.\r\n\r\nThis paper proposes stronger definitions of traceable threshold encryption, which supports CCA-security and consistency. Our main approach considers identity-based variants of traceable encryption (which we also define). It converts that to a CCA-secure construction, adapting two generic transformations, first using a one-time signature and then a fingerprinting code. \r\nWe put forward two efficient instantiations of our identity-based scheme with different merits: our first construction is based on Boneh-Franklin IBE [Crypto'01] and has constant size ciphertexts but quadratic size public keys - this is proven secure based on XDH and BDDH. Our second construction is based on Boneh-Boyen IBE [Eurocrypt'04]. It supports both constant-size ciphertexts and constant-size public keys - this is proven secure based on a variant of the uber assumption over bilinear pairings. Our concrete analysis shows that the first construction's ciphertext is much (~6x) smaller than the second construction. Finally, we extend the definitions to support consistency and achieve it by adjoining an efficient, non-interactive proof of correct encryption.",

    "abstract": "The fundamental assumption in $t$-out-of-$n$ threshold encryption is that the adversary can only corrupt less than $t$ parties. Unfortunately, it may be unfounded in practical scenarios where shareholders could be incentivized to collude. Boneh, Partap, and Rotem (Crypto'24) recently addressed the setting where $t$ or more shareholders work together to decrypt illegally. Inspired by the well-established notion of traitor tracing in broadcast encryption, they added a traceability mechanism that guarantees identifying at least one of the colluders. They provide several constructions that enable traceability, all of which require a trusted dealer to distribute the secret shares. While the trusted dealer can be replaced with a DKG for conventional threshold encryption, it is unclear how to do so without compromising traceability. As thresholdizing is meant to mitigate a single point of failure, a natural question that remains is: Can we construct an efficient traceable threshold encryption scheme that does not rely on a trusted party to distribute the secret shares? \r\n    In this paper, we achieve two dealerless traceable threshold encryption constructions with different merits by extending the PLBE primitive of Boneh et al. (Eurocrypt'06) and combining it with the silent setup threshold encryption construction of Garg et al. (Crypto'24). Our first construction achieves an amortized ciphertext of size $O(1)$ (for $O(n)$ ciphertexts). Our second construction achieves constant ciphertext size even in the worst case but requires a less efficient preprocessing phase as a tradeoff. Both our constructions enjoy a constant secret key size and do not require any interaction between the parties. \r\n    An additional restriction in the constructions of Boneh et al. is that they can only guarantee to find at least one colluder, leaving techniques to identify more traitors as an open problem. In this paper, we take a first step towards solving this question by formalizing a technique and applying it to our first construction. Namely, our first construction enables tracing $t$ traitors.",

    "abstract": "A key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) allows two parties to establish a shared secret key using only public communication. For post-quantum KEMs, the most widespread approach is to design a passively secure public-key encryption (PKE) scheme and then apply the Fujisaki\u2013Okamoto (FO) transform that turns any such PKE scheme into an IND-CCA secure KEM. While the base security requirement for KEMs is typically IND-CCA security, adversaries in practice can sometimes observe and attack many public keys and/or ciphertexts, which is referred to as multi-challenge security. FO does not necessarily guarantee multi-challenge security: for example, FrodoKEM, a Round 3 alternate in NIST\u2019s post-quantum project, used FO to achieve IND-CCA security, but was subsequently shown to be vulnerable to attackers that can target multiple ciphertexts. To avert this multi-ciphertext attack, the FrodoKEM team added a salt to the encapsulation procedure and proved that this does not degrade (single-ciphertext) IND-CCA security. The formal analysis of whether this indeed averts multi-ciphertext attacks, however, was left open, which we address in this work.\r\n\r\nFirstly, we formalize FrodoKEM's approach as a new variant of the FO transform, called the salted FO transform. Secondly, we give tight reductions from multi-challenge security of the resulting KEM to multi-challenge security of the underlying public key encryption scheme, in both the random oracle model (ROM) and the quantum-accessible ROM (QROM). Together these results justify the multi-ciphertext security of the salted FrodoKEM scheme, and can also be used generically by other schemes requiring multi-ciphertext security.",

    "abstract": "Generalized secret sharing (GSS), which can offer more flexibility by accommodating diverse access structures and conditions, has been under-explored in distributed computing over the past decades. To address the gaps, we propose the publicly verifiable generalized secret sharing (PVGSS) scheme, enhancing the applicability of GSS in transparent systems. Public verifiability is a crucial property to gain trustworthiness for decentralized systems like blockchain.  We begin by introducing two GSS constructions, one based on Shamir's secret sharing and the other on the linear secret sharing scheme (LSSS). Next, we present PVGSS schemes that combine GSS with non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proofs.  Further, we construct a decentralized exchange (DEX) based on PVGSS scheme, where any users can participate in exchanges and engage in arbitrage. Specifically, users can fairly swap ERC-20 tokens with passive watchers, who earn profits by providing arbitration services. The critical property of \"fairness\" required by the DEX is ensured through a sophisticated access structure, supported by the PVGSS scheme. We provide a comprehensive evaluation on the performance of the PVGSS schemes and the monetary costs for users in the DEX. The results demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of this approach in real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Proxy re-encryption (PRE) has been regarded as an effective cryptographic primitive in data sharing systems with distributed proxies. However, no literature considers the honesty of data owners, which is critical in the age of big data. In this paper, we fill the gap by introducing a new proxy re-encryption scheme, called publicly verifiable threshold PRE (PVTPRE). Briefly speaking, we innovatively apply a slightly modified publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) scheme to distribute the re-encryption keys to multiple proxies. Consequently, we achieve publicly verifiability of data owners non-interactively. Then, the correctness of data users in decryption and public verifiability of proxies in re-encryption are guaranteed seamlessly through execution of the PVSS reconstruction algorithms. We further prove that PVTPRE satisfies IND-CPA security. Besides, we put forward a privacy-preserving data rights confirmation framework by providing clear principles for data ownership and usage, based on the PVTPRE scheme and blockchain. Blockchain plays the role of data bank and smart contract engine, providing reliable storage and verification for all framework. To our knowledge, we are the first to systematically investigate data rights confirmation considering privacy as well as public verifiability, addressing the growing need for robust mechanisms to protect data rights and ensure transparency. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments to illustrate the correctness, feasibility and effectiveness. The experimental results show that our PVTPRE outperforms other PREs in many aspects.",

    "abstract": "With the growing emphasis on data privacy, secure multi-party computation has garnered significant attention for its strong security guarantees in developing privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) schemes. However, only a few works address scenarios with a large number of participants. The state of the art by Liu et al. (LXY24, USENIX Security'24) first achieves a practical PPML protocol for up to 63 parties but is constrained to semi-honest security. Although naive extensions to the malicious setting are possible, they would introduce significant overhead.\r\nIn this paper, we propose Helix, a scalable framework for maliciously secure PPML in the honest majority setting, aiming to enhance both the scalability and practicality of maliciously secure protocols. In particular, we report a privacy leakage issue in LXY24 during prefix OR operations and introduce a round-optimized alternative based on a single-round vectorized three-layer multiplication protocol. Additionally, by exploiting reusability properties within the computation process, we propose lightweight compression protocols that substantially improve the efficiency of multiplication verification. We also develop a batch check protocol to reduce the computational complexity of revealing operations in the malicious setting. For 63-party neural network inference, compared to the semi-honest LXY24, Helix is only 1.9$\\times$ (1.1$\\times$) slower in the online phase and 1.2$\\times$ (1.1$\\times$) slower in preprocessing under LAN (WAN) in the best case.",

    "abstract": "Existing secret management techniques demand users memorize complex passwords, store convoluted recovery phrases, or place their trust in a specific service or hardware provider. We have designed a novel protocol that combines existing cryptographic techniques to eliminate these complications and reduce user complexity to recalling a short PIN. Our protocol specifically focuses on a distributed approach to secret storage that leverages Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions (OPRFs) and a Secret-Sharing Scheme (SSS) combined with self-destructing secrets to minimize the trust placed in any singular server. Additionally, our approach allows for servers distributed across organizations, eliminating the need to trust a singular service operator. We have built an open-source implementation of the client and server sides of this new protocol, the latter of which has variants for running on commodity hardware and secure hardware.",

    "abstract": "We study efficient public randomness generation protocols in the PASSO (PArties Speak Sequentially Once) model for multi-party computation (MPC). PASSO is a variation of traditional MPC where $n$ parties are executed in sequence and each party ``speaks'' only once, broadcasting and sending secret messages only to parties further down the line. Prior results in this setting include information-theoretic protocols in which the computational complexity scales exponentially with the number of corruptions $t$ (CRYPTO 2022), as well as more efficient computationally-secure protocols either assuming a trusted setup phase or DDH (FC 2024). Moreover, these works only consider security against static adversaries.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we focus on computational security against adaptive adversaries and from minimal assumptions, and improve on the works mentioned above in several ways:\r\n\r\n- Assuming the existence of non-interactive perfectly binding commitments, we design protocols with $n=3t+1$ or $n=4t$ parties that are efficient and secure whenever $t$ is small compared to the security parameter $\\lambda$ (e.g., $t$ is constant). This improves the resiliency of all previous protocols, even those requiring a trusted setup. It also shows that $n=4$ parties are necessary and sufficient for $t=1$ corruptions in the computational setting, while $n=5$ parties are required for information-theoretic security.\r\n\r\n- Under the same assumption, we design protocols with $n=4t+2$ or $n=5t+2$ parties (depending on the adversarial network model) which are efficient whenever $t=poly(\\lambda)$. This improves on the existing DDH-based protocol both in terms of resiliency and the underlying assumptions.\r\n    \r\n- We design efficient protocols with $n=5t+3$ or $n=6t+3$ parties (depending on the adversarial network model) assuming the existence of one-way functions.\r\n\r\nWe complement these results by studying lower bounds for randomness generation protocols in the computational setting.",

    "abstract": "There is a heavy preference towards instantiating BGV and BFV homomorphic encryption schemes where the cyclotomic order $m$ is a power of two, as this admits highly efficient fast Fourier transformations. Field Instruction Multiple Data (FIMD) was introduced to increase packing capacity in the case of small primes and improve amortised performance, using reverse multiplication-friendly embeddings (RMFEs) to encode more data into each SIMD slot. However, FIMD currently does not admit bootstrapping.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we achieve bootstrapping for RMFE-packed ciphertexts with low capacity loss. We first adapt the digit extraction algorithm to work over RMFE-packed ciphertexts, by applying the recode map after every evaluation of the lifting polynomial. This allows us to follow the blueprint of thin bootstrapping, performing digit extraction on a single ciphertext. To achieve the low capacity loss, we introduce correction maps to the Halevi-Shoup digit extraction algorithm, to remove all but the final recode of RMFE digit extraction.\r\n\r\nWe implement several workflows for bootstrapping RMFE-packed ciphertexts in HElib, and benchmark them against thin bootstrapping for $m=32768$. Our experiments show that the basic strategy of recoding multiple times in digit extraction yield better data packing, but result in very low remaining capacity and latencies of up to hundreds of seconds. On the other hand, using correction maps gives up to $6$ additional multiplicative depth and brings latencies often below $10$ seconds, at the cost of lower packing capacity.",

    "abstract": "Falcon is one of post-quantum signature schemes selected by NIST for standardization. With the deployment underway, its implementation security is of great importance. In this work, we focus on the side-channel security of Falcon and our contributions are threefold.\r\n\r\nFirst, by exploiting the symplecticity of NTRU and a recent decoding technique, we dramatically improve the key recovery using power leakages within Falcon Gaussian samplers. Compared to the state of the art (Zhang, Lin, Yu and Wang, EUROCRYPT 2023), the amount of traces required by our attack for a full key recovery is reduced by at least 85%.\r\n\r\nSecondly, we present a complete power analysis for two exposed power leakages within Falcon\u2019s integer Gaussian sampler. We identify new sources of these leakages, which have not been identified by previous works, and conduct detailed security evaluations within the reference implementation of Falcon on Chipwhisperer.\r\n\r\nThirdly, we propose effective and easy-to-implement countermeasures against both two leakages to protect the whole Falcon\u2019s integer Gaussian sampler. Configured with our countermeasures, we provide security evaluations on Chipwhisperer and report performance of protected implementation. Experimental results highlight that our countermeasures admit a practical trade-off between effciency and side-channel security.",

    "abstract": "Non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) arguments allow a prover to convince a verifier about the truthfulness of an NP-statement by sending just one message, without disclosing any additional information. In several practical scenarios, the Fiat-Shamir transform is used to convert an efficient constant-round public-coin honest-verifier zero-knowledge proof system into an efficient NIZK argument system. This approach is provably secure in the random oracle model, crucially requires the programmability of the random oracle and extraction works through rewinds. The works of Lindell [TCC 2015] and Ciampi et al. [TCC 2016] proposed efficient NIZK arguments with non-programmable\r\nrandom oracles along with a programmable common reference string. In this work we show an efficient NIZK argument with straight-line simulation and extraction that relies on features that alone are insufficient to construct NIZK arguments (regardless of efficiency). More specifically we consider the notion of quasi-polynomial time simulation proposed by Pass in [EUROCRYPT 2003] and combine it with simulation and extraction with non-programmable random\r\noracles thus obtaining a NIZK argument of knowledge where neither the zero-knowledge simulator, nor the argument of knowledge extractor needs to program the random oracle. Still, both the simulator and the extractor are straight-line. Our construction uses as a building block a modification of the Fischlin\u2019s transform [CRYPTO 2005] and combines it with the concept of dense puzzles introduced by Baldimtsi et al. [ASIACRYPT 2016]. We also argue that our NIZK argument system inherits the efficiency features of Fischlin\u2019s transform, which represents the main advantage of Fischlin\u2019s protocol over existing schemes.",

    "abstract": "Blind signatures allow a user to obtain a signature from an issuer in a privacy-preserving way: the issuer neither learns the signed message, nor can link the signature to its issuance. The threshold version of blind signatures further splits the secret key among n issuers, and requires the user to obtain at least t \u2264 n of signature shares in order to derive the final signature. Security should then hold as long as at most t \u2212 1 issuers are corrupt. Security for blind signatures is expressed through the notion of one-more unforgeability and demands that an adversary must not be able to produce more signatures than what is considered trivial after its interactions with the honest issuer(s). While one-more unforgeability is well understood for the single-issuer setting, the situation is much less clear in the threshold case: due to the blind issuance, counting which interactions can yield a trivial signature is a challenging task. Existing works bypass that challenge by using simplified models that do not fully capture the expectations of the threshold setting. In this work, we study the security of threshold blind signatures, and propose a framework of one-more unforgeability notions where the adversary can corrupt c < t issuers. Our model is generic enough to capture both interactive and non-interactive protocols, and it provides a set of natural properties with increasingly stronger guarantees, giving the issuers gradually more control over how their shares can be combined. As a point of comparison, we reconsider the existing threshold blind signature models and show that their security guarantees are weaker and less clearly comprehensible than they seem. We then re-assess the security of existing threshold blind signature schemes \u2013 BLS-based and Snowblind \u2013 in our framework, and show how to lift them to provide stronger security.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we consider the setting where the process of securely evaluating a multi-party functionality is divided into two phases: offline (or preprocessing) and online. The offline phase is independent of the parties\u2019 inputs, whereas the online phase does require the knowledge of the inputs. We consider the problem of minimizing the round of communication required in the online phase and propose a round preserving compiler that can turn a big class of multi-party computation (MPC) protocols into protocols in which only the last two rounds are input-dependent. Our compiler can be applied to a big class of MPC protocols, and in particular to all existing round-optimal MPC protocols. All our results assume no setup and are proven in the dishonest majority setting with black-box simulation. As part of our contribution, we propose a new definition we call Multi-Party Computation with Adaptive-Input Selection, which allows the distinguisher to craft the inputs the honest parties should use during the online phase, adaptively on the offline phase. This new definition is needed to argue that not only are the messages of the offline phase input-independent but also that security holds even in the stronger (and realistic) adversarial setting where the inputs may depend on some of the offline-phase protocol messages. We argue that this is the definition that any protocol should satisfy to be securely used while preprocessing part of the rounds. We are the first to study this definition in a setting where there is no setup, and the majority of the parties can be corrupted. Prior definitions have been presented in the Universal Composable framework, which is unfortunately not well suited for our setting (i.e., no setup and dishonest majority). As a corollary, we obtain the first four-round (which is optimal) MPC protocol, where the first two rounds can be preprocessed, and its security holds against adaptive-input selection.",

    "abstract": "Multi-signatures allow to combine several individual signatures into a compact one and verify it against a short aggregated key. Compared to threshold signatures, multi-signatures enjoy non-interactive key generation but give up on the threshold-setting. Recent works by Das et al. (CCS'23) and Garg et al. (S&P'24) show how multi-signatures can be turned into schemes that enable efficient verification when an ad hoc threshold -- determined only at verification -- is satisfied. This allows to keep the simple key generation of multi-signatures and support flexible threshold settings in the signing process later on. Both works use the same idea of combining BLS multi-signatures with inner-product proofs over committed keys. Das et al. give a somewhat generic proof from both building blocks, which we show to be flawed, whereas Garg et al. give a direct proof for the combined construction in the algebraic group model.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we identify the common blueprint used in both works and abstract the proof-based approach through the building block of a commit-and-prove system for vectors (CP). We formally define a flexible set of security properties for the CP system and show how it can be securely combined with a multi-signature to yield a signature with ad hoc thresholds. Our scheme also lifts the threshold signatures into the multiverse setting recently introduced by Baird et al. (S&P'23), which allows signers to re-use their long-term keys across several groups. The challenge in the generic construction is to express -- and realize -- the combination of homomorphic proofs and commitments (needed to realize flexible thresholds over fixed group keys) and their simulation extractability (needed in the threshold signature security proof). We finally show that a CP instantiation closely following the ideas of Das et al. can be proven secure, but requires a new flexible-base DL-assumption to do so.",

    "abstract": "Efficient anonymous credentials are typically constructed by combining proof-friendly signature schemes with compatible zero-knowledge proof systems. Inspired by pairing-based proof-friendly signatures such as Boneh- Boyen (BB) and Boneh-Boyen-Shacham (BBS), we propose a wide family of lattice-based proof-friendly signatures based on variants of the vanishing short integer solution (vSIS) assumption [Cini-Lai-Malavolta, Crypto'23]. In particular, we obtain natural lattice-based adaptions of BB and BBS which, similar to their pairing-based counterparts, admit nice algebraic properties.\r\n\r\n    [Bootle-Lyubashevsky-Nguyen-Sorniotti, Crypto'23] (BLNS) recently proposed a framework for constructing lattice-based proof-friendly signatures and anonymous credentials, based on another new lattice assumption called $\\mathsf{ISIS}_f$ parametrised by a fixed function $f$, with focus on $f$ being the binary decomposition. We introduce a generalised $\\mathsf{ISIS}_f$ framework, called $\\mathsf{GenISIS}_f$, with a keyed and probabilistic function $f$. For example, picking $f_b(\\mu) = 1/(b-\\mu)$ with key $b$ for short ring element $\\mu$ leads to algebraic and thus proof-friendly signatures. To better gauge the robustness and proof-friendliness of $\\mathsf{(Gen)}\\mathsf{ISIS}_f$, we consider what happens when the inputs to $f$ are chosen selectively (or even adaptively) by the adversary, and the behaviour under relaxed norm checks. While bit decomposition quickly becomes insecure, our proposed function families seem robust.",

    "abstract": "Pulsars exhibit signals with precise inter-arrival times that are on the order of milliseconds to seconds depending on the individual pulsar. There is subtle variation in the timing of pulsar signals, primarily due to the presence of gravitational waves, intrinsic variance in the period of the pulsar, and errors in the realization of Terrestrial Time (TT). Traditionally, these variations are dismissed as noise in high-precision timing experiments. In this paper, we show that these variations serve as a natural entropy source for the creation of Random Number Generators (RNG). We also explore the effects of using randomness extractors to increase the entropy of random bits extracted from Pulsar timing data. To evaluate the quality of the Pulsar RNG, we model its entropy as a $k$-source and use well-known cryptographic results to show its closeness to a theoretically ideal uniformly random source. To remain consistent with prior work, we also show that the Pulsar RNG passes well-known statistical tests such as the NIST test suite.",

    "abstract": "A memory checker is an algorithmic tool used to certify the integrity of a database maintained on a remote, unreliable, computationally bounded server. Concretely, it allows a user to issue instructions to the server and after every instruction, obtain either the correct value or a failure (but not an incorrect answer) with high probability. A recent result due to Boyle, Komargodski, and Vafa (BKV, STOC '24) showed a tradeoff between the size of the local storage and the number of queries the memory checker makes to the server upon every logical instruction. Specifically, they show that every non-trivial memory checker construction with inverse-polynomial soundness and local storage at most $n^{1 - \\epsilon}$ must make $\\Omega(\\log n/ \\log \\log n)$ queries, and this is tight up to constant factors given known constructions. However, an intriguing question is whether natural relaxations of the security guarantee could allow for more efficient constructions. \r\n\r\nWe consider and adapt the notion of covert security to the memory checking context, wherein the adversary can effectively cheat while taking the risk of being caught with constant probability. Notably, BKV's lower bound does not apply in this setting. \r\n\r\nWe close this gap and prove that $\\Omega(\\log n/ \\log \\log n)$ overhead is unavoidable even in the covert security setting. Our lower bound applies to any memory checker construction, including ones that use randomness and adaptivity and ones that rely on cryptographic assumptions and/or the random oracle model, as long as they satisfy a natural \"read-only reads\" property. This property requires a memory checker not to modify contents of the database or local storage in the execution of a logical read instruction.",

    "abstract": "The vanishing short integer solution (vSIS) assumption [Cini-Lai-Malavolta, Crypto'23], at its simplest form, asserts the hardness of finding a polynomial with short coefficients which vanishes at a given random point. While  vSIS has proven to be useful in applications such as succinct arguments, not much is known about its theoretical hardness. Furthermore, without the ability to generate a hard instance together with a trapdoor, the applicability of vSIS is significantly limited.\r\n\r\nWe revisit the vSIS assumption focusing on the univariate single-point constant-degree setting, which can be seen as a generalisation of the (search) NTRU problem. In such a setting, we show that the vSIS problem is as hard as finding the shortest vector in certain ideal lattices. We also show how to generate a random vSIS instance together with a trapdoor, under the (decision) NTRU assumption. Interestingly, a vSIS trapdoor allows to sample polynomials of short coefficients which evaluate to any given value at the public point. By exploiting the multiplicativity of the polynomial ring, we use vSIS trapdoors to build a new homomorphic signature scheme for low-degree polynomials.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we explore the field of lattice-based Predicate Encryption (PE), with a focus on enhancing compactness and refining functionality.\r\n\r\nFirst, we present a more compact bounded collusion predicate encryption scheme compared to previous constructions, significantly reducing both the per-unit expansion and fixed overhead, while maintaining an optimal linear blow-up proportional to $Q$.\r\n\r\nNext, we propose a Predicate Inner Product Functional Encryption (P-IPFE) scheme based on our constructed predicate encryption scheme. P-IPFE preserves the attribute-hiding property while enabling decryption to reveal only the inner product between the key and message vectors, rather than the entire message as in traditional PE. Our P-IPFE scheme also achieves bounded collusion resistance while inheriting the linear compactness optimized in the underlying PE scheme. Additionally, it supports any polynomial-sized and bounded-depth circuits, thereby extending beyond the inner-product predicate class in prior works.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, all the proposed schemes achieve selective fully attribute-hiding security in the simulation-based model, therefore, can further attain semi-adaptive security by adopting existing upgrading techniques.",

    "abstract": "There has been remarkable progress in fully homomorphic encryption, ever since Gentry's first scheme.  In contrast, fully homomorphic authentication primitives received relatively less attention, despite existence of some previous constructions. While there exist various schemes with different functionalities for fully homomorphic encryption, there are only a few options for fully homomorphic authentication. Moreover, there are even fewer options when considering two of the most important properties: adaptive security, and pre-processable verification. To our knowledge, except for some concurrent works, achieving both properties requires the use of nested construction, which involves homomorphically authenticating a homomorphic authentication tag of a message, making the scheme costly and complicated.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose a dedicated scheme for (leveled) fully homomorphic message authentication code that is adaptively secure and has pre-processable verification. Leveraging the secrecy of the primitive, we demonstrate that a slight modification of a selectively secure (leveled) fully homomorphic signature scheme yields an adaptively secure (leveled) fully homomorphic message authentication code with pre-processable verification. Additionally, we introduce a novel notion and generic transform to enhance the security of a homomorphic message authentication code, which also exploits the secrecy of the primitive.",

    "abstract": "Considering security against quantum adversaries, while it is important to consider the traditional existential unforgeability (EUF-CMA security), it is desirable to consider security against adversaries making quantum queries to the signing oracle: Plus-one security (PO security) and blind unforgeability (BU security) proposed by Boneh and Zhandry (Crypto 2013) and Alagic et al. (EUROCRYPT 2020), respectively. Hash-and-sign is one of the most common paradigms for constructing EUF-CMA-secure signature schemes in the quantum random oracle model, employing a trapdoor function and a hash function. It is known that its derandomized version is PO- and BU-secure. A variant of hash-and-sign, known as hash-and-sign with retry (HSwR), formulated by Kosuge and Xagawa (PKC 2024), is widespread since it allows for weakening the security assumptions of a trapdoor function. Unfortunately, it has not been known whether HSwR can achieve PO- and BU-secure even with derandomization.\r\nIn this paper, we apply a derandomization with bounded loops to HSwR. We demonstrate that HSwR can achieve PO and BU security through this approach. Since derandomization with bounded loops offers advantages in some implementations, our results support its wider adoption, including in NIST PQC candidates.",

    "abstract": "Traitor tracing is a traditional cryptographic primitive designed for scenarios with multiple legitimate receivers. When the plaintext - that is, the output of decryption - is leaked and more than one legitimate receiver exists, it becomes imperative to identify the source of the leakage, a need that has motivated the development of traitor tracing techniques. Recent advances in standard encryption have enabled decryption outcomes to be defined in a fine-grained manner through the introduction of Functional Encryption (FE). Constructing FE schemes is intriguing, and achieving the tracing property adds an additional layer of complexity. Traitor tracing techniques have been actively developed for more than three decades, yet they have always remained within the same framework - a single sender responsible for encrypting all the data.\r\n\r\nHowever, fine-grained decryption is particularly useful when data originates from multiple sources, allowing for joint computation on personal data. This leads to the concept of multi-client functional encryption (MCFE), where multiple concurrent senders independently encrypt their data while agreeing on the decryption of a specific function (e.g., a statistical measure) computed on the aggregated data, without revealing any additional information. In the era of cloud computing and big data, privacy-preserving joint computation is crucial, and tracing the source of any breach by dishonest participants becomes essential. Thus, in this paper we take the first step toward addressing the tracing problem in the general context of joint computation with multiple senders. Our contributions are twofold:\r\n  - $\\textbf{Conceptually:}$ We propose the first tracing model in the context of multi-sender encryption, namely $\\textit{Traceable Multi-Client Functional Encryption}$ ($\\textsf{TMCFE}$), which allows a pirate to extract secret information from both receivers and senders. Our model supports strong and naturally admissible decoders, removing artificial restrictions on the pirate decoder and thus addressing the shortcomings of existing traceable functional encryption schemes designed for the single-sender setting.\r\n  - $\\textbf{Technically:}$ To achieve our conceptual objective, we build upon the recently introduced notion of strong admissibility for MCFE. Our main technical contribution is a generic compiler that transforms a large class of MCFE schemes with weak admissibility into schemes with strong admissibility. This compiler not only helps overcome existing challenges but may also be of general interest within the functional encryption domain. Finally, we present a concrete lattice-based scheme $\\textsf{TMCFE}$ for inner-product functionalities that achieves post-quantum security under standard assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Updatable Public-Key Encryption (UPKE) augments the security of PKE with Forward Secrecy properties. While requiring more coordination between parties, UPKE enables much more efficient constructions than full-fledged Forward-Secret PKE. Alwen, Fuchsbauer and Mularczyk (AFM, Eurocrypt\u201924) presented the strongest security notion to date. It is the first to meet the needs of UPKE\u2019s most important applications: Secure Group Messaging and Continuous Group Key Agreement. The authors provide a very efficient construction meeting their notion with classic security based on the Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption in the Random Oracle Model (ROM).\r\n\r\nIn this work we present the first post-quantum secure UPKE construction meeting (a slight relaxation of) the AFM security notion. Based on the Module LWE assumption, our construction is practically efficient. Moreover, public key sizes are about $1/2$ and ciphertext sizes around $2/3$ of those of the state-of-the-art lattice-based UPKE scheme in the ROM by Abou Haidar, Passel\u00e8gue and Stehl\u00e9 \u2013 despite only being shown to satisfy a significantly weaker security notion. As the AFM proofs relies on random self-reducibility of CDH, which has no analogue for lattices, we develop a new proof technique for strong UPKE, identifying the core properties required from the underlying (lattice-based) encryption scheme.",

    "abstract": "Lattice trapdoor algorithms allow us to sample hard random lattices together with their trapdoors, given which short lattice vectors can be sampled efficiently. This enables a wide range of advanced cryptographic primitives. In this work, we ask: can we distribute lattice trapdoor algorithms non-interactively?\r\n\r\nWe study a natural approach to sharing lattice trapdoors: splitting them into partial trapdoors for different lower-rank sublattices which allow the local sampling of short sublattice vectors. Given sufficiently many short sublattice vectors, these can then be combined to yield short vectors in the original lattice. Moreover, this process can be repeated an unbounded polynomial number of times without needing a party holding a full trapdoor to intervene. We further define one-wayness and indistinguishability properties for partial trapdoors.\r\n\r\nWe establish that such objects exist that have non-trivial performance under standard assumptions. Specifically, we prove these properties for a simple construction from the \u03ba-SIS and \u03ba-LWE assumptions, which were previously shown to be implied by the plain SIS and LWE assumptions, respectively. The security proofs extend naturally to the ring or module settings under the respective analogues of these assumptions, which have been conjectured to admit similar reductions.\r\n\r\nOur partial trapdoors achieve non-trivial efficiency, with relevant parameters sublinear in the number of shareholders. Our construction is algebraic, without resorting to generic tools such as multiparty computation or fully homomorphic encryption. Consequently, a wide range of lattice-trapdoor-based primitives can be thresholdised non-interactively by simply substituting the trapdoor preimage sampling procedure with our partial analogue.",

    "abstract": "In a secret sharing scheme with polynomial sharing, the secret is an element of a finite field, and the shares are obtained by evaluating polynomials on the secret and some random field elements, i.e., for every party there is a set of polynomials that computes the share of the party. These schemes generalize the linear ones, adding more expressivity and giving room for more efficient schemes. To identify the access structures for which this efficiency gain is relevant, we need a systematic method to identify the access structure of polynomial schemes; i.e., to identify which sets can reconstruct the secret in the scheme. As a first step, we study ideal polynomial secret sharing schemes where there is a single polynomial for each party. Ideal schemes have optimal share size because the size of each share is the size of the secret.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to generalize results of linear secret sharing schemes, i.e., schemes in which the shares are computed by applying linear mappings and the linear dependency of these mappings determines their access structures. To achieve this goal, we study the connection between the algebraic dependency of the sharing polynomials and the access structure of the polynomial scheme. Our first result shows that if the degree of the sharing polynomials is not too big compared to the size of the field, then the algebraic dependence of the sharing polynomials determines the access structure of the scheme. This contributes to the characterization of ideal polynomial schemes and establishes a new connection between families of ideal schemes and algebraic matroids. \r\n\r\nConversely, we ask the question: If we associate a polynomial with each party and the dealer, can we use these polynomials to realize the access structure determined by the algebraic dependency of the polynomials? Our second result shows that these access structures admit statistical schemes with small shares. Finally, we extend this result to the general case where each party may have more than one polynomial.",

    "abstract": "Secure two-party comparison, known as Yao's millionaires' problem, has been a fundamental challenge in privacy-preserving computation. It enables two parties to compare their inputs without revealing the exact values of those inputs or relying on any trusted third party. One elegant approach to secure computation is based on homomorphic encryption. Recently, building on this approach, Carlton et al. (CT-RSA 2018) and Bourse et al. (CT-RSA 2020) presented novel solutions for the problem of secure integer comparison. These protocols have demonstrated significantly improved performance compared to the well-known and frequently used DGK protocol (ACISP 2007 and Int. J. Appl. Cryptogr. 1(4),323\u2013324, 2009). In this paper, we introduce a class of higher residuosity attacks, which can be regarded as an extension of the classical quadratic residuosity attack on the decisional Diffie-Hellman problem. We demonstrate that the small RSA subgroup decision problems, upon which both the CEK and BST protocols are based, are not difficult to solve when the prime base $p_0$ is small (e.g., \\( p_0 < 100 \\)). Under these conditions, the protocols achieve optimal overall performance. Furthermore, we offer recommendations for precluding such attacks, including one approach that does not adversely affect performance. We hope that these attacks can be applied to analyze other number-theoretic hardness assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Anamorphic encryption (AE) considers secure communication in the presence of a powerful surveillant (typically called a ''dictator'') who only allows certain cryptographic primitives and knows all the secret keys in a system. The basic idea is that there is a second (anamorphic) mode of encryption that allows to transmit an anamorphic message using a double key to a receiver that can decrypt this message using a double key. From the point of view of the dictator the encryption keys as well as the ciphertexts in the regular and anamorphic mode are indistinguishable. The most recent works in this field consider public key anamorphic encryption (PKAE), i.e., the sender of an anamorphic message requires an encryption double key (or no key at all) and the receiver requires a decryption double key. Known constructions, however, either work only for schemes that are mostly of theoretical interest or come with conceptual limitations. \r\n\r\nIn this paper we ask whether we can design such PKAE schemes without such limitations and being closer to PKE schemes used in practice. In fact, such schemes are more likely to be allowed by a cognizant dictator. Moreover, we initiate the study of identity-based anamorphic encryption (IBAE), as the IBE setting seems to be a natural choice for a dictator. For both PKAE and IBAE, we show how well-known IND-CPA and IND-CCA secure primitives can be extended by an anamorphic encryption channel. In contrast to previous work, we additionally consider CCA (rather than just CPA) security notions for the anamorphic channel and also build upon CPA (rather than just CCA) secure PKE. \r\n\r\nFinally, we ask whether it is possible to port the recent concept of anamorphic signatures, which considers constructing symmetric anamorphic channels in case only signature schemes are allowed by the dictator, to the asymmetric setting, which we denote by public-key anamorphic signatures (PKAS). Also here we consider security beyond IND-CPA for the anamorphic channel.",

    "abstract": "Oblivious Transfer (OT) is a fundamental cryptographic primitive introduced nearly four decades ago. OT allows a receiver to select and learn $t$ out of $n$ private messages held by a sender. It ensures that the sender does not learn which specific messages the receiver has chosen, while the receiver gains no information about the remaining $n \u2212 t$ messages. In this work, we introduce the notion of functional OT (FOT), for the first time. FOT adds a layer of security to the conventional OT by ensuring that the receiver only learns a function of the selected messages rather than the $t$ individual messages themselves. We propose several protocols that realize this concept. In particular, we propose concrete instantiations of FOT when the function to be executed on the selected message is mean, mode, addition, or multiplication. The schemes are efficient and unconditionally secure. We also propose a non-trivial protocol that supports arbitrary functions on the selected messages mainly using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and oblivious linear function evaluation, where the number of FHE invocations is constant $O(1)$ with respect to $n$. Our asymptotic and concrete cost analyses demonstrate the efficiency of our unconditionally secure FOT protocols. FOT can enhance the security of privacy-preserving machine learning, particularly in (i) K-Nearest Neighbors schemes and (ii) client selection in Federated Learning (FL).",

    "abstract": "Following Ibukiyama, Katsura and Oort, all  principally polarized superspecial abelian surfaces over $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_p$ can be represented by a certain type of $2 \\times 2$ matrix $g$, having entries in the quaternion algebra $B_{p,\\infty}$. We present a heuristic polynomial-time algorithm which, upon input of two such matrices $g_1, g_2$, finds a \"connecting matrix\" representing a polarized isogeny of smooth degree between the corresponding surfaces. Our algorithm should be thought of as a two-dimensional analog of the KLPT algorithm from 2014 due to Kohel, Lauter, Petit and Tignol for finding a connecting ideal of smooth norm between two given maximal orders in $B_{p,\\infty}$. \r\n \r\nThe KLPT algorithm has proven to be a versatile tool in isogeny-based cryptography, and our analog has similar applications; we discuss two of them in detail. First, we show that it yields a polynomial-time solution to a two-dimensional analog of the so-called constructive Deuring correspondence: given a matrix $g$ representing a superspecial principally polarized abelian surface, realize the latter as the Jacobian of a genus-$2$ curve (or, exceptionally, as the product of two elliptic curves if it concerns a product polarization). Second, we show that, modulo a plausible assumption, Charles-Goren-Lauter style hash functions from superspecial principally polarized abelian surfaces require a trusted set-up. Concretely, if the matrix $g$ associated with the starting surface is known then collisions can be produced in polynomial time. We deem it plausible that all currently known methods for generating a starting surface indeed reveal the corresponding matrix. As an auxiliary tool, we present an explicit table for converting $(2,2)$-isogenies into the corresponding connecting matrix, a step for which a previous method by Chu required super-polynomial (but sub-exponential) time.",

    "abstract": "We initiate the study of {\\em split prover zkSNARKs}, which allow Alice to offload part of the zkSNARK computation to her assistant, Bob. In scenarios like online transactions (e.g., zCash), a significant portion of the witness (e.g., membership proofs of input coins) is often available to the prover (Alice) before the transaction begins. This setup offers an opportunity to Alice to initiate the proof computation early, even before the entire witness is available. The remaining computation can then be delegated to Bob, who can complete it once the final witness (e.g., the transaction amount) is known.\r\n\r\nTo prevent Bob from generating proofs independently (e.g., initiating unauthorized transactions), it is essential that the data provided to him for the second phase of computation does not reveal the witness used in the first phase. Additionally, the verifier of the zkSNARK should be unable to determine whether the proof was generated solely by Alice or through this two-step process. To achieve this efficiently, we require this two-phase proof generation to only use cryptography in a black-box manner.\r\n\r\nWe propose a split prover zkSNARK based on the Groth16 zkSNARKs [Groth, EUROCRYPT 2016], meeting all these requirements. Our solution is also \\emph{asymptotically tight}, meaning it achieves the optimal second phase proof generation time for Groth16. Importantly, our split prover zkSNARK preserves the verification algorithm of the original Groth16 zkSNARK, enabling seamless integration into existing deployments of Groth16.",

Unlike prior works, our counterexample is direct, it does not use heavy cryptographic machinery (such as obfuscation or witness encryption), and it applies to all variants of the assumption. Our counterexample can be seen as a \"zeroizing\" attack against evasive LWE, calling into question the soundness of the underlying design philosophy.",

    "abstract": "Evasive LWE (Wee, Eurocrypt 2022 and Tsabary, Crypto 2022) is a recently introduced, popular lattice assumption which has been used to tackle long-standing problems in lattice based cryptography. In this work, we develop new counter-examples against Evasive LWE, in both the private and public-coin regime, propose counter-measures that define safety zones, and finally explore modifications to construct full compact FE/iO. \r\n\r\nAttacks: Our attacks are summarized as follows.\r\n   - The recent work by Hseih, Lin and Luo [HLL23] constructed the first ABE for unbounded depth circuits by relying on the (public coin) ''circular'' evasive LWE assumption, which incorporates circularity into the Evasive LWE assumption. We provide a new attack against this assumption by exhibiting a sampler such that the pre-condition is true but post-condition is false.\r\n    - We demonstrate a counter-example against public-coin evasive LWE which exploits the freedom to choose the error distributions in the pre and post conditions. Our attack crucially relies on the error in the pre-condition being larger than the error in the post-condition. \r\n    - The recent work by Agrawal, Kumari and Yamada [AKY24a] constructed the first functional encryption scheme for pseudorandom functionalities ($\\mathsf{prFE}$) and extended this to obfuscation for pseudorandom functionalities ($\\mathsf{prIO}$) [AKY24c] by relying on private-coin evasive LWE. We provide a new attack against the stated assumption. \r\n    - The recent work by Branco et al. [BDJ+24] (concurrently to [AKY24c]) provides a construction of obfuscation for pseudorandom functionalities by relying on private-coin evasive LWE.  By adapting the counter-example against [AKY24a], we provide an attack against this assumption. \r\n    - Branco et al. [BDJ+24] showed that there exist contrived, somehow ''self-referential'', classes of pseudorandom functionalities for which pseudorandom obfuscation cannot exist. We develop an analogous result to the setting of pseudorandom functional encryption.\r\n\r\nWhile Evasive LWE was developed to specifically avoid zeroizing attacks as discussed above, our attacks show that in some (contrived) settings, the adversary may nevertheless obtain terms in the zeroizing regime.\r\n\r\nCounter-measures: Guided by the learning distilled from the above attacks, we develop counter-measures to prevent against them. Our interpretation of the above attacks is that Evasive LWE, as defined, is too general -- we suggest restrictions to identify safe zones for the assumption, using which, the broken applications can be recovered.\r\n\r\nVariants to give full FE and iO: Finally, we show that certain modifications of Evasive LWE, which respect the counter-measures developed above, yield full compact FE in the standard model. We caution that the main goal of presenting these candidates is as goals for cryptanalysis to further our understanding of this regime of assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Cryptographic group actions provide simple post-quantum generalizations to many cryptographic protocols based on the discrete logarithm problem (DLP). However, many advanced group action-based protocols do not solely rely on the core group action problem (the so-called vectorization problem), but also on variants of this problem, to either improve efficiency or enable new functionalities. In particular, the\r\nsecurity of the CSI-SharK threshold signature protocol relies on the Vectorization Problem with Shifted Inputs where (in DLP formalism) the adversary not only receives $g$ and $g^x$, but also $g^{xc}$ for multiple known values of $c$. A natural open question is then whether the extra data provided to the adversary in this variant allows for more efficient attacks. In this paper, we revisit the concrete quantum security of this problem. We start from a quantum multiple hidden shift algorithm of Childs and van Dam, which to the best of our knowledge was never applied in cryptography before. We specify algorithms for its subroutines and we provide concrete complexity estimates for both these subroutines and the overall algorithm.\r\n\r\nWe then apply our analysis to the CSI-SharK protocol. In prior analyses based on Kuperberg\u2019s algorithms, group action evaluations contributed to a significant part of the overall T-gate cost. For CSI-SharK suggested parameters, our new approach requires significantly fewer calls to the group action evaluation subroutine, leading to significant T-gate complexity improvements overall. We also show that the quantum security of the protocol decreases when the number of public keys increases, and quantify this degradation.\r\n\r\nBeyond its direct application to the CSI-Shark protocol, our work more generally questions the quantum security of vectorization problem variants, and it introduces the Childs-van Dam algorithm as a new quantum cryptanalysis tool.",

    "abstract": "Ongoing efforts to transition to post-quantum secure public-\r\nkey cryptosystems have created the need for algorithms with a variety of\r\nperformance characteristics and security assumptions. Among the can-\r\ndidates in NIST\u2019s post-quantum standardisation process for additional\r\ndigital signatures is FAEST, a Vector Oblivious Linear Evaluation in-the-\r\nHead (VOLEitH)-based scheme, whose security relies on the one-wayness\r\nof the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The VOLEitH paradigm\r\nenables competitive performance and signature sizes under conservative\r\nsecurity assumptions. However, since it was introduced recently, in 2023,\r\nits resistance to physical attacks has not yet been analysed. In this\r\npaper, we present the first security analysis of VOLEitH-based signa-\r\nture schemes in the context of side-channel and fault injection attacks.\r\nWe demonstrate four practical attacks on a masked implementation of\r\nFAEST in ARM Cortex-M4 capable of recovering the full secret key with\r\nhigh probability (greater than 0.87) from a single signature. These at-\r\ntacks exploit vulnerabilities of components specific to VOLEitH schemes\r\nand FAEST, such as the all-but-one vector commitments, VOLE gener-\r\nation, and AES proof generation. Finally, we propose countermeasures\r\nto mitigate these attacks and enhance the physical security of VOLEitH-\r\nbased signature schemes.",

Using this framework, we show that SQIsign is EUF-CMA secure in the ROM, assuming the hardness of the One Endomorphism problem with hints, or the hardness of the Full Endomorphism Ring problem with hints together with a hint indistinguishability assumption; all assumptions, unlike previous ones in the literature, are non-interactive.

    "abstract": "Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman published the RSA cryptosystem in 1978, which has been widely used over the last four decades.  The security of RSA is based on the difficulty of factoring large integers $N = pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers.  The public exponent $e$ and the private exponent $d$ are related by the equation  $ed - k(p-1)(q-1) = 1$. Recently, Cotan and Te{\\c{s}}eleanu (NordSec 2023) introduced a variant of RSA,  where the public exponent $e$ and the private exponent $d$ satisfy the equation  $ed - k(p^n-1)(q^n-1) = 1$ for some positive integer $n$.  In this paper, we study the general equation  $eu - (p^n - 1)(q^n - 1)v = w$ with positive integers $u$ and $v$, and $w\\in \\mathbb{Z}$. We show that, given the public parameters $N$ and $e$, one can recover $u$ and $v$ and factor the modulus $N$ in polynomial time by combining continued fractions with Coppersmith's algorithm which relies on lattice reduction techniques, under specific conditions on $u$, $v$, and $w$. Furthermore, we show that if the private exponent $d$ in an RSA-like cryptosystem is either small or too large, then $N$ can be factored in polynomial time. This attack applies to the standard RSA cryptosystem.",

    "abstract": "Lee et al. proposed a new bootstrapping algorithm based on homomorphic automorphism, which merges the empty sets of ciphertexts by adjusting the window size. This algorithm supports arbitrary secret key distributions with no additional runtime costs while using small evaluation keys. However, our implementation reveals that once the window size exceeds a certain threshold, the time required for bootstrapping remains relatively constant. This observation prompts the question of how to further reduce the running time.\r\nTo address this challenge, we introduce a new trick called Adaptive Key Update (AKU). With AKU and automorphism techniques, we propose a new bootstrapping algorithm for Gaussian secret keys that requires only \r\n$n$ external products and no switching for blind rotation. \r\nBuilding on this, we employ window size optimization and key switching techniques to further improve the algorithm. The improved algorithm provides a useful trade-off between key storage and computational efficiency, depending on the choice of the window size. \r\nCompared to the current fastest FHEW bootstrapping method for Gaussian secret keys (the LLWW+ method proposed by Li et al.), our AKU-based algorithm reduces the number of key switching by 76% and decreases the running time of bootstrapping by 20.7%. At this time, the practical runtime for bootstrapping is approximately equal to that of performing only $n$ external products.",

    "abstract": "CKKS is a homomorphic encryption (HE) scheme that supports arithmetic over complex numbers in an approximate manner. \r\nDespite its utility in PPML protocols, formally defining the security of CKKS-based protocols is challenging due to its approximate nature.\r\nTo be precise, in a sender-receiver model, where the receiver holds input ciphertexts and the sender evaluates its private circuit, it is difficult to define sender's privacy in terms of indistinguishability, whereas receiver's privacy is easily achieved through the semantic security of CKKS.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present a new definition for CKKS-based protocols, called Differentially Private Homomorphic Evaluation (DPHE) protocols, along with a general method to achieve this.\r\nIn our definition, we relax the sender\u2019s privacy condition from indistinguishability to differential privacy notion. \r\nWe focus on the fact that most security concern for PPML protocols is differential privacy on evaluation results, rather than the simulatability of the evaluation.\r\nWe prove that if the ideal functionality satisfies differential privacy and a protocol satisfies DPHE, then the output of the protocol also satisfies differential privacy.\r\n\r\nNext, we provide a general compiler that transforms a plain CKKS-based protocol into a DPHE one. \r\nWe achieve this by mixing the Laplace mechanism and zero-knowledge argument of knowledge (ZKAoK) for CKKS. \r\nThis approach allows us to achieve sender's privacy with a moderate noise, whereas the previous indistinguishability-based approach requires exponentially large overhead.\r\n\r\nFinally, we provide a concrete instantiation of ZKAoK for CKKS in the form of PIOP.\r\nTo prove the well-formedness of CKKS ciphertexts and public keys, we devise new proof techniques that use homomorphic evaluation during verification.\r\nWe also provide an implementation to demonstrate the practicality of our ZKAoK for CKKS by compiling PIOPs using the HSS polynomial commitment scheme (Crypto'24).",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of constructing efficient pseudorandom functions with Beyond-Birthday-Bound (BBB) security from blockciphers. More specifically, we are interested in variable-output-length pseudorandom functions (PRF) whose domain is twice that of the underlying blockcipher. We present two such constructions, $\\textsf{Pencil}$ and $\\sharp\\textsf{Pencil}$, which provide weak PRF and full PRF security, respectively, where both achieve full $n$-bit security. While several recent works have focused on constructing BBB PRFs from blockciphers, much less attention has been given to weak PRF constructions which can potentially be constructed more efficiently and still serve as a useful primitive. Another understudied problem in this domain, is that of extending the domain of a BBB PRF, which turns out to be rather challenging. Besides being of theoretical interest in itself, this is also a very practical problem. Often, the input to the BBB PRF is a nonce, but random nonces are much easier to handle in practice as they do not require maintaining state---which can be very cumbersome in distributed systems and encrypted cloud storage. Accordingly, in order to maintain a BBB security bound, one requires random nonces of size between $1.5n$ and $2n$ bits long and corresponding BBB (weak) PRF constructions that admit matching input sizes. NIST has recently announced a pre-draft call for comments to standardise AEAD schemes that can encrypt larger amounts of data and admit larger nonces. The call lists two approaches. The first is to define an analogue of GCM using a 256-bit blockcipher, and the second is based on a recent proposal by Gueron, to extend GCM with a key derivation function (KDF) called DNDK to increase its security. In essence, DNDK is a BBB-secure expanding weak pseudorandom function with a domain size of 192 bits that is realised from AES. Our work makes relevant contributions to this domain in two important ways. Firstly, an immediate consequence of our work is that one can construct a GCM analogue with BBB security from $\\sharp\\textsf{Pencil}$, without resorting to a 256-bit blockcipher. Our second contribution is that $\\sharp\\textsf{Pencil}$ can be used as a KDF in combination with GCM in an analogous manner to DNDK-GCM. However, $\\sharp\\textsf{Pencil}$ being a full PRF as opposed to DNDK which is only a weak PRF, allows one to prove the KDF-GCM composition secure as an AEAD scheme. Finally, when contrasting $\\textsf{Pencil}$ and DNDK as weak PRFs with comparable parameters, our construction requires only half the blockcipher calls.",

    "abstract": "In pairing-based cryptography, final exponentiation with a large fixed exponent is crucial for ensuring unique outputs in Tate and optimal Ate pairings. While optimizations for elliptic curves with even embedding degrees have been well-explored, progress for curves with odd embedding degrees, particularly those divisible by $3$, has been more limited. This paper presents new optimization techniques for computing the final exponentiation of the optimal Ate pairing on these curves. The first exploits the fact that some existing seeds have a form enabling cyclotomic cubing and extends this to generate new seeds with the same form. The second is to generate new seeds with sparse ternary representations, replacing squaring with cyclotomic cubing. The first technique improves efficiency by $1.7\\%$ and $1.5\\%$ compared to the square and multiply (\\textbf{SM}) method for existing seeds at $192$-bit and $256$-bit security levels, respectively. For newly generated seeds, it achieves efficiency gains of $3.6\\%$ at $128$-bit, $5\\%$ at $192$-bit, and $8.5\\%$ at $256$-bit security levels. The second technique  improves efficiency by $3.3\\%$ at $128$-bit, $19.5\\%$ at $192$-bit, and $4.3\\%$ at $256$-bit security levels.",

    "abstract": "S-boxes are the most popular nonlinear building blocks used in symmetric-key primitives. \r\n  Both cryptographic properties and implementation cost of an S-box are crucial for a good cipher design, especially for lightweight ones. \r\n  This paper aims to determine the exact minimum area of optimal 4-bit S-boxes (whose differential uniform and linearity are both 4) under certain standard cell library. \r\n  Firstly, we evaluate the upper and lower bounds upon the minimum area of S-boxes, by proposing a Prim-like greedy algorithm and utilizing properties of balanced Boolean functions to construct bijective S-boxes. \r\n  Secondly, an SAT-aided automatic search tool is proposed that can simultaneously consider multiple cryptographic properties such as the uniform, linearity, algebraic degree, and the implementation costs such as area, and gate depth complexity. \r\n  Thirdly, thanks to our tool, we manage to find the exact minimum area for different types of 4-bit S-boxes. \r\n  \r\n  The measurement in this paper uses the gate equivalent (GE) as standard unit under UMC 180 nm library, all 2/3/4-input logic gates are taken into consideration. \r\n  Our results show that the minimum area of optimal 4-bit S-box is 11 GE and the depth is 3. \r\n  If we do not use the 4-input gates, this minimum area increases to 12 GE and the depth in this case is 4, which is the same if we only use 2-input gates.\r\n  If we further require that the S-boxes should not have fixed points, the minimum area continue increasing a bit to 12.33 GE while keeping the depth. \r\n  Interestingly, the same results are also obtained for non-optimal 4-bit bijective S-boxes as long as their differential uniform $\\mathcal{U}(S) <16$ and linearity $\\mathcal{L}(S) < 8$ (i.e., there is no non-trivial linear structures) if only 2-input and 3-input gates are used. But the minimum area reduce to 9 GE if 4-input gates are involved.  \r\n  More strictly, if we require the algebraic degree of all coordinate functions of optimal S-boxes be 3, the minimum area is 14 GE with fixed point and 14.33 GE without fixed point, and the depth increases sharply to 8. \r\n  \r\nBesides determining the exact minimum area, our tool is also useful to search for a better implementation of existing S-boxes. As a result, we find out an implementation of Keccak's 5-bit S-box with 17 GE. As a contrast, the designer's original circuit has an area of 23.33 GE, while the optimized result by Lu et al. achieves an area of 17.66 GE. Also, we find out the first optimized implementation of SKINNY's 8-bit S-box with 26.67 GE.",

    "abstract": "A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) enables multiple parties to collectively manage digital assets in a blockchain setting. We focus on achieving fair exchange between DAOs using a cryptographic mechanism that operates with minimal blockchain assumptions and, crucially, does not rely on smart contracts.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, we consider a setting where a DAO consisting of $n_\\mathsf{S}$ sellers holding shares of a witness $w$ interacts with a DAO comprising $n_\\mathsf{B}$ buyers holding shares of a signing key $sk$; the goal is for the sellers to exchange $w$ for a signature under $sk$ transferring a predetermined amount of funds.  \r\nFairness is required to hold both between DAOs (i.e., ensuring that each DAO receives its asset if and only if the other does) as well as within each DAO (i.e., ensuring that all members of a DAO receive their asset if and only if every other member does).  \r\n\r\nWe formalize these fairness properties and present an efficient protocol for DAO-based fair exchange under standard cryptographic assumptions. Our protocol leverages certified witness encryption and threshold adaptor signatures, two primitives of independent interest that we introduce and show how to construct efficiently.",

    "abstract": "Indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) stands out as a powerful cryptographic primitive but remains notoriously difficult to realize under simple-to-state, post-quantum assumptions. Recent works have proposed lattice-inspired iO constructions backed by new \u201cLWE-with-hints\u201d assumptions, which posit that certain distributions of LWE samples retain security despite auxiliary information. However, subsequent cryptanalysis has revealed structural vulnerabilities in these assumptions, leaving us without any post-quantum iO candidates supported by simple, unbroken assumptions.\r\n\r\nMotivated by these proposals, we introduce the \\emph{Circular Security with Random Opening} (CRO) assumption\u2014a new LWE-with-hint assumption that addresses structural weaknesses from prior assumptions, and based on our systematic examination, does not appear vulnerable to known cryptanalytic techniques. In CRO, the hints are random ``openings'' of zero-encryptions under the Gentry--Sahai--Waters (GSW) homomorphic encryption scheme. Crucially, these zero-encryptions are efficiently derived from the original LWE samples via a special, carefully designed procedure, ensuring that the openings are marginally random. Moreover, the openings do not induce any natural leakage on the LWE noises.\r\nThese two features--- marginally random hints and the absence of (natural) noise leakage---rule out important classes of attacks that had undermined all previous LWE-with-hint assumptions for iO. Therefore, our new lattice-based assumption for iO provides a qualitatively different target for cryptanalysis compared to existing assumptions.\r\n\r\nTo build iO under this less-structured CRO assumption, we develop several new technical ideas. In particular, we devise an oblivious LWE sampling procedure, which succinctly encodes random LWE secrets and smudging noises, and uses a tailored-made homomorphic evaluation procedure to generate secure LWE samples. Crucially, all non-LWE components in this sampler, including the secrets and noises of the generated samples, are independently and randomly distributed, avoiding attacks on non-LWE components. \r\n\r\nIn the second part of this work, we investigate recent constructions of obfuscation for pseudorandom functionalities. We show that the same cryptanalytic techniques used to break previous LWE-with-hints assumptions for iO (Hopkins-Jain-Lin CRYPTO 21) can be adapted to construct counterexamples against the private-coin evasive LWE assumptions underlying these pseudorandom obfuscation schemes.\r\nUnlike prior counterexamples for private-coin evasive LWE assumptions, our new counterexamples take the form of zeroizing attacks, contradicting the common belief that evasive-LWE assumptions circumvent zeroizing attacks by restricting to ``evasive'' or pseudorandom functionalities.",

    "abstract": "A tuple of NP statements $(x_1, \\ldots, x_k)$ satisfies a monotone policy $P \\colon \\{0,1\\}^k \\to \\{0,1\\}$ if $P(b_1,\\ldots,b_k)=1$, where $b_i = 1$ if and only if $x_i$ is in the NP language. A monotone-policy batch argument (monotone-policy BARG) for NP is a natural extension of regular batch arguments (BARGs) that allows a prover to prove that $x_1, \\ldots, x_k$ satisfy a monotone policy $P$ with a proof of size $\\mathsf{poly}(\\lambda, |\\mathcal{R}|, \\log k)$, where $|\\mathcal{R}|$ is the size of the Boolean circuit computing the NP relation $\\mathcal{R}$.\r\n\r\nPreviously, Brakerski, Brodsky, Kalai, Lombardi, and Paneth (CRYPTO 2023) and Nassar, Waters, and Wu (TCC 2024) showed how to construct monotone-policy BARGs from (somewhere-extractable) BARGs for NP together with a leveled homomorphic encryption scheme (Brakerski et al.) or an additively homomorphic encryption scheme over a sufficiently-large group (Nassar et al.). In this work, we improve upon both works by showing that BARGs together with additively homomorphic encryption over any group suffices (e.g., over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$). For instance, we can instantiate the additively homomorphic encryption with the classic Goldwasser-Micali encryption scheme based on the quadratic residuosity (QR) assumption. Then, by appealing to existing compilers, we also obtain a monotone-policy aggregate signature scheme from any somewhere-extractable BARG and the QR assumption.",

    "abstract": "Oblivious Transfer (OT) is a significant two party privacy preserving cryptographic primitive. OT involves a sender having several pieces of information and a receiver having a choice bit. The choice bit represents the piece of information that the receiver wants to obtain as an output of OT. At the end of the protocol, sender remains oblivious about the choice bit and receiver remains oblivious to the contents of the information that were not chosen. It has applications ranging from secure multi-party computation, privacy-preserving protocols to cryptographic protocols for secure communication. Most of the classical OT protocols are based on number theoretic assumptions which are not quantum secure and existing quantum OT protocols are not so efficient and practical. Herein, we present the design and analysis of a simple yet efficient quantum OT protocol, namely qOT. qOT is designed by using the asymmetric key distribution proposed by Gao et al. [18] as a building block. The designed qOT requires only single photons as a source of a quantum state, and the measurements of the states are computed using single particle projective measurement. These make qOT efficient and practical. Our proposed design is secure against quantum attacks. Moreover, qOT also provides long-term security.",

    "abstract": "At Crypto 2021, May presented an algorithm solving the ternary Learning-With-Error problem, where the solution is a ternary vector $s\\in\\{0,\\pm 1\\}^{n}$ with a known number of $(+1)$ and $(-1)$ entries. This attack significantly improved the time complexity of $\\mathcal{S}^{0.5}$ from previously known algorithms to $\\mathcal{S}^{0.25}$, where $\\mathcal{S}$ is the size of the key space. Therefore, May exploited that using more representations, i.e., allowing ternary interim results with additional $(+1)$ and $(-1)$ entries, reduces the overall time complexity.\r\n\r\nLater, van Hoof et al. (PQCrypto 2021) combined May's algorithm with quantum walks to a new attack that performs in time $\\mathcal{S}^{0.19}$. However, this quantum attack requires an exponential amount of qubits. This work investigates whether the ternary LWE problem can also be solved using only $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ qubits. Therefore, we look closely into Dicke states, which are an equal superposition over all binary vectors with a fixed Hamming weight. Generalizing Dicke states to ternary vectors makes these states applicable to the ternary LWE problem.\r\n\r\nB\u00e4rtschi and Eidenbenz (FCT 2019) proposed a quantum circuit to prepare binary Dicke states deterministically in linear time $\\mathcal{O}(n)$. Their procedure benefits from the inductive structure of Dicke states, i.e., that a Dicke state of a particular dimension can be built from Dicke states of lower dimensions. Our work proves that this inductive structure is also present in generalized Dicke states with an underlying set other than $\\{0,1\\}^{n}$. Utilizing this structure, we introduce a new algorithm that deterministically prepares generalized Dicke states in linear time, for which we also provide an implementation in Qiskit.\r\n\r\nFinally, we apply our generalized Dicke states to the ternary LWE problem, and construct an algorithm that requires $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ qubits and classical memory space up to $\\mathcal{S}^{0.22}$. We achieve $\\mathcal{S}^{0.379}$ as best obtainable time complexity.",

    "abstract": "Secure multi-party computation (MPC) enables collaborative, privacy-preserving computation over private inputs. Advances in homomorphic encryption (HE), particularly the CKKS scheme, have made secure computation practical, making it well-suited for real-world applications involving approximate computations. However, the inherent approximation errors in CKKS present significant challenges in developing MPC protocols.\r\n\r\nThis paper investigates the problem of secure approximate MPC from CKKS. We first analyze CKKS-based protocols in two-party setting. When only one party holds a private input and the other party acts as an evaluator, a simple protocol with the noise smudging technique on the encryptor's side achieves security in the standard manner. When both parties have private inputs, we demonstrate that the protocol incorporating independent errors from each party achieves a relaxed standard security notion, referred to as a liberal security. Nevertheless, such a protocol fails to satisfy the standard security definition. To address this limitation, we propose a novel protocol that employs a distributed sampling approach to generate smudging noise in a secure manner, which satisfies the standard security definition. \r\n\r\nFinally, we extend the two-party protocols to the multi-party setting. Since the existing threshold CKKS-based MPC protocol only satisfies the liberal security, we present a novel multi-party protocol achieving the standard security by applying multi-party distributed sampling of a smudging error. \r\n\r\nFor all the proposed protocols, we formally define the functionalities and provide rigorous security analysis within the simulation-based security framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly define the functionality of CKKS-based approximate MPC and achieve formal security guarantees.",

    "abstract": "Differential cryptanalysis is a powerful technique for attacking block ciphers, wherein the Markov cipher assumption and stochastic hypothesis are commonly employed to simplify the search and probability estimation of differential trails. However, these assumptions often neglect inherent algebraic constraints, potentially resulting in invalid trails and inaccurate probability estimates. Some studies identified violations of these assumptions and explored how they impose constraints on key material, but they have not yet fully captured all relevant ones. This study proposes Trail-Estimator, an automated verifier for differential trails on block ciphers, consisting of two parts: a constraint detector Cons-Collector and a solving tool Cons-Solver. We first establish the fundamental principles that will allow us to systematically identify all constraint subsets within a differential trail, upon which Cons-Collector is built. Then, Cons-Solver utilizes specialized preprocessing techniques to efficiently solve the detected constraint subsets, thereby determining the key space and providing a comprehensive probability distribution of differential trails. To validate its effectiveness, Trail-Estimator is applied to verify 14 differential trails for the SKINNY, LBLOCK, and TWINE block ciphers. Experimental results show that Trail-Estimator consistently identifies previously undetected constraints for SKINNY and discovers constraints for the first time for LBLOCK and TWINE. Notably, it is the first tool to discover long nonlinear constraints extending beyond five rounds in these ciphers. Furthermore, Trail-Estimator's accuracy is validated by experiments showing its predictions closely match the real probability distribution of short-round differential trails.",

    "note": "On 2025-02-21, Kuchta, LeGrow and Persichetti ([KLP25]) proposed a construction of blind signatures from matrix code equivalence ( https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/274). The framework also follows that in CSI-Otter, with a focus on matrix code equivalence. To resolve issues caused by non-commutativity, the authors make use of the actions of both $A$ and its inverse transpose $A^{-T}$ for an invertible matrix $A$, and require $A$ to be (anti)symmetric. The security of the scheme relies on  the hardness assumption of the Modified Inverse Matrix Code Equivalence Problem (MIMCE), a computational version of Inverse Matrix Code Equivalence Problem (IMCE). IMCE was recently attacked by Budroni et al. ([BCDSK24]) (Asiacrypt'24, https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/244), and this attack was not discussed in [KLP25].\r\n\r\nIn contrast, our framework is applicable for general (non-commutative) group actions. One requirement for instantiating our scheme is the reuse of secret keys, which leads us to propose the use of symmetric group action to equivalence classes of linear codes under the action of general linear group and diagonal group. This viewpoint helps to thwart the attack of reusing keys as in [BCDSK24].",

    "abstract": "Abdalla et al. (ASIACRYPT 2020) introduced a notion of identity-based inner-product functional encryption (IBIPFE) that combines identity-based encryption and inner-product functional encryption (IPFE). Thus far, several pairing-based and lattice-based IBIPFE schemes have been proposed. However, there are two open problems. First, there are no known IBIPFE schemes that satisfy the adaptive simulation-based security. Second, known IBIPFE schemes that satisfy the adaptive indistinguishability-based security or the selective simulation-based security do not have tight reductions. In this paper, we propose lattice-based and pairing-based IBIPFE schemes that satisfy the tight adaptive simulation-based security. At first, we propose a generic transformation from an indistinguishability-based secure $(L + 1)$-dimensional (IB)IPFE scheme to a simulation-based secure $L$-dimensional (IB)IPFE scheme. The proposed transformation improves Agrawal et al.'s transformation for plain IPFE (PKC 2020) that requires an indistinguishability-based secure $2L$-dimensional scheme. Then, we construct a lattice-based IBIPFE scheme that satisfies the tight adaptive indistinguishability-based security under the LWE assumption in the quantum random oracle model. We apply the proposed transformation and obtain the first lattice-based IBIPFE scheme that satisfies adaptive simulation-based security. Finally, we construct a pairing-based IBIPFE scheme that satisfies the tight adaptive simulation-based security under the DBDH assumption in the random oracle model. The pairing-based scheme does not use the proposed transformation towards the best efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The concept of anamorphic encryption, first formally introduced by Persiano et al. in their influential 2022 paper titled ``Anamorphic Encryption: Private Communication Against a Dictator,'' enables embedding covert messages within ciphertexts. One of the key distinctions between a ciphertext embedding a covert message and an original ciphertext, compared to an anamorphic ciphertext, lies in the indistinguishability between the original ciphertext and the anamorphic ciphertext. This encryption procedure has been defined based on a public-key cryptosystem. Initially, we present a quantum analogue of the classical anamorphic encryption definition that is based on public-key encryption. Additionally, we introduce a definition of quantum anamorphic encryption that relies on symmetric key encryption. Furthermore, we provide a detailed generalized construction of quantum anamorphic symmetric key encryption within a general framework, which involves taking any two quantum density matrices of any different dimensions and constructing a single quantum density matrix, which is the quantum anamorphic ciphertext containing ciphertexts of both of them. Subsequently, we introduce a definition of computational anamorphic secret-sharing and extend the work of \\c{C}akan et al. on computational quantum secret-sharing to computational quantum anamorphic secret-sharing, specifically addressing scenarios with multiple messages, multiple keys, and a single share function. This proposed secret-sharing scheme demonstrates impeccable security measures against quantum adversaries.",

    "abstract": "Cryptographic group actions have attracted growing attention as a useful tool for constructing cryptographic schemes. \r\nAmong their applications, commitment schemes are particularly interesting as fundamental primitives, playing a crucial role in protocols such as zero-knowledge proofs, multi-party computation, and more.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel framework to construct commitment schemes based on cryptographic group actions. \r\nSpecifically, we propose two key techniques for general group actions: re-randomization and randomness extraction. \r\nRoughly speaking, a re-randomization algorithm introduces randomness within an orbit for any input element, while a randomness extractor maps this randomness to uniformity over the message space.\r\nWe demonstrate that these techniques can significantly facilitate the construction of commitment schemes, providing a flexible framework for constructing either perfectly hiding or perfectly binding commitments, depending on the type of extractor involved. \r\nMoreover, we extend our framework to support the construction of commitments with additional desirable properties beyond hiding and binding, such as dual-mode commitments and enhanced linkable commitments. \r\nThese extensions are achieved by further adapting the extractor to satisfy trapdoor or homomorphic properties.\r\nFinally, we instantiate all our proposed commitment schemes using lattices, specifically leveraging the lattice isomorphism problem (LIP) and the lattice automorphism problem (LAP) as underlying cryptographic assumptions. \r\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first commitment scheme construction based on LIP/LAP. \r\nAdditionally, we use LIP to provide a repair and improvement to the tensor isomorphism-based non-interactive commitment scheme proposed by D'Alconzo, Flamini, and Gangemi (ASIACRYPT 2023), which was recently shown to be insecure by an attack from Gilchrist, Marco, Petit, and Tang (CRYPTO 2024).",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present the first practical algorithm to compute an effective group action of the class group of any imaginary quadratic order $\\mathcal{O}$ on a set of supersingular elliptic curves primitively oriented by $\\mathcal{O}$. Effective means that we can act with any element of the class group directly, and are not restricted to acting by products of ideals of small norm, as for instance in CSIDH. Such restricted effective group actions often hamper cryptographic constructions, e.g. in signature or MPC protocols.\r\n\r\nOur algorithm is a refinement of the Clapoti approach by Page and Robert, and uses $4$-dimensional isogenies. As such, it runs in polynomial time, does not require the computation of the structure of the class group, nor expensive lattice reductions, and our refinements allows it to be instantiated with the orientation given by the Frobenius endomorphism. This makes the algorithm practical even at security levels as high as CSIDH-4096. Our implementation in SageMath takes 1.5s to compute a group action at the CSIDH-512 security level, 21s at CSIDH-2048 level and around 2 minutes at the CSIDH-4096 level. This marks the first instantiation of an effective cryptographic group action at such high security levels. For comparison, the recent KLaPoTi approach requires around 200s at the CSIDH-512 level in SageMath and 2.5s in Rust.",

    "abstract": "Differential cryptanalysis, along with its variants such as boomerang attacks, is widely used to evaluate the security of block ciphers. These cryptanalytic techniques often rely on assumptions like the \\textit{hypothesis of stochastic equivalence} and \\textit{Markov ciphers assumption}. Recently, more attention has been paid to verifying whether differential characteristics (DCs) meet these assumptions, finding both positive and negative results.\r\nA part of these efforts includes the automatic search methods for both the value and difference propagation (e.g., Liu et al. CRYPTO 2020, Nageler et al. ToSC 2025/1), structural constraints analysis (e.g., Tan and Peyrin, ToSC 2022/4), and the quasidifferential (Beyne and Rijmen, CRYPTO 2022).  \r\nNevertheless, less attention has been paid to the related-key DCs and boomerang distinguishers, where the same assumptions are used. To the best of our knowledge, only some related-tweakey DCs of \\skinny were checked thanks to its linear word-based key-schedule, and no similar work is done for boomerang distinguishers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe verification of related-key DCs and boomerang distinguishers is as important as that of DCs, as they often hold the longest attack records for block ciphers.\r\nThis paper focuses on investigating the validity of DCs in the related-key setting and boomerang distinguishers in both single- and related-key scenarios.\r\nFor this purpose, we generalize Beyne and Rijmen's quasidifferential techniques for the related-key DCs and boomerang attacks.\r\n\r\nFirst, to verify related-key DCs, the related-key quasi-DC is proposed. Similar to the relationship between the quasi-DC and DC, the exact probability of a related-key DC is equal to the sum of all corresponding related-key quasi-DCs' correlations.\r\nSince the related-key quasi-DCs involve the key information, we can determine the probability of the target related-key DC in different key subspaces. \r\nWe find both positive and negative results.\r\nFor example, we verify the 18-round related-key DC used in the best attack on \\gift-64 whose probability is $2^{-58}$, finding that this related-key DC has a higher probability for $2^{128} \\times (2^{-5} + 2^{-8})$ keys which is around $2^{-50}$, but it is impossible for the remaining keys.\r\n\r\nSecond, we identify proper bases to describe the boomerang distinguishers with the geometric approach. A quasi-BCT is constructed to consider the value influence in the boomerang connectivity table (BCT). For the DC parts, the quasi-biDDT is used. Connecting the quasi-BCT and quasi-biDDT, we can verify the probability of a boomerang distinguisher with quasi-boomerang characteristics. \r\nThis also allows us to analyze the probability of the boomerang in different key spaces. \r\nFor a 17-round boomerang distinguisher of \\skinny-64-128 whose probability is $2^{-50}$, we find that the probability can be $2^{-44}$ for half of keys, and impossible for the other half.",

    "abstract": "In the past three decades, we have witnessed the creation of various cryptanalytic attacks. However, relatively little research has been done on their potential underlying connections. The geometric approach, developed by Beyne in 2021, shows that a cipher can be viewed as a linear operation when we treat its input and output as points in an induced \\textit{free vector space}.\r\nBy performing a change of basis for the input and output spaces, one can obtain various transition matrices. Linear, differential, and (ultrametic) integral attacks have been well reinterpreted by Beyne's theory in a unified way.\r\n\r\nThus far, the geometric approach always uses the same basis for the input and output spaces. We observe here that this restriction is unnecessary and allowing different bases makes the geometric approach more flexible and able to interpret/predict more attack types. Given some set of bases for the input and output spaces, a family of basis-based attacks is defined by combining them, and all attacks in this family can be studied in a unified automatic search method. \r\n\r\nWe revisit three kinds of bases from previous geometric approach papers and extend them to four extra ones by introducing new rules when generating new bases. With the final seven bases, we can obtain $7^{2d}$ different basis-based attacks in the $d$-th order spaces, where the \\textit{order} is defined as the number of messages used in one sample during the attack. \r\n\r\nWe then provide four examples of applications of this new framework. First, we show that by choosing a better pair of bases, Beyne and Verbauwhede's ultrametric integral cryptanalysis can be interpreted as a single element of a transition matrix rather than as a linear combination of elements. This unifies the ultrametric integral cryptanalysis with the previous linear and quasi-differential attacks.\r\nSecond, we revisit the multiple-of-$n$ property with our refined geometric approach and exhibit new multiple-of-$n$ distinguishers that can reach more rounds of the \\skinny-64 cipher than the state-of-the-art.\r\nThird, we study the multiple-of-$n$ property for the first-order case, which is similar to the subspace trail but it is the divisibility property that is considered. This leads to a new distinguisher for 11-round-reduced \\skinny-64. \r\nFinally, we give a closed formula for differential-linear approximations without any assumptions, even confirming that the two differential-linear approximations of \\simeck-32 and \\simeck-48 found by Hadipour \\textit{et al.} are deterministic independently of concrete key values.  \r\nWe emphasize that all these applications were not possible before.",

    "abstract": "We present a new generalization of (zk-)SNARKs combining two additional features at the same time. Besides the verification of correct computation, our new SNARKs also allow, first, the verification of input data authenticity. Specifically, a verifier can confirm that the input to the computation originated from a trusted source. Second, our SNARKs support verification of stateful computations across multiple rounds, ensuring that the output of the current round correctly depends on the internal state of the previous round. Our SNARKs are specifically suited to applications in cyber-physical control systems, where computations are periodically carried out and need to be checked immediately. Our focus is on concrete practicality, so we abstain from arithmetizing hash functions or signatures in our SNARKs. Rather, we modify the internals of an existing SNARK to extend its functionality. Additionally, we present new optimizations to reduce proof size, prover time, and verification time in our setting. With our construction, prover runtime improves significantly over the baseline by a factor of 89. Verification time is 70 % less for computations on authenticated data and 33 % less for stateful computations. To demonstrate relevance and practicality, we implement and benchmark our new SNARKs in a sample real-world scenario with\r\na (simple) quadcopter flight control system.",

    "abstract": "Distributed randomness beacon protocols, which generate publicly verifiable randomness at regular intervals, are crucial for a wide range of applications. The publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) scheme is a promising cryptographic primitive for implementing beacon protocols, such as Hydrand (S\\&P '20) and SPURT (S\\&P '22). However, two key challenges for practical deployment remain unresolved: asynchrony and reconfiguration. In this paper, we introduce the $AsyRand$ beacon protocol to address these challenges. In brief, $AsyRand$ leverages Bracha Reliable Broadcast (BRB) or BRB-like protocols for message dissemination and incorporates a producer-consumer model to decouple the production and consumption of PVSS commitments.  In the producer-consumer model, PVSS commitments are produced and consumed using a queue data structure. Specifically, the producer process is responsible for generating new PVSS commitments and reaching consensus on them within the queue, while the consumer process continuously consumes the commitments to recover PVSS secrets and generate new beacon values. This separation allows the producer and consumer processes to operate simultaneously and asynchronously, without the need for a global clock. Moreover, the producer-consumer model enables each party to detect potential faults in other parties by monitoring the queue length. If necessary, parties in $AsyRand$ can initiate a removal process for faulty parties. BRB is also employed to facilitate the addition of new parties without requiring a system restart. In summary, $AsyRand$ supports reconfiguration, enhancing both the protocol's usability and reliability. Additionally, we propose a novel PVSS scheme based on the $\\Sigma$ protocol, which is of independent interest. Regarding complexity, $AsyRand$ achieves state-of-the-art performance with $O(n^2)$ communication complexity, $O(n)$ computation complexity, and $O(n)$ verification complexity.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first DABE construction (beyond hierarchical identity-based encryption) that achieves full security without relying on complexity leveraging. Our DABE supports an unbounded number of key delegations, and the secret key size grows just linearly with each key delegation operation.",

    "abstract": "Hiding the metadata in Internet protocols serves to protect user privacy, dissuade traffic analysis, and prevent network ossification. Fully encrypted protocols require even the initial key exchange to be obfuscated: a passive observer should be unable to distinguish a protocol execution from an exchange of random bitstrings. Deployed obfuscated key exchanges such as Tor's pluggable transport protocol obfs4 are Diffie\u2013Hellman-based, and rely on the Elligator encoding for obfuscation. Recently, G\u00fcnther, Stebila, and Veitch (CCS '24) proposed a post-quantum variant pq-obfs, using a novel building block called obfuscated key encapsulation mechanisms (OKEMs): KEMs whose public keys and ciphertexts look like random bitstrings.\r\n\r\nFor transitioning real-world protocols, pure post-quantum security is not enough. Many are taking a hybrid approach, combining traditional and post-quantum schemes to hedge against security failures in either component. While hybrid KEMs are already widely deployed (e.g., in TLS 1.3), existing hybridization techniques fail to provide hybrid obfuscation guarantees for OKEMs. Further, even if a hybrid OKEM existed, the pq-obfs protocol would still not achieve hybrid obfuscation.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we address these challenges by presenting the first OKEM combiner that achieves hybrid IND-CCA security with hybrid ciphertext obfuscation guarantees, and using this to build Drivel, a modification of pq-obfs that is compatible with hybrid OKEMs. Our OKEM combiner allows for a variety of practical instantiations, e.g., combining obfuscated versions of DHKEM and ML-KEM. We additionally provide techniques to achieve unconditional public key obfuscation for LWE-based OKEMs, and explore broader applications of hybrid OKEMs, including a construction of the first hybrid password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocol secure against adaptive corruptions in the UC model.",

    "abstract": "Threshold fully homomorphic encryption (ThFHE) is an extension of FHE that can be applied to multiparty computation (MPC) with low round complexity. Recently, Passel\u00e8gue and Stehl\u00e9 (Asiacrypt 2024) presented a simulation-secure ThFHE scheme with polynomially small decryption shares from \u201cyet another\u201d learning with errors assumption (LWE), in which the norm of the secret key is leaked to the adversary. While \u201cyet another\u201d LWE is reduced from standard LWE, its module variant, \u201cyet another\u201d module-LWE (MLWE), lacks a known reduction from standard MLWE. Because of this, it is left as an open question to extend their scheme to the MLWE-based construction.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we address this open problem: we propose a simulation-secure ThFHE scheme with polynomially small decryption shares whose security is (directly) reduced from standard LWE/MLWE. Our core technique, which we call \u201cnoise padding\u201d, eliminates the need of \u201cyet another\u201d assumptions: we distribute shares of a small error and use them to adjust the distribution of decryption noise so that no information about the secret key is leaked. As side benefits of our construction, our ThFHE efficiently realizes arbitrary T-out-of-N threshold decryption via simple Shamir secret sharing instead of {0, 1}-linear secret sharing. Furthermore, the sizes of keys, ciphertexts and decryption shares in our scheme are constant w.r.t. the number of parties N ; we achieve compactness w.r.t. N.",

    "abstract": "The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol standard proposes a novel tree-based protocol that enables efficient end-to-end encrypted messaging over large groups with thousands of members. Its functionality can be divided into three components: TreeSync for authenticating and synchronizing group state, TreeKEM for the core group key agreement, and TreeDEM for group message encryption. While previous works have analyzed the security of abstract models of TreeKEM, they do not account for the precise low-level details of the protocol standard. This work presents the first machine-checked security proof for TreeKEM. Our proof is in the symbolic Dolev-Yao model and applies to a bit-level precise, executable, interoperable specification of the protocol. Furthermore, our security theorem for TreeKEM composes naturally with a previous result for TreeSync to provide a strong modular security guarantee for the published MLS standard.",

    "abstract": "We examine the post-quantum security of the Ascon authenticated encryption (AE) mode. In spite of comprehensive research of Ascon's classical security, the potential impact of quantum adversaries on Ascon has not yet been explored much. We investigate the generic security of the Ascon AE mode in the setting where the adversary owns a quantum computer to improve its attack, while the adversarial encryption or decryption queries are still classical. In this so-called Q1 model, Ascon achieves security up to approximately $\\min\\{2^{c/3},2^{k/2}\\}$ evaluations, where $c$ is the capacity, $k$ the key size, and the adversary is block-wise adaptive but restricted to one forgery attempt. Our technique is based on applying the semi-classical one-way to hiding (O2H) lemma, and on tailoring the puncture set to the Ascon mode.\r\nAdditionally, we discuss different parameter choices for Ascon and compare our results to generic quantum attacks, such as Grover-based key search and state recovery.",

    "abstract": "Decentralization is a great enabler for adoption of modern cryptography in real-world systems. Widespread adoption of blockchains and secure multi-party computation protocols are perfect evidentiary examples for dramatic rise in deployment of decentralized cryptographic systems. Much of cryptographic research can be viewed as reducing (or eliminating) the dependence on trusted parties, while shielding from stronger adversarial threats. In this work, we study the problem of multi-authority functional encryption (MAFE), a popular decentralized generalization of functional encryption (FE). Our main contributions are:\r\n\r\n    1. We design MAFE for all poly-sized circuits, in the bounded collusion model, under the minimal assumption of PKE/OWFs. Prior to our work, this required either sub-exponentially secure obfuscation, or $\\log n$-party key exchange, or Random Oracles and sub-exponentially secure PKE. We also extend our constructions to the dynamic collusion model under the minimal assumptions of IBE/OWFs. Unlike all prior works, our MAFE systems are truly dynamic and put no restrictions on the maximum number of authorities.\r\n\r\n    2. Under the hardness of learning with errors (LWE) assumption, we design MAFE for all poly-sized circuits where we allow adversaries to adaptively corrupt local authorities. We allow an adversary to corrupt any $k$ out of $n$ local authorities as long as ${{n}\\choose{k}}$ = poly$(\\lambda)$. Prior to this, such MAFE relied on sub-exponentially secure obfuscation. Additionally, we design a new MAFE compiler for boosting selective authority corruptions to non-adaptive authority corruptions.\r\n\r\n    3. We prove a tight implication from MAFE to (VBB/indistinguishability) obfuscation. We show that MAFE implies obfuscation only if the number of attribute bits (jointly) controlled by all corrupt local authorities is $\\omega(\\log \\lambda)$. This proves optimality of our second result for a wide range of parameters.\r\n\r\n    4. Finally, we propose a new MAFE system that we refer to as multi-authority attribute-based functional encryption (MA-ABFE). We view it as an approach to get best of both worlds (fully collusion resistant MA-ABE, and bounded collusion resistant MAFE). By combining our results with prior MA-ABE results, we obtain MA-ABFE for $\\mathsf{NC}^1 \\circ \\mathsf{P}/\\mathsf{Poly}$ from standard pairing-based assumptions, and for $\\mathsf{DNF} \\circ \\mathsf{P}/\\mathsf{Poly}$ from LWE, both in the Random Oracle Model. We also describe a simple construction of MA-ABE for general predicates from witness encryption, and combining with known results, we also get MA-ABFE for $\\mathsf{P}/\\mathsf{Poly} \\circ \\mathsf{P}/\\mathsf{Poly}$ from evasive LWE.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of shared computation architectures assembled from\r\nheterogeneous chiplets introduces new security threats. Due to the shared logical and physical resources, an untrusted chiplet can act maliciously to surreptitiously probe the data communication between chiplets or sense the computation shared between them. This paper presents Garblet, the first framework to leverage the flexibility offered by chiplet technology and Garbled Circuits (GC)-based MPC to enable efficient, secure computation even in the presence of potentially compromised chiplets. Our approach integrates a customized hardware Oblivious Transfer (OT) module and an optimized evaluator engine into chiplet-based platforms. This configuration distributes the tasks of garbling and evaluating circuits across two chiplets, reducing communication costs and enhancing computation speed. We implement this framework on an AMD/Xilinx UltraScale+ multi-chip module and demonstrate its effectiveness using benchmark functions. Additionally, we introduce a novel circuit decomposition technique that allows for parallel processing across multiple chiplets to further improve computational efficiency. Our results highlight the potential of chiplet systems for accelerating GC (e.g., the time complexity of garbled AES is 0.0226ms) in order to guarantee the security and privacy of the computation on chiplets.",

    "abstract": "We study recent algebraic attacks (Briaud-\u00d8ygarden EC'23) on the Regular Syndrome Decoding (RSD) problem and the assumptions underlying the correctness of their attacks' complexity estimates. By relating these assumptions to interesting algebraic-combinatorial problems, we prove that they do not hold in full generality. However, we show that they are (asymptotically) true for most parameter sets, supporting the soundness of algebraic attacks on RSD. Further, we prove\u2014without any heuristics or assumptions\u2014that RSD can be broken in polynomial time whenever the number of error blocks times the square of the size of error blocks is larger than 2 times the square of the dimension of the code.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we use our methodology to attack a variant of the Learning With Errors problem where each error term lies in a fixed set of constant size. We prove that this problem can be broken in polynomial time, given a sufficient number of samples. This result improves on the seminal work by Arora and Ge (ICALP'11), as the attack's time complexity is independent of the LWE modulus.",

The construction achieves $2^{\\Theta(\\log^{1-\\beta} \\lambda)}$ compression factor. As an application, we obtain a private-information retrieval (PIR) with communication complexity $L / 2^{\\Theta(\\log^{1-\\beta} L)}$, for a database of size L.

    "abstract": "The requirement for privacy-aware machine learning increases as we continue to use PII (Personally Identifiable Information) within machine training. To overcome these privacy issues, we can apply Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to encrypt data before it is fed into a machine learning model. This involves creating a homomorphic encryption key pair, and where the associated public key will be used to encrypt the input data, and the private key will decrypt the output. But, there is often a performance hit when we use homomorphic encryption, and so this paper evaluates the performance overhead of using the SVM machine learning technique with the OpenFHE homomorphic encryption library. This uses Python and the scikit-learn library for its implementation.  The experiments include a range of variables such as multiplication depth, scale size, first modulus size, security level, batch size, and ring dimension, along with two different SVM models, SVM-Poly and SVM-Linear. Overall, the results show that the two main parameters which affect performance are the ring dimension and the modulus size, and that SVM-Poly and SVM-Linear show similar performance levels.",

    "abstract": "Cryptographic proofs allow researchers to provide theoretical guarantees on the security that their constructions provide. A proof of security can completely eliminate a class of attacks by potential adversaries. Human fallibility, however, means that even a proof reviewed by experts may still hide flaws or outright errors. Proof assistants are software tools built for the purpose of formally verifying each step in a proof, and as such have the potential to prevent erroneous proofs from being published and insecure constructions from being implemented.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, existing tooling for verifying cryptographic proofs has found limited adoption in the cryptographic community, in part due to concerns with ease of use. We present ProofFrog: a new tool for verifying cryptographic game-hopping proofs. ProofFrog is designed with the average cryptographer in mind, using an imperative syntax similar to C for specifying games and a syntax for proofs that closely models pen-and-paper arguments. As opposed to other proof assistant tools which largely operate by manipulating logical formulae, ProofFrog manipulates abstract syntax trees (ASTs) into a canonical form to establish indistinguishable or equivalent behaviour for pairs of games in a user-provided sequence. We also detail the domain-specific language developed for use with the ProofFrog proof engine, the exact transformations it applies to canonicalize ASTs, and case studies of verified proofs. A tool like ProofFrog that prioritizes ease of use can lower the barrier of entry to using computer-verified proofs and aid in catching insecure constructions before they are made public.",

    "abstract": "We study linear-time prover SNARKs and make the following contributions:\r\n\r\nWe provide a framework for transforming a univariate polynomial commitment scheme into a multilinear polynomial commitment scheme. Our transformation is generic, can be instantiated with any univariate scheme and improves on prior transformations like Gemini (EUROCRYPT 2022) and Virgo (S&P 2020) in all relevant parameters: proof size, verification complexity, and prover complexity. Instantiating the above framework with the KZG univariate polynomial commitment scheme, we get SamaritanPCS \u2013 the first multilinear polynomial commitment scheme with constant proof size and linear-time prover. SamaritanPCS is a drop-in replacement for the popular PST scheme, and improves upon PST in all relevant parameters.\r\n\r\nWe construct LogSpartan \u2013 a new multilinear PIOP for R1CS based on recent techniques for lookup arguments. Compiling this PIOP using SamaritanPCS gives Samaritan \u2013 a SNARK in the universal and updatable SRS setting. Samaritan has linear-time prover, logarithmic verification and logarithmic proof size. Concretely, its proof size is one of the smallest among other known linear-time prover SNARKs without relying on concretely expensive proof recursion techniques. For an R1CS instance with 1 million constraints, Samaritan (over BLS12-381 curve) has a proof size of 6.7KB.\r\n\r\nWe compare Samaritan with other linear-time prover SNARKs in the updatable setting. We asymptotically improve on the $\\log^2 n$ proof size of Spartan. Unlike Libra (CRYPTO 2019), the argument size of Samaritan is independent of the circuit depth. Compared to Gemini (EUROCRYPT 2022), Samaritan achieves 3$\\times$ smaller argument size at 1 million constraints. We match the argument size of HyperPlonk, which is the smallest linear-time SNARK for the Plonkish constraint system, while achieving slightly better verification complexity.\r\n\r\nWe believe that our transformation and our techniques for applying lookups based on logarithmic derivatives to the multilinear setting are of wider interest.",

    "abstract": "Consider a weak analyst that wishes to outsource data collection and computation of aggregate statistics over a a potentially large population of (also weak) clients to a powerful server. For flexibility and efficiency, we consider public-key and non-interactive protocols, meaning the clients know the analyst's public key but do not share secrets, and each client sends at most one message. Furthermore, the final step should be silent, whereby the analyst simply downloads the (encrypted) result from the server when needed. To capture this setting, we define a new primitive  we call Non-Interactive Verifiable Aggregation (NIVA). \r\nWe require both privacy and robustness for a NIVA protocol to be deemed secure. Namely, our security notion for NIVA ensures that the clients' data remains private to both the server and the analyst, while also ensuring that  malicious clients cannot skew the results by providing faulty data.\r\nWe propose a secure NIVA protocol, which we call PEAR (for Private, Efficient, Accurate, Robust), which can validate inputs according to any NP validity rule.  PEAR is based on a novel combination of functional encryption for inner-products (Abdalla et al., PKC 2015) and fully-linear probabilistically-checkable proofs (Boneh et al., Crypto 2019). We emphasize that PEAR is non-interactive, public-key, and  makes black-box use of the underlying cryptographic primitives. Additionally, we devise substantial  optimizations of PEAR for practically-relevant validity rules. Finally, we implement PEAR to show feasibility for such validity rules,  conducting a thorough performance evaluation. In particular, we compare PEAR to two more straightforward or \"off-the-shelf\" NIVA protocols and show performance gains, demonstrating the merit of our new approach. The bottleneck in our protocol comes from the fact that we require the underlying IPFE scheme to be \"unrestricted\" over a large field. As more efficient such schemes are developed, they can be immediately be plugged into PEAR for further gains.",

This obfuscation based attack is then later formalized by Vaikuntanathan, Wee, and Wichs [VWW22].\r\nIn this note, we revisit their attack and show that the attack actually does not work by showing a concrete counterexample.  We then show that their attack can be made valid with some modifications. Along the way, we also improve the counterexample by making it provable. Specifically, our counterexample is valid assuming the (plain) LWE assumption and the existence of instance-hiding witness encryption, whereas their original counterexample was dependent on the heuristic assumption of the existence of an ideal obfuscation.",

    "abstract": "Private computation on common records refers to analyze data from two databases containing shared records without revealing personal information. As a basic requirement for private computation, the databases involved essentially need to be aligned by a common identification system. However, it is hard to expect such common identifiers in real world scenario. For this reason, multiple quasi-identifiers can be used to identify common records. As some quasi-identifiers might be missing or have typos, it is important to support fuzzy records setting. Identifying common records using quasi-identifiers requires manipulation of highly sensitive information, which could be privacy concerns.\r\n\r\nThis work studies the problem of enabling such data analysis on the fuzzy records of quasi-identifiers. To this end, we propose ordered threshold-one (OTO) matching which can be efficiently realized by circuit-based private set intersection (CPSI) protocols and some multiparty computation (MPC) techniques. Furthermore, we introduce some generic encoding techniques from traditional matching rules to the OTO matching. Finally, we achieve a secure efficient private computation protocol which supports various matching rules which have already been widely used.\r\n\r\nWe also demonstrate the superiority of our proposal with experimental validation. First, we empirically check that our encoding to OTO matching does not affect accuracy a lot for the benchmark datasets found in the fuzzy record matching literature. Second, we implement our protocol and achieve significantly faster performance at the cost of communication overhead compared to previous privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) protocols. In the case of 100K records for each dataset, our work shows 147.58MB communication cost, 10.71s setup time, and 1.97s online time, which is 7.78 times faster compared to the previous work (50.12 times faster when considering online time only).",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the concept of a multi-client functional encryption (MC-FE) scheme for attribute-based inner product functions (AB-IP), initially proposed by Abdalla et al. [ASIACRYPT\u201920], in an unbounded setting. In such a setting, the setup is independent of vector length constraints, allowing secret keys to support functions of arbitrary lengths, and clients can dynamically choose vector lengths during encryption. The functionality outputs the sum of inner products if vector lengths and indices meet a specific relation, and all clients\u2019 attributes satisfy the key\u2019s policy. We propose the following constructions based on the matrix decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption in a natural permissive setting\r\nof unboundedness:\r\n\r\n\u2013 the first multi-client attribute-based unbounded IPFE (MC-AB-UIPFE) scheme secure in the standard model, overcoming previous limitations where clients could only encrypt fixed-length data;\r\n\u2013 the first multi-input AB-UIPFE (MI-AB-UIPFE) in the public key setting; improving upon prior bounded constructions under the same assumption;\r\n\u2013 the first dynamic decentralized UIPFE (DD-UIPFE); enhancing the dynamism property of prior works.\r\n\r\nTechnically, we follow the blueprint of Agrawal et al. [CRYPTO\u201923] but begin with a new unbounded FE called extended slotted unbounded IPFE. We first construct a single-input AB-UIPFE in the standard model and then extend it to multi-input settings. In a nutshell, our work demonstrates the applicability of function-hiding security of IPFE in realizing variants of multi-input FE capable of encoding unbounded\r\nlength vectors both at the time of key generation and encryption.",

    "abstract": "Secure Two-Party Computation (2PC) enables secure inference with cryptographic guarantees that protect the privacy of the model owner and client. However, it adds significant performance overhead. In this work, we make 2PC-based secure inference efficient while considering important deployment scenarios.   \r\nWe observe that the hitherto unconsidered latency of fetching keys from storage significantly impacts performance, as does network speed. We design a Linear Secret Sharing (LSS)-based system $LSS^M$ and a Function Secret Sharing (FSS)-based system $FSS^M$ for secure inference, optimized for small key size and communication, respectively. Notably, our highly-optimized and hardware-aware CPU-based $LSS^M$ outperforms prior GPU-based LSS systems by up to $50\\times$. We then show that the best choice between $LSS^M$ and $FSS^M$ depends on the deployment scenario.\r\nIn fact, under certain deployments, a combination of $LSS^M$ and $FSS^M$ can leverage heterogeneous processing across CPU and GPU. Such protocol-system co-design lets us outperform state-of-the-art secure inference systems \r\nby up to $21\\times$ (geomean $3.25\\times$).",

    "abstract": "The Message Layer Security (MLS) protocol has recently been standardized by the IETF. MLS is a scalable secure group messaging protocol expected to run more efficiently compared to the Signal protocol at scale, while offering a similar level of strong security. Even though MLS has undergone extensive examination by researchers, the majority of the works have focused on confidentiality.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we focus on the authenticity of the application messages exchanged in MLS. Currently, MLS authenticates every application message with an EdDSA signature and while manageable, the overhead is greatly amplified in the post-quantum setting as the NIST-recommended Dilithium signature results in a 40x increase in size. We view this as an invitation to explore new authentication modes that can be used instead. We start by taking a systematic view on how application messages are authenticated in MLS and categorize authenticity into four different security notions. We then propose several authentication modes, offering a range of different efficiency and security profiles. For instance, in one of our modes, COSMOS++, we replace signatures with one-time tokens and a MAC tag, offering roughly a 75x savings in the post-quantum communication overhead. While this comes at the cost of weakening security compared to the authentication mode used by MLS, the lower communication overhead seems to make it a worthwhile trade-off with security.",

    "abstract": "We explore advanced security notions for threshold signature schemes, focusing on Beyond UnForgeability Features (BUFF), introduced by Cremers et al. (S&P\u201921)  in the non-threshold setting. The BUFF properties protect against attacks based on maliciously chosen keys, e.g., expropriating a message-signature pair under a new public key (called exclusive ownership). We first formalize these notions in the threshold setting and examine their relationships. Notably, unlike regular signature schemes, the hierarchy of variants of exclusive ownership notions only holds for threshold schemes if they are also robust.\r\nWe then present a generic compiler that transforms any threshold signature scheme to satisfy exclusive ownership, and message-bound signature properties with minimal overhead. Furthermore, we modify the threshold BLS signature scheme to achieve these additional properties without increasing the signature size. Lastly, we identify specific structures in threshold signature schemes where BUFF properties can be naturally extended from the underlying standard signature scheme, and we analyze and prove the security properties in some of the existing threshold schemes.",

In this regard, we demonstrate that the currently best-known cryptanalytic result on $7$-round ChaCha with time $2^{189.7}$ and data $2^{102.63}$ [Xu et al., ToSC 2024] can be estimated as $2^{178.12}$ for time and $2^{101.09}$ for data complexity. We improve the best-known result for the $7.25$ round by obtaining an improved set of Probabilistic Neutral Bits and considering our revised estimation. Our result with time complexity $2^{212.43}$ and data complexity $2^{100.56}$ improves the result of Xu et al., where they could achieve time and data complexity $2^{223.9}$ and $2^{100.80}$, respectively. For both the $7$ and $7.25$ rounds, we can show an improvement of the order of $2^{11}$ in the time complexity. For $7.5$-round, we improve the result of Dey [IEEE-IT 2024], which reports the time and data complexity of $2^{255.24}$ and $2^{32.64}$, respectively. By applying the formula of the same paper and incorporating additional PNBs, we obtain improved time and data complexity of $2^{253.23}$ and $2^{34.47}$, respectively. Thus, this paper describes the currently best-known cryptanalytic results against reduced round ChaCha. Our results do not affect the security claims of the complete algorithm with 20 rounds. Also, we provide a rebuttal of the Work by Wang et al. \\cite{wangeprint} and analyze their claim about the error in the ``Divide-and-Conquer'' Approach.",

    "abstract": "Bootstrapping in approximate homomorphic encryption involves evaluating the modular reduction function. Traditional methods decompose the modular reduction function into three components: scaled cosine, double-angle formula, and inverse sine. While these approaches offer a strong trade-off between computational cost and level consumption, they lack flexibility in parameterization. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose a new method to decompose the modular reduction function with improved parameterization, generalizing prior trigonometric approaches. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method achieves near-optimal approximation errors. Additionally, we introduce a technique that integrates the rescaling operation into matrix operations during bootstrapping, further reducing computational overhead.",

    "abstract": "Anonymous tokens with private metadata bit (ATPM) have received increased interest as a method for anonymous client authentication while also embedding trust signals that are only readable by the authority who holds the issuance secret key and nobody else. A drawback of all existing ATPM constructions is that they require client-issuer interaction during the issuance process. In this work, we build the first non-interactive anonymous tokens (NIAT) with private metadata bit, inspired by the recent work of Hanzlik (Eurocrypt '23) on non-interactive blind signatures.  We discuss how the non-interaction property during the issuance process allows for more efficient issuance protocols that avoid the need for online signing. We construct an efficient NIAT scheme based   on Structure-preserving Signatures on Equivalence Classes (SPS-EQ) and experimentally evaluate its performance. We also present an extension to our NIAT construction that allows the identification of clients who attempt to double-spend (i.e., present the same token twice).",

    "abstract": "Non-malleable zero-knowledge (NMZK), originally  introduced in the seminal work of Dolev, Dwork, and Naor (STOC 91), is a fundamental concept for modeling the security of proof systems against man-in-the-middle attacks. \r\n\r\nRecently, Kim, Liang, and Pandey (CRYPTO 2022) presented the first efficient constant-round NMZK argument system based solely on symmetric-key cryptography. Their construction relies on a non-black-box use of the involved cryptographic primitives and on multiple executions of Ligero (CCS 2017) that affect both the round complexity and the computational efficiency of their protocol. Their work left open the natural important challenge of achieving NMZK using the underlying primitives only in a black-box fashion (regardless of the number of rounds and  actual efficiency).\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we solve the aforementioned open problem by presenting the first NMZK argument system based on the black-box use of cryptographic primitives. Our work is optimal in the use of primitives since we only need one-way functions, and asymptotically optimal in the number of rounds since we only require a constant number of rounds. Our argument system is non-malleable with respect to the strong \"simulation-extractability\" flavor of non-malleability. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, we also show that our construction can be efficiently instantiated in Minicrypt, significantly improving upon the work of Kim et al., both in terms of round complexity and  computational efficiency.",

Somehow, in this race of make and break, the stress on\r\nautomation of adopting such techniques on real-life circuits has\r\nbeen rather limited. For the first time, we present a generic\r\nend-to-end combinational logic locking CAD framework, MIDAS.\r\nThis framework analyses circuit netlists and generates locked\r\nnetlists. Due to its generic circuit analysis, it bridges the gap,\r\nintegrates diverse logic locking techniques, and offers a scope of\r\nintegration of potential future ones.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new type of non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK), called Fine-grained Verifier NIZK (FV-NIZK), which provides more flexible and more fine-grained verifiability of proofs than standard NIZK that supports public verifiability and  designated-verifier NIZK (DV-NIZK) that supports private verifiability. FV-NIZK has two statistically (or computationally) equivalent verification approaches: \r\n\r\n--- a master verification using the master secret key $msk$; \r\n\r\n--- a fine-grained verification using a derived secret key $sk_d$, which is derived from $msk$ w.r.t. $d$ (which may stand for user identity, email address, vector, etc.). \r\n\r\nWe require unbounded simulation soundness (USS) of FV-NIZK to hold, even if an adversary obtains derived secret keys $sk_d$ with $d$ of its choices, and  define proof pseudorandomness which stipulates the pseudorandomness of proofs for adversaries that are not given any secret key. \r\n\r\nWe present two instantiations of FV-NIZK for linear subspace languages, based on the matrix decisional Diffie-Hellman (MDDH) assumption. \r\nOne of the FV-NIZK instantiations is pairing-free and achieves almost tight USS and proof pseudorandomness. We also adapt the two instantiations to support unbounded fine-grained secret key delegations.\r\n\r\nWe illustrate the usefulness of FV-NIZK by showing two applications and obtain the following pairing-free schemes:\r\n\r\n--- the first almost tightly multi-challenge CCA (mCCA)-secure inner-product functional encryption (IPFE) scheme without pairings;\r\n\r\n--- the first public-key encryption (PKE) scheme that reconciles the inherent contradictions between public verifiability and anonymity. \r\nWe formalize such PKE as Fine-grained Verifiable PKE (FV-PKE), which derives a special key from the decryption secret key, such that for those who obtain the derived key, they can check the validity of ciphertexts but the anonymity is lost from their views (CCA-security still holds for them), while for others who do not get the derived key, they cannot do the validity check but the anonymity holds for them. \r\n\r\nOur FV-PKE scheme achieves almost tight mCCA-security for adversaries who obtain the derived keys, and achieves almost tight ciphertext pseudorandomness (thus anonymity) for others who do not get any derived key.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new one-more computational problem for lattice-based cryptography, which we refer to as the Algebraic One-More MISIS problem, or AOM-MISIS for short. It is a modification of the AOM-MLWE problem recently introduced by Espitau et al. (CRYPTO \u201924) to prove security of new two-round threshold signatures.\r\n\r\nOur first main result establishes that the hardness of AOM-MISIS is implied by the hardness of MSIS and MLWE (with suitable parameters), both of which are standard assumptions for efficient lattice-based cryptography. We prove this result via a new generalization of a technique by Tessaro and Zhu (EUROCRYPT \u201923) used to prove hardness of a one-more problem for linear hash functions assuming their collision resistance, for which no clear lattice analogue was known. Since the hardness of AOM-MISIS implies the hardness of AOM-MLWE, our result resolves the main open question from the work of Espitau et al., who only provided a similar result for AOM-MLWE restricted to selective adversaries, a class which does not cover the use for threshold signatures.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we show that our novel formulation of AOM-MISIS offers a better interface to develop tighter security bounds for state-of-the-art two-round threshold signatures. We exemplify this by providing new proofs of security, assuming the hardness of MLWE and MSIS, for two threshold signatures, the one proposed in the same work by Espitau et al., as well as a recent construction by Chairattana-Apirom et al. (ASIACRYPT 2024). For the former scheme, we also show that it satisfies the strongest security notion (TS-UF-4) in the security hierarchy of Bellare et al. (CRYPTO \u201922), as a result of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "ChaCha is a widely deployed stream cipher and one of the most important symmetric primitives. Due to this practical importance, many cryptanalysis have been proposed. Until now, Probabilistic Neutral Bits (PNBs) have been the most successful. Given differential-linear distinguishers, PNBs are the technique for key recovery relying on an experimental backward correlation obtained through blackbox analysis. A careful theoretical analysis exploiting the round function design may find a better attack and improve our understanding, but the complicated nature of the ARX structure makes such analysis difficult.  \r\n%\r\nWe propose a theoretical methodology inspired by bit puncturing, which was recently proposed at Eurocrypt 2024. Our method has a theoretical foundation and is thus fundamentally different from PNBs, to which it is the first effective alternative. As a result, we significantly improved the attack complexity for 6, 7, and 7.5-round ChaCha. The 7-round attack is about $2^{40}$ times faster than the previous best. Furthermore, we propose the first 7.5-round attack with a non-negligible advantage over an exhaustive search.",

    "abstract": "Presenting a novel use of encryption, not for hiding a secret, but for marking letters.  Given a 2n letters plaintext, the transmitter encrypts the first n letters with  key K1 to generate corresponding n cipherletters, and encrypts the second n letters with key K2 to generate n corresponding cipherletters. The transmitter sends the 2n cipherletters along with the keys, K1 and K2  The recipient (and any interceptor) will readily decrypt the 2n cipherletters to the original plaintext.  This makes the above procedure equivalent to sending out the plaintext.  So why bother?  When decrypting the 2n cipherletters one will make a note of how the letters that were encrypted with K1 are mixed with the letters encrypted with K2 while keeping the original order of the letters encrypted with each key. There are 2^n possible mixings. Which means that the choice of mixing order can deliver a secret message, S,  comprising n bits. So while on the surface a given plaintext is sent out from transmitter to recipient, this plaintext hides a secret.  Imagine a text messaging platform that uses this protocol. An adversary will not know which plain innocent message harbors a secret message.  This allows residents of cyberspace to communicate secrets without exposing the fact that they communicated a secret. Expect a big impact on the level of cyberspace privacy.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study preimage resistance of the SHA-3 standard. We propose a squeeze meet-in-the-middle attack as a new preimage attack method for the sponge functions. This attack combines the squeeze attack and meet-in-the-middle attack, and is implemented by internal differentials. We analyze the inverse operation of the SHA-3 round function, and develop a new target internal differential algorithm as well as a linearization technique for the Sbox in the backward phase. In addition, we propose the concept of a value-difference distribution table (VDDT) to optimize the attack complexity. These techniques lead to faster preimage attacks on five (out of six) SHA-3 functions reduced to 4 rounds, and also bring preimage attacks on 5 rounds of four SHA-3 instances. The attack techniques are verified by performing practical preimage attack on a small variant of 4-round Keccak.",

Our focus is on distinguishing problems related to the security of NIST round-4  McEliece-like cryptosystems, particularly for Goppa codes used in ClassicMcEliece and Quasi-Cyclic Moderate Density Parity-Check (QC-MDPC) codes used in BIKE. We present DeepDistinguisher, a new algorithm for distinguishing structured codes from random linear codes that uses a transformer. The results show that the new distinguisher achieves a high level of accuracy in distinguishing Goppa codes, suggesting that their structure may be more recognizable by AI models. Our approach outperforms traditional attacks in distinguishing Goppa codes in certain settings and does generalize to larger code lengths without further training using a puncturing technique. We also present the first distinguishing results dedicated to MDPC and QC-MDPC codes.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in cryptography is the construction of succinct garbling schemes that have asymptotically smaller size than Yao\u2019s garbled circuit construction. We present a new framework for succinct garbling that replaces the heavy machinery of most previous constructions by lighter-weight homomorphic secret sharing techniques.\r\n\r\nConcretely, we achieve 1-bit-per-gate (amortized) garbling size for Boolean circuits under circular variants of standard assumptions in composite-order or prime-order groups, as well as a lattice-based instantiation. We further extend these ideas to layered circuits, improving the per-gate cost below 1 bit, and to arithmetic circuits, eliminating the typical \u03a9(\u03bb)-factor overhead for garbling mod-p computations. Our constructions also feature \u201cleveled\u201d variants that remove circular-security requirements at the cost of adding a depth-dependent term to the garbling size.\r\n\r\nOur framework significantly extends a recent technique of Liu, Wang, Yang, and Yu (Eurocrypt 2025) for lattice-based succinct garbling, and opens new avenues toward practical succinct garbling. For moderately large circuits with a few million gates, our garbled circuits can be two orders of magnitude smaller than Yao-style garbling. While our garbling and evaluation algorithms are much slower, they are still practically feasible, unlike previous fully succinct garbling schemes that rely on expensive tools such as iO or a non-black-box combination of FHE and ABE. This trade-off\r\ncan make our framework appealing when a garbled circuit is used as a functional ciphertext that is broadcast or stored in multiple locations (e.g., on a blockchain), in which case communication and storage may dominate computational cost.",

    "abstract": "Practical signature-based witness encryption (SWE) schemes recently emerged as a viable alternative to instantiate timed-release cryptography in the honest majority setting. In particular, assuming threshold trust in a set of parties that release signatures at a specified time, one can ``encrypt to the future'' using an SWE scheme. Applications of SWE schemes include voting, auctions, distributed randomness beacons, and more. However, the lack of homomorphism in existing SWE schemes reduces efficiency and hinders deployment. In this work, we introduce the notion of homomorphic SWE (HSWE) to improve the practicality of timed-release encryption schemes. We show one can build HSWE using a pair of encryption and signature schemes where the uniqueness of the signature is required when the encryption scheme relies on injective one-way functions. We then build three HSWE schemes in various settings using BLS, RSA, and Rabin signatures and show how to achieve a privacy-preserving variant that only allows extracting the homomorphically aggregated result while keeping the individual plaintexts confidential",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art protocols that achieve constant-round secure multiparty computation currently present a trade-off: either consume an amount of communication that scales quadratically in the number of parties, or achieve better asymptotics at the cost of high constant factors (e.g. schemes based on LPN or DDH).\r\n \r\nWe construct a constant-round MPC protocol where communication scales linearly in the number of parties n. Our construction relies only on OT and RO, and it leverages packed secret sharing. Due to building on simple primitives, our protocol offers concrete improvement over asymptotically-efficient LPN-based schemes.  We consider security in the presence of a dishonest majority where the malicious (with abort) adversary corrupts an arbitrary constant fraction of parties. \r\n\r\nBy leveraging tri-state circuits (Heath et al. Crypto 2023), we extend our protocol to the RAM model of computation. For a RAM program that halts within $T$ steps, our maliciously-secure protocol communicates $O(n \\cdot T  \\log^3 T  \\log \\log T \\cdot \\kappa)$ total bits, where $\\kappa$ is a security parameter.",

    "abstract": "P  vs  NP  problem  is  the   most  important  unresolved  problem  in  the  field  of computational complexity. Its impact has penetrated into all aspects of algorithm design,  especially  in  the  field  of  cryptography.  The  security  of  cryptographic algorithms  based  on  short  keys  depends  on  whether  P  is  equal  to  NP.  In  fact, Shannon  strictly  proved  that  the  one-time-pad  system  meets  unconditional security, but because the one-time-pad system requires the length of key to be at least the length of plaintext, how to transfer the key is a troublesome problem that restricts the use of the one-time-pad system in practice. Cryptography algorithms used  in  practice  are  all  based  on  short  key,  and  the  security  of  the  short  key mechanism is ultimately based on one-way assumption. In fact, the existence of one-way function can directly lead to the important conclusion P\u2260NP.\r\nIn this paper, we originally constructed a short-key block cipher algorithm. The core feature of this algorithm is that for any block, when a plaintext-ciphertext pair is known, any key in the key space is valid, that is, for each block, the plaintext-ciphertext pair and the key are independence, and the independence between blocks is also easy to construct. This feature is completely different from all existing short-key cipher algorithms.\r\nBased on the above feature, we construct a problem and theoretically prove that the  problem  satisfies  the  properties  of  one-way  functions,  thereby  solving  the problem of the existence of one-way functions, that is, directly proving that P\u2260NP.",

    "abstract": "In verifiable secret sharing (VSS), a dealer shares a secret input among several parties, ensuring each share is verifiable. Motivated by its applications in the blockchain space, we focus on a VSS where parties holding shares are not allowed to reconstruct the dealer's secret (even partially) on their own terms, which we address as privacy-targeted collusion if attempted. \r\n\r\n    In this context, our work investigates mechanisms deterring such collusion in VSS among rational and malicious parties. For this problem, we make both algorithmic and combinatorial contributions:\r\n    1. We provide two collusion-deterrent mechanisms to discourage parties from colluding and recovering the dealer's secret. Notably, when it is desired to achieve fairness---where non-colluding parties are not at a loss---while allowing for the best achievable malicious fault tolerance, we define ``trackable access structures'' (TAS) and design a deterrence mechanism tailored for VSS on these structures. \r\n    2. We estimate the size of the optimal TAS, construct them from Steiner systems, provide highly robust TAS using partial Steiner systems, and present efficient secret sharing schemes for the latter close-to-optimal TAS for various parameter regimes.\r\n    3. We demonstrate that trackability in access structures is connected to combinatorial objects like (partial) Steiner systems, uniform subsets with restricted intersections, and appropriate binary codes. The robustness of access structures is equivalent to the minimum vertex cover of hypergraphs. \r\n\r\n    We believe these connections between cryptography, game theory, and discrete mathematics will be of broader interest.",

    "abstract": "We consider the question of protecting a general computation device, modeled by a stateful Boolean circuit, against leakage of partial information about its internal wires. Goyal et al. (FOCS 2016) obtained a solution for the case of bounded-communication leakage, where the wires are partitioned into two parts and the leakage can be any function computed using $t$ bits of communication between the parts. However, this solution suffers from two major limitations: (1) it only applies to a one-shot (stateless) computation, mapping an encoded input to an encoded output, and (2) the leakage-resilient circuit consumes fresh random bits, whose number scales linearly with the circuit complexity of the computed function.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we eliminate the first limitation and make progress on the second. Concretely:\r\n- We present the first construction of stateful circuits that offer information-theoretic protection against continuous bounded-communication leakage. As an application, we extend a two-party ``malware-resilient'' protocol of Goyal et al. to the continuous-leakage case. \r\n- For simple types of bounded-communication leakage, which leak $t$ parities or $t$ disjunctions of circuit wires or their negations, we obtain a deterministic variant that does not require any fresh randomness beyond the randomness in the initial state. Here we get computational security based on a subexponentially secure one-way function. This is the first deterministic leakage-resilient circuit construction for any nontrivial class of global leakage.",

    "abstract": "Matrix multiplication of two encrypted matrices (CC-MM) is a key challenge for privacy-preserving machine learning applications. As modern machine learning models focus on scalability, fast CC-MM on large datasets is increasingly in demand.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we present a CC-MM algorithm for large matrices. The algorithm consists of plaintext matrix multiplications (PP-MM) and ciphertext matrix transpose algorithms (C-MT). We propose a fast C-MT algorithm, which is computationally inexpensive compared to PP-MM. By leveraging high-performance BLAS libraries to optimize PP-MM, we implement large-scale CC-MM with substantial performance improvements. Furthermore, we propose lightweight algorithms, significantly reducing the key size from $1\\ 960$ MB to $1.57$ MB for CC-MM with comparable efficiency.\r\n\r\nIn a single-thread implementation, the C-MT algorithm takes $0.76$ seconds to transpose a $2\\ 048\\times 2\\ 048$ encrypted matrix. The CC-MM algorithm requires $85.2$ seconds to multiply two $4\\ 096\\times 4\\ 096$ encrypted matrices. For large matrices, our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art CC-MM method from Jiang-Kim-Lauter-Song [CCS'18] by a factor of over $800$.",

    "abstract": "Oblivious permutation (OP) enables two parties, a sender with a private data vector $x$ and a receiver with a private permutation \u03c0, to securely obtain the shares of \u03c0(x). OP has been used to construct many important MPC primitives and applications such as secret shuffle, oblivious sorting, private set operations, secure database analysis, and privacy-preserving machine learning. Due to its high complexity, OP has become a performance bottleneck in several practical applications, and many efforts have been devoted to enhancing its concrete efficiency. Chase et al. (Asiacrypt'20) proposed an offline-online OP paradigm leveraging a pre-computable resource termed Share Translation. While this paradigm significantly reduces online costs, the substantial offline cost of generating Share Translation remains an area for further investigation.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we redefine the pre-computable resource as a cryptographic primitive known as Correlated Oblivious Permutation (COP) and conduct in-depth analyses and optimizations of the two COP generation solutions: network-based solution and matrix-based solution. The optimizations for the network-based solution halve the communication/computation cost of constructing a switch (the basic unit of the permutation network) and reduce the number of switches in the permutation network. The optimizations for the matrix-based solution halve the communication cost of small-size COP generation and reduce the cost of large-size COP generation with in-outside permutation decomposition.\r\n\r\nWe implement our two COP generation protocols and conduct comprehensive evaluations. Taking commonly used 128-bit input data as an example, our network-based and matrix-based solutions are up to 1.7x and 1.6x faster than baseline protocols, respectively. \r\n We further facilitate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) PSU protocols with our optimized COP, achieving over 25% reduction in communication cost and 35% decrease in execution time. This shows that our COP optimizations bring significant improvements for real-world MPC primitives.",

    "abstract": "Cryptographic schemes often contain verification steps that are essential for security. Yet, faulty implementations missing these steps can easily go unnoticed, as the schemes might still function correctly. A prominent instance of such a verification step is the re-encryption check in the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform that plays a prominent role in the post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) considered in NIST's PQC standardization process. In KEMs built from FO, decapsulation performs a re-encryption check that is essential for security, but not for functionality. In other words, it will go unnoticed if this essential step is omitted or wrongly implemented, opening the door for key recovery attacks. Notably, such an implementation flaw was present in HQC's reference implementation and was only noticed after 19 months.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we develop a modified FO transform that binds re-encryption to functionality, ensuring that a faulty implementation which skips re-encryption will be exposed through basic correctness tests. We do so by adapting the \"verifiable verification\" methodology of Fischlin and G\u00fcnther (CCS 2023) to the context of FO-based KEMs. More concretely, by exporting an unpredictable confirmation code from the public key encryption and embedding it into the key derivation function, we can confirm that (most of) the re-encryption step was indeed performed during decapsulation. We formalize this concept, establish modified FO transforms, and prove how unpredictable PKE confirmation codes turn into noticeable correctness errors for faulty implementations. We show how to apply this technique to ML-KEM and HQC, both with negligible overhead, by leveraging the entropy lost through ciphertext compression or truncation. We confirm that our approach works through mathematical proofs, as well as experimental data. Our experiments show that the implementation flaw in HQC's reference implementation indeed makes basic test cases when following our approach.",

    "abstract": "We describe, formally model, and prove the security of Telegram's key exchange protocols for client-server communications. To achieve this, we develop a suitable multi-stage key exchange security model along with pseudocode descriptions of the Telegram protocols that are based on analysis of Telegram's specifications and client source code. We carefully document how our descriptions differ from reality and justify our modelling choices. Our security proofs reduce the security of the protocols to that of their cryptographic building blocks, but the subsequent analysis of those building blocks requires the introduction of a number of novel security assumptions, reflecting many design decisions made by Telegram that are suboptimal from the perspective of formal analysis. Along the way, we provide a proof of  IND-CCA security for the variant of RSA-OEAP+ used in Telegram and identify a hypothetical attack exploiting current Telegram server behaviour (which is not captured in our protocol descriptions). Finally, we reflect on the broader lessons about protocol design that can be taken from our work.",

    "abstract": "Presenting a protocol that builds a cryptographic solution which shifts security responsibility from the cipher designer to the cipher user.  The Polar Lattice is a pattern-devoid cryptographic cipher. It is based on a geometric construct -- a polar lattice, on which the letters of a plaintext alphabet A, are presented as two points each letter, so that to transmit a letter the transmitter transmits a randomized pathway, a trail, (ciphertext) that begins at the first point of the transmitted letter and ends at the second point of the transmitted letter; the transmitted pathway is a set of steps on the lattice. Once a letter is transmitted the next bits on the ciphertext mark the beginning of the pathway that points to the next letter. The size and the geometric construction of the polar lattice are randomized and kept secret. The randomized pathways may be long or short, the attacker does not know how to parcel the ciphertext to individual trails pointing to distinct letters in the plaintext alphabet A. The polar lattice may be implemented algebraically, or geometrically; the lattice may be a physical nano-construct. The polar lattice is very power efficient, very fast. It claims all the attributes associated with pattern devoid cryptography: it allows for only brute force cryptanalysis, which in turn can be defeated through increased ciphertext size, unlimited key size and structure complexity.",

    "abstract": "Privacy-preserving distributed computation enables a resource-limited client to securely delegate computations on sensitive data to multiple servers by distributing shares of the data.  In such systems, verifiable secret sharing (VSS) is a fundamental component, ensuring secure data distribution and directly impacting the overall performance. The most practical approach to construct VSS is through polynomial commitment (PC), with two main research directions to improve the VSS efficiency. The first focuses on improving the dealer time by designing PC that supports batch evaluation, i.e., generating multiple evaluation$\\&$proof pairs in one shot. The second  aims to reduce the broadcast cost by designing PC that supports batch opening, i.e., producing a compact proof for multiple evaluations. \r\n\r\nRecently, Zhang et al. (Usenix Security 2022) proposed a transparent PC that supports batch evaluation and obtained a transparent VSS with optimal dealer time. However, their scheme does not support batch opening, leading to high broadcast costs in VSS. To the best of our knowledge, no transparent PC currently supports both batch evaluation and batch opening, thus limiting the performance of existing VSS schemes.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose a transparent fully batchable polynomial commitment (TFB-PC), that simultaneously supports batch evaluation  and batch opening. Leveraging TFB-PC, we present a VSS scheme with optimal complexity: $O(n\\log n)$ dealer time, $O(n)$ participant time and $O(n)$ communication cost. Furthermore, we implement our VSS scheme and compare its performance with Zhang et al.\u2019s VSS\r\n(the naive approach). Results show that our scheme achieves $954\\text{-}27,595\\times$ reduction in communication cost and a $1,028\\text{-}1,155,106\\times$ speed up in participant time for $2^{11}$-$2^{21}$ parties.",

    "abstract": "Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is one of the most widely used and extensively studied encryption algorithms globally, which is renowned for its efficiency and robust resistance to attacks. In this paper, three quantum circuits are designed to implement the S-box, which is the sole nonlinear component in AES. By incorporating a linear key schedule, we achieve a quantum circuit for implementing AES with the minimum number of qubits used. As a consequence, only 264/328/398 qubits are needed to implement the quantum circuits for AES-128/192/256. Furthermore, through quantum circuits of the S-box and key schedule, the overall size of the quantum circuit required for Grover's algorithm to attack AES is significantly decreased. This enhancement improves both the security and resource efficiency of AES in a quantum computing environment.",

    "abstract": "Fault attacks pose a significant threat to cryptographic implementations, motivating the development of countermeasures, primarily based on a combination of redundancy and masking techniques. Redundancy, in these countermeasures, is often implemented via duplication or linear codes. However, their inherent structure remains susceptible to strategic fault injections bypassing error checks. To address this, the CAPA countermeasure from CRYPTO 2018 leveraged information-theoretic MAC tags for protection against fault and combined attacks. However, a recent attack has shown that CAPA can only protect against either side-channel analysis or fault attacks, but not both simultaneously, and with significant hardware costs. Its successor, M&M, improves efficiency but lacks protection against ineffective faults.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose StaMAC, a framework aimed at securely incorporating MAC tags against both side-channel and fault adversaries in a non-combined scenario. We extend the security notions outlined in StaTI from TCHES 2024, and propose the notion of MAC-stability, ensuring fault propagation in masked and MACed circuits, necessitating only a single error check at the end of the computation. Additionally, we show that the stability notion from StaTI is arbitrarily composable (whereas it was previously thought to be only serially composable), making it the first arbitrary composable fault security notion which does not require intermediate error checks or correction. Then, we establish the improved protection of masking combined with MAC tags compared to linear encoding techniques by showing bounds on the advantage considering several fault adversaries: a gate/register faulting adversary, an arbitrary register faulting adversary, and a random register faulting adversary. Then, we show how to transform any probing secure circuit to protect against fault attacks using the proposed MAC-stable gadgets implementing field operations. Finally, we demonstrate StaMAC on an AES implementation, evaluating its security and hardware costs compared to the countermeasures using MAC tags.",

The subpermutations are generated by a 5-cell cellular automaton based on a unique well-chosen rule and bijective affine transformations. In particular, the cellular automaton rule is chosen based on empirical tests of its ability to generate good pseudorandom output on a ring cellular automaton. Similarly, Feistel's network layout is based on empirical data regarding the quality of the output S-box.\r\n\r\nWe perform cryptanalysis of the generated 10-bit S-box: we test the properties of algebraic degree, algebraic complexity, nonlinearity, strict avalanche criterion, bit independence criterion, linear approximation probability, differential approximation probability, differential uniformity and boomerang uniformity of our S-box, and relate them to those of the AES S-box. We find security properties comparable to or sometimes even better than those of the standard AES S-box. We believe that our S-box could be used to replace the 5-bit substitution of ciphers like ASCON.",

    "abstract": "In this work we revisit the post-quantum security of KEM-based password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE), specifically that of (O)CAKE. So far, these schemes evaded a security proof considering quantum adversaries. We give a detailed analysis of why this is the case, determining the missing proof techniques. To this end, we first provide a proof of security in the post-quantum setting, up to a single gap. This proof already turns out to be technically involved, requiring advanced techniques to reason in the QROM, including the compressed oracle and the extractable QROM. To pave the way towards closing the gap, we then further identify an efficient simulator for the ideal cipher. This provides certain programming abilities as a necessary and sufficient condition to close the gap in the proof: we demonstrate that we can close the gap using the simulator, and give a meta-reduction based on KEM-anonymity that shows the impossibility of a non-programming reduction that covers a class of KEMs that includes Kyber / ML-KEM.",

    "abstract": "Generative models have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of applications. Training such models using proprietary data from multiple parties has been studied in the realm of federated learning. Yet recent studies showed that reconstruction of authentic training data can be achieved in such settings. \r\nOn the other hand, multiparty computation (MPC) guarantees standard data privacy, yet scales poorly for training generative models. \r\nIn this paper, we focus on improving reconstruction hardness during Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) training while keeping the training cost tractable. To this end, we explore two training protocols that use a public generator and an MPC discriminator: Protocol 1 (P1) uses a fully private discriminator, while Protocol 2 (P2) privatizes the first three discriminator layers. We prove reconstruction hardness for P1 and P2 by showing that (1) a public generator does not allow recovery of authentic training data, as long as the first two layers of the discriminator are private; and through an existing approximation hardness result on ReLU networks, (2) a discriminator with at least three private layers does not allow authentic data reconstruction with algorithms polynomial in network depth and size. We show empirically that compared with fully MPC training, P1 reduces the training time by $2\\times$ and P2 further by $4-16\\times$.",

    "abstract": "Shuffles are used in electronic voting in much the same way physical ballot boxes are used in paper systems: (encrypted) ballots are input into the shuffle and (encrypted) ballots are output in a random order, thereby breaking the link between voter identities and ballots. To guarantee that no ballots are added, omitted or altered, zero-knowledge proofs, called proofs of shuffle, are used to provide publicly verifiable transcripts that prove that the outputs are a re-encrypted permutation of the inputs. The most prominent proofs of shuffle, in practice, are those due to Terelius and\r\nWikstro\u0308m (TW), and Bayer and Groth (BG). TW is simpler whereas BG is more efficient, both in terms of bandwidth and computation. Security for the simpler (TW) proof of shuffle has already been machine-checked but several prominent vendors insist on using the more complicated BG proof of shuffle. Here, we machine-check the security of the Bayer-Groth proof of shuffle via the Coq proof-assistant. We then extract the verifier (software) required to check the transcripts produced by Bayer-Groth implementations and use it to check transcripts from the Swiss Post evoting\r\nsystem under development for national elections in Switzerland.",

    "abstract": "The key collision attack was proposed as an open problem in key-committing security in Authenticated Encryption (AE) schemes like $\\texttt{AES-GCM}$ and $\\texttt{ChaCha20Poly1305}$. In ASIACRYPT 2024, Taiyama et al. introduce a novel type of key collision\u2014target-plaintext key collision ($\\texttt{TPKC}$) for $\\texttt{AES}$. Depending on whether the plaintext is fixed, $\\texttt{TPKC}$ can be divided into $\\texttt{fixed-TPKC}$ and $\\texttt{free-TPKC}$, which can be directly converted into collision attacks and semi-free-start collision attacks on the Davies-Meyer ($\\texttt{DM}$) hashing mode. \r\n  In this paper, we propose a new rebound attack framework leveraging a time-memory tradeoff strategy, enabling practical key collision attacks with optimized complexity. We also present an improved automatic method for finding \\textit{rebound-friendly} differential characteristics by controlling the probabilities in the inbound and outbound phases, allowing the identified characteristics to be directly used in $\\textit{rebound-based}$ key collision attacks. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that the 2-round $\\texttt{AES-128}$ $\\texttt{fixed-TPKC}$ attack proposed by Taiyama et al. is a $\\texttt{free-TPKC}$ attack in fact, while $\\texttt{fixed-TPKC}$ attacks are considerably more challenging than $\\texttt{free-TPKC}$ attacks. By integrating our improved automatic method with a new rebound attack framework, we successfully identify a new differential characteristic for the 2-round $\\texttt{AES-128}$ $\\texttt{fixed-TPKC}$ attack and develope the first practical $\\texttt{fixed-TPKC}$ attack against 2-round $\\texttt{AES-128}$. Additionally, we present practical $\\texttt{fixed-TPKC}$ attacks against 5-round $\\texttt{AES-192}$ and 3-round $\\texttt{Kiasu-BC}$, along with a practical $\\texttt{free-TPKC}$ attack against 6-round $\\texttt{Kiasu-BC}$. Furthermore, we reduce time complexities for $\\texttt{free-TPKC}$ and $\\texttt{fixed-TPKC}$ attacks on other $\\texttt{AES}$ variants.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the deployment of Multi-Party Computation (MPC) in corporate data processing environments, focusing on its legal and technical implications under the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). By combining expertise in cryptography and legal analysis, we address critical questions necessary for assessing the suitability of MPC for real-world applications. Our legal evaluation explores the conditions under which MPC qualifies as an anonymizing approach under GDPR, emphasizing the architectural requirements, such as the distribution of control among compute parties, to minimize re-identification risks effectively. The assertions put forth in the legal opinion are validated by two distinct assessments conducted independently.\r\n\r\nWe systematically answer key regulatory questions, demonstrating that a structured legal assessment is indispensable for organizations aiming to adopt MPC while ensuring compliance with privacy laws. In addition, we complement this analysis with a practical implementation of privacy-preserving analytics using Carbyne Stack, a cloud-native open-source platform for scalable MPC applications, which integrates the MP-SPDZ framework as its backend. We benchmark SQL queries under various security models to evaluate scalability and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Poly1305 is a widely-deployed polynomial hash function. The rationale behind its design was laid out in a series of papers by Bernstein, the last of which dates back to 2005. As computer architectures evolved, some of its design features became less relevant, but implementers found new ways of exploiting these features to boost its performance. However, would we still converge to this same design if we started afresh with today's computer architectures and applications? To answer this question, we gather and systematize a body of knowledge concerning polynomial hash design and implementation that is spread across research papers, cryptographic libraries, and developers' blogs. We develop a framework to automate the validation and benchmarking of the ideas that we collect. This approach leads us to five new candidate designs for polynomial hash functions. Using our framework, we generate and evaluate different implementations and optimization strategies for each candidate. We obtain substantial improvements over Poly1305 in terms of security and performance. Besides laying out the rationale behind our new designs, our paper serves as a reference for efficiently implementing polynomial hash functions, including Poly1305.",

    "abstract": "In the interconnected global financial system, anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) regulations are indispensable for safeguarding financial integrity. However, while illicit transactions constitute only a small fraction of overall financial activities, traditional AML/CFT frameworks impose uniform compliance burdens on all users, resulting in inefficiencies, transaction delays, and privacy concerns. \r\nThese issues stem from the institution-centric model, where financial entities independently conduct compliance checks, resulting in repeated exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) and operational bottlenecks.\r\nTo address these challenges, we introduce \\textsf{zkAML}, a cryptographic framework that offers a novel approach to AML/CFT compliance. By leveraging zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) proofs, \\textsf{zkAML}~enables users to cryptographically demonstrate their regulatory compliance without revealing sensitive personal information. This approach eliminates redundant identity checks, streamlines compliance procedures, and enhances transaction efficiency while preserving user privacy.\r\nWe implement and evaluate \\textsf{zkAML}~on a blockchain network to demonstrate its practicality. Our experimental results show that \\textsf{zkAML}~achieves 55 transactions per second (TPS) on a public network and 324 TPS on a private network. The zk-SNARK proof generation times are $226.59$ms for senders and $215.76$ms for receivers, with a constant verification time of $1.47$ms per transaction. These findings highlight \\textsf{zkAML}'s potential as a privacy-preserving and regulation-compliant solution for modern financial systems.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the algebraic cryptanalysis of small-scale variants of the E0 stream cipher, a legacy cipher used in the Bluetooth protocol. By systematically reducing the size of the linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) while preserving the cipher\u2019s core structure, we investigate the relationship between the number of unknowns and the number of consecutive keystream bits required to recover the internal states of the LFSRs. Our work demonstrates an approximately linear relationship between the number of consecutive keystream bits and the size of small-scale E0 variants, as indicated by our experimental results. To this end, we utilize two approaches: the computation of Gr\u00f6bner bases using Magma\u2019s F4 algorithm and the application of CryptoMiniSat\u2019s SAT solver. Our experimental results show that increasing the number of keystream bits significantly improves computational efficiency, with the F4 algorithm achieving a speedup of up to 733\u00d7 when additional equations are supplied. Furthermore, we verify the non-existence of equations of degree four or lower for up to seven consecutive keystream bits, and the non-existence of equations of degree three or lower for up to eight consecutive keystream bits, extending prior results on the algebraic properties of E0.",

    "abstract": "We show that using a polynomial representation of prime field elements (PMNS) can be relevant for real-world cryptographic applications even in terms of performance. More specifically, we consider elliptic curves for cryptography when pseudo-Mersenne primes cannot be used to define the base field (e.g. Brainpool standardized curves, JubJub curves in the zkSNARK context, pairing-friendly curves). All these primitives make massive use of the Montgomery reduction algorithm and well-known libraries such as GMP or OpenSSL for base field arithmetic. We show how this arithmetic can be advantageously replaced by a polynomial representation of the number that can be easily parallelized, avoids carry propagation, and allows randomization process. We provide good PMNS basis in the cryptographic context mentioned above, together with a C-implementation that is competitive or faster than GMP and OpenSSL for performing basic operations in the base fields considered. We also integrate this arithmetic into the Rust reference implementation of elliptic curve scalar multiplication for Zero-knowledge applications, and achieve better practical performances for such protocols. This shows that PMNS is an attractive alternative for the base field arithmetic layer in cryptographic primitives using elliptic curves or pairings.",

    "abstract": "Efficient implementation of a pairing-based cryptosystem relies on high-performance arithmetic in finite fields $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ and their extensions $\\mathbb{F}_{p^k}$, where $k$ is the embedding degree. A small embedding degree is crucial because part of the arithmetic for pairing computation occurs in $\\mathbb{F}_{{p}^k}$ and includes operations such as squaring, multiplication, and Frobenius operations.\r\nIn this paper, we present a fast and efficient method for computing the Frobenius endomorphism and its complexity. Additionally, we introduce an improvement in the efficiency of cyclotomic cubing operations for several pairing-friendly elliptic curves, which are essential for the calculation of Tate pairing and its derivatives.",

    "abstract": "Chat groups in secure messaging applications such as Signal, Telegram, and Whatsapp are nowadays used for rapid and widespread dissemination of information to large groups of people. This is common even in sensitive contexts, associated with the organisation of protests, activist groups, and internal company dialogues. Manual administration of who has access to such groups quickly becomes infeasible, in the presence of hundreds or thousands of members.\r\n\r\nWe construct a practical, privacy-preserving reputation system, that automates the approval of new group members based on their reputation amongst the existing membership. We demonstrate security against malicious adversaries in a single-server model, with no further trust assumptions required. Furthermore, our protocol supports arbitrary reputation calculations while almost all group members are offline (as is likely). In addition, we demonstrate the practicality of the approach via an open-source implementation. For groups of size 50 (resp. 200), an admission process on a user that received 40 (resp. 80) scores requires 1312.2 KiB (resp. 5239.4 KiB) of communication, and 3.3s (resp. 16.3s) of overall computation on a single core. While our protocol design matches existing secure messaging applications, we believe it can have value in distributed reputation computation beyond this problem setting.",

    "abstract": "Deniable authentication allows Alice to authenticate a message to Bob, while retaining deniability towards third parties. In particular, not even Bob can convince a third party that Alice authenticated that message. Clearly, in this setting Bob should not be considered trustworthy. Furthermore, deniable authentication is necessary for deniable key exchange, as explicitly desired by Signal and off-the-record (OTR) messaging.\r\n\r\nIn this work we focus on (publicly verifiable) designated verifier signatures (DVS), which are a widely used primitive to achieve deniable authentication. We propose a definition of deniability against malicious verifiers for DVS. We give a construction that achieves this notion in the random oracle (RO) model. Moreover, we show that our notion is not achievable in the standard model with a concrete attack; thereby giving a non-contrived example of the RO heuristic failing.\r\n\r\nAll previous protocols that claim to achieve deniable authentication against malicious verifiers (like Signal's initial handshake protocols X3DH and PQXDH) rely on the Extended Knowledge of Diffie\u2013Hellman (EKDH) assumption. We show that this assumption is broken and that these protocols do not achieve deniability against malicious verifiers.",

    "abstract": "The Sum of Even-Mansour (SoEM) construction, proposed by Chen et al. at Crypto 2019,  has become the basis for designing some symmetric schemes, such as\r\n the nonce-based MAC scheme $\\text{nEHtM}_{p}$ and the nonce-based encryption scheme $\\text{CENCPP}^{\\ast}$.  In this paper, we make the first attempt to study the quantum security of SoEM under the Q1  model where the targeted encryption oracle can only respond to classical queries rather than quantum ones.\r\nFirstly, we propose a quantum key recovery attack on SoEM21 with a time complexity of $\\tilde{O}(2^{n/3})$ along with $O(2^{n/3})$ online classical queries. Compared with the current best classical result which requires $O(2^{2n/3})$, our method offers a quadratic  time  speedup while maintaining the same number of queries. The time complexity of our attack is less than that observed for quantum exhaustive search by a factor of $2^{n/6}$.  We further propose classical and quantum key recovery attacks on  the generalized SoEMs1 construction (consisting of $s\\geq 2$  independent public permutations), revealing that the application of quantum algorithms can provide a quadratic acceleration  over the pure classical methods. Our results also imply that the quantum security of SoEM21 cannot be strengthened merely by increasing  the number of permutations.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of cloud computing and data-driven applications has amplified privacy concerns, driven by the increasing demand to process sensitive data securely. Homomorphic encryption (HE) has become a vital solution for addressing these concerns by enabling computations on encrypted data without revealing its contents. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of two leading HE libraries, SEAL and OpenFHE, examining their performance, usability, and support for prominent HE schemes such as BGV and CKKS.   Our analysis highlights computational efficiency, memory usage, and scalability across Linux and Windows platforms, emphasizing their applicability in real-world scenarios. Results reveal that Linux outperforms Windows in computation efficiency, with OpenFHE emerging as the optimal choice across diverse cryptographic settings. This paper provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners to advance privacy-preserving applications using FHE.",

    "abstract": "The most fundamental performance metrics of secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocols are related to the number of messages the parties exchange (i.e., round complexity), the size of these messages (i.e., communication complexity), and the overall computational resources required to execute the protocol (i.e., computational complexity). Another quality metric of MPC protocols is related to the black-box or non-black-box use of the underlying cryptographic primitives. Indeed, the design of black-box MPC protocols, other than being of theoretical interest, usually can lead to protocols that have better computational complexity.\r\n   \r\n   In this work, we aim to optimize the round and communication complexity of black-box secure multi-party computation in the plain model, by designing a constant-round two-party computation protocol in the malicious setting, whose communication complexity is only polylogarithmic in the size of the function being evaluated. \r\n   We successfully design such a protocol, having only black-box access to fully homomorphic encryption, trapdoor permutations, and hash functions. To the best of our knowledge, our protocol is the first to make black-box use of standard cryptographic primitives while achieving almost asymptotically optimal communication and round complexity.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we revisit the question of key recovery using side-channel analysis for unrolled, single-cycle block ciphers. In particular, we study the Princev2 cipher. While it has been shown vulnerable in multiple previous studies, those studies were performed on side-channel friendly ASICs or older FPGAs (e.g., Xilinx Virtex II on the SASEBO-G board), and using mostly expensive equipment. We start with the goal of exploiting a cheap modern FPGA and board using power traces from a cheap oscilloscope. Particularly, we use Xilinx Artix 7 on the Chipwhisperer CW305 board and PicoScope 5000A, respectively.\r\n\r\nWe split our study into three parts. First, we show that the new set-up still exhibits easily detectable leakage, using a non-specific t-test. Second, we replicate attacks from older FPGAs. Namely, we start with the attack by Yli-M\u00e4yry et al., which is a simple chosen plaintext correlation power analysis attack using divide and conquer. However, we demonstrate that even this simple, powerful attack does not work, demonstrating a peculiar behavior. We study this behavior using a stochastic attack that attempts to extract the leakage model, and we show that models over a small part of the state are inconsistent and depend on more key bits than what is expected. We also attempt classical template attacks and get similar results.\r\n\r\nTo further exploit the leakage, we employ deep learning techniques and succeed in key recovery, albeit using a large number of traces. We perform the explainability technique called Key Guessing Occlusion (KGO) to detect which points the neural networks exploit. When we use these points as features for the classical template attack, although it did not recover the secret key, its performance improves compared to other feature selection techniques.",

    "abstract": "Shor's and Grover's algorithms' efficiency and the advancement of quantum computers imply that the cryptography used until now to protect one's privacy is potentially vulnerable to retrospective decryption, also known as harvest now, decrypt later attack in the near future. This dissertation proposes an overview of the cryptographic schemes used by Tor, highlighting the non-quantum-resistant ones and introducing theoretical performance assessment methods of a local Tor network. The measurement is divided into three phases. We will start with benchmarking a local Tor network simulation on constrained devices to isolate the time taken by classical cryptography processes. Secondly, the analysis incorporates existing benchmarks of quantum-secure algorithms and compares these performances on the devices. Lastly, the estimation of overhead is calculated by replacing the measured times of traditional cryptography with the times recorded for Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) execution within the specified Tor environment. By focusing on the replaceable cryptographic components, using theoretical estimations, and leveraging existing benchmarks, valuable insights into the potential impact of PQC can be obtained without needing to implement it fully.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a systematic study of module lattices. We extend the lattice enumeration algorithm from Euclidean lattices to module lattices, providing a generalized framework.  \r\nTo incorporate the refined analysis by Hanrot and Stehl\u00e8 (CRYPTO'07), we adapt key definitions from Euclidean lattices, such as HKZ-reduced bases and quasi-HKZ-reduced bases, adapting them to the pseudo-basis of modules.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, we revisit the lattice profile, a crucial aspect of enumeration algorithm analysis, and extend its analysis to module lattices.  \r\nAs a result, we improve the asymptotic performance of the module lattice enumeration algorithm and module-SVP.  \r\n\r\nFor instance, let $K = \\mathbb{Q}[x]/\\langle x^d + 1\\rangle$ be a number field with a power-of-two integer $d$, and suppose that $n\\ln n = o(\\ln d)$.  \r\nThen, the nonzero shortest vector in $M \\subset K^n$ can be found in time $d^{\\frac{d}{2e} + o(d)}$, improving upon the previous lattice enumeration bound of $(nd)^{\\frac{nd}{2e}+ o(nd)}$.  \r\n\r\nOur algorithm naturally extends to solving ideal-SVP. Given an ideal $I \\subset R$, where $R = \\mathbb{Z}[x]/\\langle x^t + 1 \\rangle$ with a power-of-two integer $t = nd$, we can find the nonzero shortest element of $I$ in time $\\exp(O(\\frac{t}{2e} \\ln \\ln t))$, improving upon the previous enumeration bound of $\\exp(O(\\frac{t}{2e} \\ln t))$.",

    "abstract": "Key Exchange mechanisms (KE or KEMs) such as the Diffie-Hellman protocol have proved to be a cornerstone conciliating the efficiency of symmetric encryption and the practicality of public key primitives. \r\n    Such designs however assume the non-compromission of the long term asymmetric key in use. To relax this strong security assumption, and allow for modern security features such as Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) or Post Compromise Security (PCS), Ratcheted-KE (RKE) have been proposed.\r\n    This work proposes to turn the Hamming Quasi-Cyclic (HQC) cryptosystem into such a Ratcheted-KE, yielding the first code-based such construction. \r\n    Interestingly, our design allows indifferently one party to update the key on-demand rather than the other, yielding a construction called bi-directional RKE, which compares favorably to generic transformations. \r\n    Finally, we prove that the resulting scheme satisfies the usual correctness and key-indistinguishability properties, and suggest concrete sets of parameters, assuming different real-life use cases.",

    "abstract": "A sequential aggregate signature scheme (SAS) allows multiple potential signers to sequentially aggregate their respective signatures into a single compact signature. Typically, verification of a SAS signatures requires access to all messages and public key pairs utilized in the aggregate generation. However, efficiency is crucial for cryptographic protocols to facilitate their practical implementation. To this end, we propose a sequential aggregate signature scheme with lazy verification for a set of user-message pairs, allowing the verification algorithm to operate without requiring access to all messages and public key pairs in the sequence. This construction is based on the RSA assumption in the random oracle model and is particularly beneficial in resource constrained applications that involve forwarding of authenticated information between parties, such as certificate chains. As an extension of this work, we introduce the notion of sequentially aggregatable proxy re-signatures that enables third parties or proxies to transform aggregatable signatures under one public key to another, useful in applications such as sharing web certificates and authentication of network paths. We also present a construction of a sequential aggregate proxy re-signature scheme, secure in the random oracle model, based on the RSA assumption, which may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "We show the first threshold blind signature scheme and threshold Oblivious PRF (OPRF) scheme which remain secure in the presence of an adaptive adversary, who can adaptively decide which parties to corrupt throughout the lifetime of the scheme.  Moreover, our adaptively secure schemes preserve the minimal round complexity and add only a small computational overhead over prior solutions that offered security only for a much less realistic static adversary, who must choose the subset of corrupted parties before initializing the protocol.\r\n\r\nOur threshold blind signature scheme computes standard BLS signatures while our threshold OPRF computes a very efficient \"2HashDH\" OPRF [JKK14].  We prove adaptive security of both schemes in the Algebraic Group Model (AGM).  Our adaptively secure threshold schemes are as practical as the underlying standard single-server BLS blind signature and 2HashDH OPRF, and they can be used to add cryptographic fault-tolerance and decentralize trust in any system that relies on blind signatures, like anonymous credentials and e-cash, or on OPRF, like the OPAQUE password authentication and the Privacy Pass anonymous authentication scheme, among many others.",

    "abstract": "Hardware obfuscation is an active trustworthy design technique targeting threats in the IC supply chain, such as IP piracy and overproduction. Recent research on Intellectual Property (IP) protection technologies suggests that using embedded reconfigurable components (e.g., eFPGA redaction) could be a promising approach to hide the functional and structural information of security-critical designs. However, such techniques suffer from almost prohibitive overhead in terms of area, power, delay, and testability. This paper proposes an obfuscation technique called EvoLUTe+, which is a unique and more fine-grained redaction approach using smaller reconfigurable components (e.g., Look-Up Tables (LUTs)). EvoLUTe+ achieves fine-grained partitioning, sub-circuit coloring, and scoring of IP, and then encrypts the original IP through the substitution of some sub-circuits. Different attacks are used to test the robustness of EvoLUTe+, including structural and machine learning attacks, as well as Bounded Model Checking (BMC) attacks. The overhead of the obfuscation design is also analyzed. Experimental results demonstrate that EvoLUTe+ exhibits robustness with acceptable overhead while resisting such threat models.",

    "abstract": "McEliece cryptosystems, based on code-based cryptography, is a candidate in Round 4 of NIST's post-quantum cryptography standardization process. The QC-MDPC (quasi-cyclic moderate-density parity-check) variant is particularly noteworthy due to its small key length. The Guo-Johansson-Stankovski (GJS) attack against the QC-MDPC McEliece cryptosystem was recently proposed and has intensively been studied. This attack reconstructs the secret key using information on decoding error rate (DER). However, in practice, obtaining complete DER information is presumed to be time-consuming. This paper proposes two algorithms to reconstruct the secret key under imperfection in the DER information and evaluates the relationship between the imperfection and efficiency of key reconstruction.

    "abstract": "One-shot signatures (OSS) were defined by Amos, Georgiou, Kiayias, and Zhandry (STOC'20). These allow for signing exactly one message, after which the signing key self-destructs, preventing a second message from ever being signed. While such an object is impossible classically, Amos et al observe that OSS may be possible using quantum signing keys by leveraging the no-cloning principle. OSS has since become an important conceptual tool with many applications in decentralized settings and for quantum cryptography with classical communication. OSS are also closely related to separations between classical-binding and collapse-binding for post-quantum hashing and commitments. Unfortunately, the only known OSS construction due to Amos et al. was only justified in a classical oracle model, and moreover their justification was ultimately found to contain a fatal bug. Thus, the existence of OSS, even in a classical idealized model, has remained open. \r\n\r\nWe give the first standard-model OSS, with provable security assuming (sub-exponential) indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) and LWE. This also gives the first standard-model separation between classical and collapse-binding post-quantum commitments/hashing, solving a decade-old open problem. Along the way, we also give the first construction with unconditional security relative to a classical oracle. To achieve our standard-model construction, we develop a notion of permutable pseudorandom permutations (permutable PRPs), and show how they are useful for translating oracle proofs involving random permutations into obfuscation-based proofs. In particular, obfuscating permutable PRPs gives a trapdoor one-way permutation that is $\\textit{full-domain}$, solving another decade-old-problem of constructing this object from (sub-exponential) iO and one-way functions.",

    "abstract": "Multi-party computation (MPC) has become increasingly practical in the last two decades, solving privacy and security issues in various domains, such as healthcare, finance, and machine learning. One big caveat is that MPC sometimes lacks usability since the knowledge barrier for regular users can be high. Users have to deal with, e.g., various CLI tools, private networks, and sometimes even must install many dependencies, which are often hardware-dependent.\r\n\r\nA solution to improve the usability of MPC is to build browser-based MPC engines where each party runs within a browser window. Two examples of such an MPC web engine are JIFF and the web variant of MPyC. Both support an honest majority with passive corruptions.\r\n\r\n$\\texttt{webSPDZ}$: Our work brings one of the most performant and versatile general-purpose MPC engines, MP-SPDZ, to the web. MP-SPDZ supports \u226540 MPC protocols with different security models, enabling many security models on the web. To port MP-SPDZ to the web, we use Emscripten to compile MP-SPDZ\u2019s C++ BackEnd to WebAssembly and upgrade the party communication for the browser (WebRTC or WebSockets). We call the new MPC web engine webSPDZ. As with the native versions of the mentioned MPC web engines, MPyC-Web and JIFF, webSPDZ outperforms them in our end-to-end experiments.\r\n\r\nWe believe that webSPDZ brings forth many interesting and practically relevant use cases. Thus, webSPDZ pushes the boundaries of practical MPC: making MPC more usable and enabling it for a broader community.",

    "abstract": "Black-box separations are a cornerstone of cryptography, indicating barriers to various goals. A recent line of work has explored black-box separations for quantum cryptographic primitives. Namely, a number of separations are known in the Common Haar Random State (CHRS) model, though this model is not considered a complete separation, but rather a starting point. A few very recent works have attempted to lift these separations to a unitary separation, which are considered complete separations. Unfortunately, we find significant errors in some of these lifting results.\r\n\r\nWe prove general conditions under which CHRS separations can be generically lifted, thereby giving simple, modular, and bug-free proofs of complete unitary separations between various quantum primitives. Our techniques allow for simpler proofs of existing separations as well as new separations that were previously only known in the CHRS model.",

    "abstract": "We revisit the problem of secure aggregation of high-dimensional vectors in a two-server system such as Prio. These systems are typically used to aggregate vectors such as gradients in private federated learning, where the aggregate itself is protected via noise addition to ensure differential privacy. Existing approaches require communication scaling with the dimensionality, and thus limit the dimensionality of vectors one can efficiently process in this setup.\r\n\r\nWe propose PREAMBLE: Private Efficient Aggregation Mechanism for  Block-sparse Euclidean Vectors. PREAMBLE is a novel extension of distributed point functions that enables communication- and computation-efficient aggregation of block-sparse vectors, which are sparse vectors where the non-zero entries occur in a small number of clusters of consecutive coordinates. We then show that PREAMBLE can be combined with random sampling and privacy amplification by sampling results, to allow asymptotically optimal privacy-utility trade-offs for vector aggregation, at a fraction of the communication cost. When coupled with recent advances in numerical privacy accounting, our approach incurs a negligible overhead in noise variance, compared to the Gaussian mechanism used with Prio.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of video streams as a primary medium for communication and the demand for high-quality video sharing over the internet have given rise to several security and privacy issues, such as unauthorized access and data breaches. To address these limitations, various Selective Video Encryption (SVE) schemes have been proposed, which encrypt specific portions of a video while leaving others unencrypted. The SVE approach balances security and usability, granting unauthorized users access to certain parts while encrypting sensitive content. However, existing SVE schemes adopt an all-or-nothing coarse-grain encryption approach, where a user with a decryption key can access all the contents of a given video stream. This paper proposes and designs a fine-grained access control-based selective video encryption scheme, ABSVE, and a use-case protocol called \\protocol. Our scheme encrypts different identified Regions of Interest (ROI) with a unique symmetric key and applies a Ciphertext Policy Attribute Based Encryption (CP-ABE) scheme to tie these keys to specific access policies. This method provides multiple access levels for a single encrypted video stream. Crucially, we provide a formal syntax and security definitions for ABSVE, allowing for rigorous security analysis of this and similar schemes --  which is absent in prior works. Finally, we provide an implementation and evaluation of our protocol in the Kvazaar HEVC encoder. Overall, our constructions enhance security and privacy while allowing controlled access to video content and achieve comparable efficiency to compression without encryption.",

    "abstract": "Hyperledger Fabric is a unique permissioned platform for implementing blockchain in a consortium. It has a distinct transaction flow of execute-order-validate. During the execution phase, a pre-determined set of endorsing peers execute a transaction and sign the transaction response. This process is termed endorsement. In the validation phase, peers validate the transaction with reference to an endorsement policy. The identity of the endorsing organizations is obtainable to all the nodes in the network through the endorser signature and endorsement policy. Knowing this has led to serious vulnerabilities in the blockchain network.\r\nIn this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving endorsement system which conceals both endorser signature and endorsement policy. Endorser is anonymized by replacing the signature scheme with a scoped-linkable threshold ring signature scheme. Endorsement policy is secured using Pedersen commitments and non-interactive proof of knowledge of integer vector. We also achieve efficiency in the computation by employing non-interactive proof of co-prime roots. We provide the necessary security analysis to prove that the proposed work guarantees anonymity and unlinkability properties. A comparative analysis of our work with an existing framework is provided which shows that the proposed scheme offers higher level of security and it is optimal in terms of efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The Chou-Orlandi batch oblivious transfer (OT) protocol is a particularly attractive OT protocol that bridges the gap between practical efficiency and strong security guarantees and is especially notable due to its simplicity. The security analysis provided by Chou and Orlandi bases the security of their protocol on the hardness of the computational Diffie-Hellman ($\\mathsf{CDH}$) problem in prime-order groups. Concretely, in groups in which no better-than-generic algorithms are known for the $\\mathsf{CDH}$ problem, their security analysis yields that an attacker running in time $t$ and issuing $q$ random-oracle queries breaks the security of their protocol with probability at most $\\epsilon \\leq q^2 \\cdot t / 2^{\\kappa/2}$, where $\\kappa$ is the bit-length of the group's order. This concrete bound, however, is somewhat insufficient for 256-bit groups (e.g., for $\\kappa = 256$, it does not provide any guarantee already for $t = 2^{48}$ and $q = 2^{40}$). \r\n\r\nIn this work, we establish a tighter concrete security bound for the Chou-Orlandi protocol. First, we introduce the list square Diffie-Hellman ($\\ell\\text{-}\\mathsf{sqDH}$) problem and present a tight reduction from the security of the protocol to the hardness of solving $\\ell\\text{-}\\mathsf{sqDH}$. That is, we completely shift the task of analyzing the concrete security of the protocol to that of analyzing the concrete hardness of the $\\ell\\text{-}\\mathsf{sqDH}$ problem. Second, we reduce the hardness of the $\\ell\\text{-}\\mathsf{sqDH}$ problem to that of the decisional Diffie-Hellman ($\\mathsf{DDH}$) problem without incurring a multiplicative loss. Our key observation is that although $\\mathsf{CDH}$ and $\\mathsf{DDH}$ have the same assumed concrete hardness, relying on the hardness of $\\mathsf{DDH}$ enables our reduction to efficiently test the correctness of the solutions it produces. \r\n\r\nConcretely, in groups in which no better-than-generic algorithms are known for the $\\mathsf{DDH}$ problem, our analysis yields that an attacker running in time $t$ and issuing $q \\leq t$ random-oracle queries breaks the security of the Chou-Orlandi protocol with probability at most $\\epsilon \\leq t / 2^{\\kappa/2}$ (i.e., we eliminate the above multiplicative $q^2$ term). We prove our results within the standard real-vs-ideal framework considering static corruptions by malicious adversaries, and provide a concrete security treatment by accounting for the statistical distance between a real-model execution and an ideal-model execution.",

    "abstract": "Side-channel vulnerabilities pose an increasing threat to cryptographically protected devices. Consequently, it is crucial to observe information leakages through physical parameters such as power consumption and electromagnetic (EM) radiation to reduce susceptibility during interactions with cryptographic functions. EM side-channel attacks are becoming more prevalent. PRESENT is a promising lightweight cryptographic algorithm expected to be incorporated into Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in the future. This research investigates the EM side-channel robustness of PRESENT using a correlation attack model. This work extends our previous Correlation EM Analysis (CEMA) of PRESENT with improved results. The attack targets the Substitution box (S-box) and can retrieve 8 bytes of the 10-byte encryption key with a minimum of 256 EM waveforms. This paper presents the process of EM attack modelling, encompassing both simple and correlation attacks, followed by a critical analysis.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Differential Fault Attacks (DFAs) have proven highly effective against stream ciphers designed for Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption (HHE). In this work, we present a table-based DFA framework called the \\textit{shortcut attack}, which generalizes the attack proposed by Wang and Tang on the cipher \\textsf{Elisabeth}. \r\nThe framework applies to a broad sub-family of ciphers following the Group Filter Permutator (GFP) paradigm and enhances previous DFAs by improving both the fault identification and path generation steps. Notably, the shortcut attack circumvents the issue of function representation, allowing successful attacks even when the cipher's filter function cannot be represented over the ring it is defined on.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we provide complexity estimates for the framework and apply the shortcut attack to \\textsf{Elisabeth-4} and its patches. As a result, we optimize the DFA on \\textsf{Elisabeth-4}, requiring fewer keystreams and running faster than previous methods. Specifically, we achieve a DFA that requires only $3000$ keystreams, which is one-fifth of the previous best result. We also successfully mount a practical DFA on \\textsf{Gabriel-4} and provide a theoretical DFA for \\textsf{Elisabeth-b4}.\r\n\r\nFor the latest patch, \\textsf{Margrethe-18-4}, which follows the more general Mixed Filter Permutator (MFP) paradigm, we present a DFA in a stronger model. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first DFA results on the patches of \\textsf{Elisabeth-4}. Finally, we derive security margins to prevent shortcut attacks on a broad sub-family of MFP ciphers, which can serve as parameter recommendations for designers.",

    "abstract": "Scloud+ is an unstructured LWE-based key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) with conservative quantum security, in which ternary secrets and lattice coding are incorporated for higher computational and communication efficiency. However, its efficiencies are still much inferior to those of the structured LWE-based KEM, like ML-KEM (standardized by NIST). In this paper, we present a configurable hardware architecture for Scloud+.KEM to improve the computational efficiency. Many algorithmic and architectural co-optimizations are proposed to reduce the complexity and increase the degree of parallelism. Specially, the matrix multiplications are computed by a block in serial and the block is calculated in one cycle, without using any multipliers. In addition, the random bits all are generated by an unfolded Keccak core, well matched with the data flow required by the block matrix multiplier. The proposed design is coded in Verilog and implemented under the SMIC 40nm LP CMOS technology. The synthesized results show that Scloud+.KEM-128 only costs 23.0 $us$, 24.3 $us$, and 24.6 $us$ in the KeyGen, Encaps, and Decaps stages, respectively, with an area consumption of 0.69 $mm^2$, significantly narrowing the gap with the state-of-the-art of Kyber hardware implementation.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we provide new theoretical and empirical evidences that gradient-based deep learning profiling attacks (DL-SCA) suffer from masking schemes. This occurs through an initial stall of the learning process: the so-called plateau effect. To understand why, we derive an analytical expression of a DL-SCA model targeting simulated traces which enables us to study an analytical expression of the loss. By studying the loss landscape of this model, we show that not only do the magnitudes of the gradients decrease as the order of masking increases, but the loss landscape also exhibits a prominent saddle point interfering with the optimization process. From these observations, we (1) propose the usage of a second-order optimization algorithm mitigating the impact of low-gradient areas. In addition, we show how to leverage the intrinsic sparsity of valuable information in SCA traces to better pose the DL-SCA problem. To do so, we (2) propose to use the implicit regularization properties of the sparse mirror descent. These propositions are gathered in a new publicly available optimization algorithm, Scoop. Scoop combines second-order derivative of the loss function in the optimization process, with a sparse stochastic mirror descent. We experimentally show that Scoop pushes further the current limitations of DL-SCA against simulated traces, and outperforms the state-of-the-art on the ASCADv1 dataset in terms of number of traces required to retrieve the key, perceived information and plateau length. Scoop also performs the first non-worst-case attack on the ASCADv2 dataset. On simulated traces, we show that using Scoop reduces the DL-SCA time complexity by the equivalent of one masking order.",

    "abstract": "Side-channel analysis (SCA) is a growing field in\r\nhardware security where adversaries extract secret information\r\nfrom embedded devices by measuring physical observables like\r\npower consumption and electromagnetic emanation. SCA is a\r\nsecurity assessment method used by governmental labs, standardization\r\nbodies, and researchers, where testing is not just\r\nlimited to standardized cryptographic circuits, but it is expanded\r\nto AI accelerators, Post Quantum circuits, systems, etc. Despite\r\nits importance, SCA is performed on an ad hoc basis in the\r\nsense that its flow is not systematically optimized and unified\r\namong labs. As a result, the current solutions do not account\r\nfor fair comparisons between analyses. Furthermore, neglecting\r\nthe need for interoperability between datasets and SCA metric\r\ncomputation increases students\u2019 barriers to entry. To address\r\nthis, we introduce SCAPEgoat, a Python-based SCA library\r\nwith three key modules devoted to defining file format, capturing\r\ninterfaces, and metric calculation. The custom file framework\r\norganizes side-channel traces using JSON for metadata, offering\r\na hierarchical structure similar to HDF5 commonly applied in\r\nSCA, but more flexible and human-readable. The metadata can\r\nbe queried with regular expressions, a feature unavailable in\r\nHDF5. Secondly, we incorporate memory-efficient SCA metric\r\ncomputations, which allow using our functions on resource-restricted\r\nmachines. This is accomplished by partitioning datasets\r\nand leveraging statistics-based optimizations on the metrics. In\r\ndoing so, SCAPEgoat makes the SCA more accessible to newcomers\r\nso that they can learn techniques and conduct experiments\r\nfaster and with the possibility to expand on in the future.",

    "abstract": "DNA edit distance (ED) measures the minimum number of single nucleotide insertions, substitutions, or deletions required to convert a DNA sequence into another. ED has broad applications in healthcare such as sequence alignment, genome assembly, functional annotation, and drug discovery. Privacy-preserving computation is essential in this context to protect sensitive genomic data. Nonetheless, the existing secure DNA edit distance solutions lack efficiency when handling large data sequences or resort to approximations and fail to accurately compute the metric.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we introduce secureED, a protocol that tackles these limitations, resulting in a significant performance enhancement of approximately $2-24\\times$ compared to existing methods. Our protocol computes a secure ED between two genomes, each comprising $1,000$ letters, in just a few seconds. The underlying technique of our protocol is a novel approach that transforms the established approximate matching technique (i.e., the Ukkonen algorithm) into exact matching, exploiting the inherent similarity in human DNA to achieve cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, we introduce various optimizations tailored for secure computation in scenarios with a limited input domain, such as DNA sequences composed solely of the four nucleotide letters.",

    "abstract": "Due to their simple security assessments, permutation-based pseudo-random functions (PRFs) have become widely used in cryptography. It has been shown that PRFs using a single $n$-bit permutation achieve $n/2$ bits of security, while those using two permutation calls provide $2n/3$ bits of security in the classical setting. This paper studies the security of permutation-based PRFs within the Q1 model, where attackers are restricted to classical queries and offline quantum computations. We present improved quantum-time/classical-data tradeoffs compared with the previous attacks. Specifically, under the same assumptions/hardware as Grover's exhaustive search attack, i.e. the offline Simon algorithm, we can recover keys in quantum time $\\tilde{O}(2^{n/3})$, with $O(2^{n/3})$ classical queries and $O(n^2)$ qubits. Furthermore, we enhance previous superposition attacks by reducing the data complexity from exponential to polynomial, while maintaining the same time complexity. This implies that permutation-based PRFs become vulnerable when adversaries have access to quantum computing resources. It is pointed out that the above quantum attack can be used to quite a few cryptography, including PDMMAC and pEDM, as well as general instantiations like XopEM, EDMEM, EDMDEM, and others.",

    "abstract": "Registration-based encryption (RBE) is a recently developed alternative to identity-based encryption, that mitigates the well-known key-escrow problem by letting each user sample its own key pair. In RBE, the key authority is substituted by a key curator, a completely transparent entity whose only job is to reliably aggregate users' keys. However, one limitation of all known RBE scheme is that they all rely on one-time trusted setup, that must be computed honestly. \r\n    \r\n    In this work, we ask whether this limitation is indeed inherent and we initiate the systematic study of RBE in the plain model, without any common reference string. We present the following main results:\r\n        - (Definitions) We show that the standard security definition of RBE is unachievable without a trusted setup and we propose a slight weakening, where one honest user is required to be registered in the system.\r\n        - (Constructions) We present constructions of RBE in the plain model, based on standard cryptographic assumptions. Along the way, we introduce the notions of non-interactive witness indistinguishable (NIWI) proofs secure against chosen statements attack and re-randomizable RBE, which may be of independent interest.\r\n        A major limitation of our constructions, is that users must be updated upon every new registration. \r\n        - (Lower Bounds) We show that this limitation is in some sense inherent. We prove that any RBE in the plain model that satisfies a certain structural requirement, which holds for all known RBE constructions, must update all but a vanishing fraction of the users, upon each new registration. This is in contrast with the standard RBE settings, where users receive a logarithmic amount of updates throughout the lifetime of the system.",

    "abstract": "This work introduce a new approach called Max bias analysis for the entropy computation of structures of Free Ring Oscillator-based Physical Random Number Generator. It employs the stochastic model based on the well-established Wiener process, specifically adapted to only capture thermal noise contributions while accounting for potential non-zero bias in the duty cycle.\r\nOur analysis is versatile, applicable to combinations of multiple sampled Ring Oscillator (RO) filtering by any function. The entropy computation takes as inputs the parameters of the thermal stochastic model and delivers directly a proven bound for both Shannon entropy and min-entropy to fulfill AIS31 and NIST SP 800-90 B. As an example, we apply the new methodology on an enhanced structure of TRNG combining several free-running Ring Oscillators filtered by a vectorial function built from a linear error correcting code that optimizes the functional performance in terms of [entropy rate/silicium area used] and that maintains the mathematical proof of the entropy lower bound as simple as possible.",

    "abstract": "We describe a strategy for a nation to acquire majority stake in Bitcoin with zero cost to the taxpayers of the nation. We propose a bitcoin fork sponsored by the the government of the nation, and backed by the full faith of treasury of the nation, such that the genesis block of this fork attributes fixed large amount of new kinds of tokens called strategic-reserve-bitcoin tokens (SRBTC) to the nation's treasury, which is some  multiple (greater than one) of the amount of all Bitcoin tokens (BTC) currently set in the Bitcoin protocol. The BTC tokens continue to be treated 1:1 as SRBTC tokens in the forked chain. The only capital that the nation puts up is its explicit guarantee that the SRBTC tokens of the fork will be accepted as legal tender, such as payment of tax to the treasury.\r\n\r\nWe suggest that this is a better approach than starting a new blockchain that mimics Bitcoin, as it will be  partially fair to the current holders of Bitcoin, which in turn would make it competitive in the space of other such possible forks by other powerful nations. Moreover, such a proof-of-work blockchain  retains its egalitarian and democratic nature, which competitively deters the said nation from any dilutions in the future. \r\n\r\nTo justify our proposal we setup three competitive games, and show strategies for different players that are in Nash equilibrium and which throw further light on these claims. In particular, \r\n\r\n1. The first game shows that if the only two alternatives for investors is to invest in BTC or SRBTC, then individuals who have a certain fraction $\\theta$ of their wealth already invested in BTC, will invest new money in the original chain, whereas the individuals whose current wealth invested in BTC is less than the $\\theta$ fraction will invest new money in SRBTC.\r\n2. The second game shows that if there is a third alternative for investment, which is cash that is losing value (inflation-adjusted) by a percentage $d$, then the investors who had less than $\\theta$ fraction of wealth in Bitcoin, will invest in SRBTC only if the dilution of SRBTC is large enough (as an increasing (linear) function of $1/d$). Here by dilution we mean the new SRBTC tokens that are allowed to be eventually mined in the fork.\r\n3.  The third game shows that investors would prefer a fork of Bitcoin over a replica of Bitcoin that doesn't value original BTC, when both are available and even if both are backed similarly by one or more nations.",

In this paper, we introduce a Systemization of Knowledge of the Estonian IVXV i-voting system and propose some added security enhancements. The presented SoK includes applications implemented by election observers in 2023 & 2024 elections, which, to our knowledge, has never been mentioned and/or analyzed in the academic literature before. The paper also updates the general knowledge about an extra right given to auditors \r\n(but not observers) in the June 2024 European election, recent complaints, and about newer solutions suggested by academia in 2024. Finally, we discuss the current system status in 2024 EP elections and propose our own suggestions to some problems stated in the OSCE-ODIHR 2023 report that are still there.",

    "abstract": "Zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs have been recently explored for the integrity of machine learning (ML) inference. However, these protocols suffer from high computational overhead, with the primary bottleneck stemming from the evaluation of non-linear functions. In this paper, we propose the first systematic ZK proof framework for non-linear mathematical functions in ML using the perspective of table lookup. The key challenge is that table lookup cannot be directly applied to non-linear functions in ML since it would suffer from inefficiencies due to the intolerably large table. Therefore, we carefully design several important building blocks, including digital decomposition, comparison, and truncation, such that they can effectively utilize table lookup with a quite small table size while ensuring the soundness of proofs. Based on these blocks, we implement complex mathematical operations and further construct ZK proofs for current mainstream non-linear functions in ML such as ReLU, sigmoid, and normalization. The extensive experimental evaluation shows that our framework achieves 50 \u223c 179\u00d7 runtime improvement compared to the state-of-the-art work, while maintaining a similar level of communication efficiency.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we study the communication complexity of constant-round secure multiparty computation (MPC) against a fully malicious adversary and consider both the honest majority setting and the dishonest majority setting. In the (strong) honest majority setting (where $t=(1/2-\\epsilon)n$ for a constant $\\epsilon$), the best-known result without relying on FHE is given by Beck et al. (CCS 2023) based on the LPN assumption that achieves $O(|C|\\kappa)$ communication, where $\\kappa$ is the security parameter and the achieved communication complexity is independent of the number of participants. In the dishonest majority setting, the best-known result is achieved by Goyal et al. (ASIACRYPT 2024), which requires $O(|C|n\\kappa)$ bits of communication and is based on the DDH and LPN assumptions.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we achieve the following results: (1) For any constant $\\epsilon<1$, we give the first constant-round MPC in the dishonest majority setting for corruption threshold $t<(1-\\epsilon)n$ with $O(|C|\\kappa+D (n+\\kappa)^2\\kappa)$ communication assuming random oracles and oblivious transfers, where $D$ is the circuit depth. (2) We give the first constant-round MPC in the standard honest majority setting (where $t=(n-1)/2$) with $O(|C|\\kappa+D (n+\\kappa)^2\\kappa)$ communication only assuming random oracles. \r\n\r\nUnlike most of the previous constructions of constant-round MPCs that are based on multiparty garbling, we achieve our result by letting each party garble his local computation in a non-constant-round MPC that meets certain requirements. We first design a constant-round MPC that achieves $O(|C|\\kappa + Dn^2\\kappa)$ communication assuming random oracles in the strong honest majority setting of $t=n/4$. Then, we combine the party virtualization technique and the idea of MPC-in-the-head to boost the corruption threshold to $t<(1-\\epsilon)n$ for any constant $\\epsilon<1$ assuming oblivious transfers to achieve our first result. Finally, our second result is obtained by instantiating oblivious transfers using a general honest-majority MPC and the OT extension technique built on random oracles.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has recently emerged as one of the leading paradigms for collaborative machine learning, serving as a tool for model computation without a need to expose one\u2019s privately stored data. However, despite its advantages, FL systems face severe challenges within its own security solutions that address both privacy and robustness of models. This paper focuses on vulnerabilities within the domain of FL security with emphasis on model-robustness. Identifying critical gaps in current defences, particularly against adaptive adversaries which modify their attack strategies after being disconnected and rejoin systems to continue attacks. To our knowledge, other surveys in this domain do not cover the concept of adaptive adversaries, this along with the significance of their impact serves as the main motivation for this work. Our contributions are fivefold: (1) we present a comprehensive overview of FL systems, presenting a complete summary of its fundamental building blocks, (2) an extensive overview of existing vulnerabilities that target FL systems in general, (3) highlight baseline attack vectors as well as state-of-the-art approaches to development of attack methods and defence mechanisms, (4) introduces a novel baseline method of attack leveraging reconnecting malicious clients, and (5) identifies future research directions to address and counter adaptive attacks. We demonstrate through experimental results that existing baseline secure aggregation rules used in other works for comparison such as Krum and Trimmed Mean are insufficient against those attacks. Further, works improving upon those algorithms do not address this concern either. Our findings serve as a basis for redefining FL security paradigms in the direction of adaptive adversaries.",

    "abstract": "Single Sign-On (SSO) is a popular authentication mechanism enabling users to access multiple web services with a single set of credentials. Despite its convenience, SSO faces outstanding privacy challenges. The Identity Provider (IdP) represents a single point of failure and can track users across different Relying Parties (RPs). Multiple colluding RPs may track users through common identity attributes. In response, anonymous credential-based SSO solutions have emerged to offer privacy-preserving authentication without revealing unnecessary user information. However, these solutions face two key challenges: supporting RP authentication without compromising user unlinkability and maintaining compatibility with the predominant Authorization Code Flow (ACF).\r\n\r\nThis paper introduces VeriSSO, a novel SSO protocol based on verifiable credentials (VC) that supports RP authentication while preserving privacy and avoiding single points of failure. VeriSSO employs an independent authentication server committee to manage RP and user authentication, binding RP authentication with credential-based anonymous user authentication. This approach ensures user unlinkability while supporting RP authentication and allows RPs to continue using their existing verification routines with identity tokens as in the ACF workflow. VeriSSO's design also supports lawful de-anonymization, ensuring user accountability for misbehavior during anonymity. Experimental evaluations of VeriSSO demonstrate its efficiency and practicality, with authentication processes completed within 100 milliseconds.",

    "abstract": "The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) delivers both confidentiality and integrity yet poses performance and security challenges on resource-limited microcontrollers. In this paper, we present an optimized AES-GCM implementation for the ARM Cortex-M4 that combines Fixslicing AES with the FACE (Fast AES-CTR Encryption) strategy, significantly reducing redundant computations in AES-CTR. We further examine two GHASH implementations\u2014a 4-bit Table-based approach and a Karatsuba-based constant-time variant\u2014to balance speed, memory usage, and resistance to timing attacks. Our evaluations on an STM32F4 microcontroller show that Fixslicing+FACE reduces AES-128 GCTR cycle counts by up to 19.41\\%, while the Table-based GHASH achieves nearly double the speed of its Karatsuba counterpart. These results confirm that, with the right mix of bitslicing optimizations, counter-mode caching, and lightweight polynomial multiplication, secure and efficient AES-GCM can be attained even on low-power embedded devices.",

    "abstract": "This paper formalizes the notion of server-aided anonymous credentials (SAACs), a new model for anonymous credentials (ACs) where, in the process of showing a credential, the holder is helped by additional auxiliary information generated in an earlier (anonymous) interaction with the issuer. This model enables lightweight instantiations of 'publicly verifiable and multi-use' ACs from pairing-free elliptic curves, which is important for compliance with existing national standards. A recent candidate for the EU Digital Identity Wallet, BBS#, roughly adheres to the SAAC model we have developed; however, it lacks formal security definitions and proofs.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we provide rigorous definitions of security for SAACs, and show how to realize SAACs from the weaker notion of keyed-verification ACs (KVACs) and special types of oblivious issuance protocols for zero-knowledge proofs. We instantiate this paradigm to obtain two constructions: one achieves statistical anonymity with unforgeability under the Gap $q$-SDH assumption, and the other achieves computational anonymity and unforgeability under the DDH assumption.",

    "abstract": "We present a unifying framework for proving the knowledge-soundness of KZG-like polynomial commitment schemes, encompassing both univariate and multivariate variants. By conceptualizing the proof technique of Lipmaa, Parisella, and Siim for the univariate KZG scheme (EUROCRYPT 2024), we present tools and falsifiable hardness assumptions that permit black-box extraction of the multivariate KZG scheme. Central to our approach is the notion of a canonical Proof-of-Knowledge of a Polynomial (PoKoP) of a polynomial commitment scheme, which we use to capture the extractability notion required in constructions of practical zk-SNARKs. We further present an explicit polynomial decomposition lemma for multivariate polynomials, enabling a more direct analysis of interpolating extractors and bridging the gap between univariate and multivariate commitments. Our results provide the first standard-model proofs of extractability for the multivariate KZG scheme and many of its variants under falsifiable assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Sigma protocols ($\\Sigma$-protocols) provide a foundational paradigm for constructing secure algorithms in privacy-preserving applications. To enhance efficiency, several extended models [BG18], [BBB+18], [AC20] incorporating various optimization techniques have been proposed as ``replacements'' for the original $\\Sigma$-protocol. However, these models often lack the expressiveness needed to handle complex relations and hinder designers from applying appropriate instantiation and optimization strategies.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel compressed $\\Sigma$-protocol model that effectively addresses these limitations by providing concrete constructions for relations involving non-linear constraints. Our approach is sufficiently expressive to encompass a wide range of relations. Central to our model is the definition of doubly folded commitments, which, along with a proposed Argument of Knowledge, generalizes the compression and amortization processes found in previous models. Despite the ability to express more relations, this innovation also provides a foundation to discuss a general aggregation technique, optimizing the proof size of instantiated schemes. \r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the above statements, we provide a brief review of several existing protocols that can be instantiated using our model to demonstrate the versatility of our construction. We also present use cases where our generalized model enhances applications traditionally considered ``less compact'', such as binary proofs [BCC+15] and $k$-out-of-$n$ proofs [ACF21]. In conclusion, our new model offers a more efficient and expressive alternative to the current use of $\\Sigma$-protocols, paving the way for broader applicability and optimization in cryptographic applications.",

    "abstract": "Group actions have emerged as a powerful framework in post-quantum cryptography, serving as the foundation for various cryptographic primitives. The Lattice Isomorphism Problem (LIP) has recently gained attention as a promising hardness assumption for designing quantum-resistant protocols. Its formulation as a group action has opened the door to new cryptographic applications, including a commitment scheme and a linkable ring signatures.\r\nIn this work, we analyze the security properties of the LIP group action and present new findings. Specifically, we demonstrate that it fails to satisfy the weak unpredictability and weak pseudorandomness properties when the adversary has access to as few as three and two instances with the same secret, respectively. This significantly improves upon prior analysis by Budroni et al. (PQCrypto 2024).\r\nAs a direct consequence of our findings, we reveal a vulnerability in the linkable ring signature scheme proposed by Khuc et al. (SPACE 2024), demonstrating that the hardness assumption underlying the linkable anonymity property does not hold.",

    "abstract": "We revisit the question of minimizing the proof length of designated-verifier succinct non-interactive arguments (dv-SNARGs) in the generic group model. Barta et al. (Crypto 2020) constructed such dv-SNARGs with inverse-polynomial soundness in which the proof consists of only two group elements. For negligible soundness, all previous constructions required a super-constant number of group elements.\r\n\r\n    We show that one group element suffices for negligible soundness. Concretely, we obtain dv-SNARGs (in fact, dv-SNARKs) with $2^{-\\tau}$ soundness where proofs consist of one element of a generic group $\\mathbb G$ and $O(\\tau)$ additional bits. In particular, the proof length in group elements is constant even with $1/|\\mathbb G|$ soundness error. \r\n    \r\n    In more concrete terms, compared to the best known SNARGs using bilinear groups, we get dv-SNARGs with roughly $2$x shorter proofs (with $2^{-80}$ soundness at a $128$-bit security level). We are not aware of any practically feasible proof systems that achieve similar succinctness, even fully interactive or heuristic ones. \r\n\r\n    Our technical approach is based on a novel combination of techniques for trapdoor hash functions and group-based homomorphic secret sharing with linear multi-prover interactive proofs.",

    "abstract": "A secret-sharing scheme is a method by which a dealer distributes shares to parties such that only authorized subsets of parties can reconstruct the secret. Secret-sharing schemes are an important tool in cryptography and they are used as a building block in many secure protocols, e.g., secure multiparty computation protocols for arbitrary functionalities, Byzantine agreement, threshold cryptography, access control, attribute-based encryption, and weighted cryptography (e.g., stake-based blockchains). The collection of authorized sets that should be able to reconstruct the secret is called an access structure. The main goal in secret sharing is to minimize the share size in a scheme realizing an access structure. In most of this monograph, we will consider secret-sharing schemes with information-theoretic security, i.e., schemes in which unauthorized sets cannot deduce any information on the secret even when the set has unbounded computational power. Although research on secret-sharing schemes has been conducted for nearly 40 years, we still do not know what the optimal share size required to realize an arbitrary \ud835\udc5b-party access structure is; there is an exponential gap between the best known upper bounds and the best known lower bounds on the share size.\r\n\r\nIn this monograph, we review the most important topics on secret sharing. We start by discussing threshold secret-sharing schemes in which the authorized sets are all sets whose size is at least some threshold \ud835\udc61; these are the most useful secret-sharing schemes. We then describe efficient constructions of secret-sharing schemes for general access structures; in particular, we describe constructions of linear secret-sharing schemes from monotone formulas and monotone span programs and provide a simple construction for arbitrary \ud835\udc5b-party access structures with share size 2\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b for some constant \ud835\udc50 < 1. To demonstrate the importance of secret-sharing schemes, we show how they are used to construct secure multi-party computation protocols for arbitrary functions. We next discuss the main problem with known secret-sharing schemes \u2013 the large share size, which is exponential in the number of parties. We present the known lower bounds on the share size. These lower bounds are fairly weak, and there is a big gap between the lower and upper bounds. For linear secret-sharing schemes, which are a class of schemes based on linear algebra that contains most known schemes, exponential lower bounds on the share size are known. We then turn to study ideal secret-sharing schemes in which the share size of each party is the same as the size of the secret; these schemes are the most efficient secret-sharing schemes. We describe a characterization of the access structures that have ideal schemes via matroids. Finally, we discuss computational secret-sharing schemes, i.e., secret-sharing schemes that are secure only against polynomial-time adversaries. We show computational schemes for monotone and non-monotone circuits; these constructions are more efficient than the best known schemes with information-theoretic security.",

    "abstract": "Efficiently protecting embedded software implementations of standard symmetric cryptographic primitives against side-channel attacks has been shown to be a considerable challenge in practice. This is, in part, due to the most natural countermeasure for such ciphers, namely Boolean masking, not amplifying security well in the absence of sufficient physical noise in the measurements. So-called prime-field masking has been demonstrated to provide improved theoretical guarantees in this context, and the Feistel for Prime Masking (FPM) family of Tweakable Block Ciphers (TBCs) has been recently introduced (Eurocrypt\u201924) to efficiently leverage these advantages. However, it was so far only instantiated for and empirically evaluated in a hardware implementation context, by using a small (7-bit) prime modulus. In this paper, we build on the theoretical incentive to increase the field size to obtain improved side-channel (Eurocrypt\u201924) and fault resistance (CHES\u201924), as well as on the practical incentive to instantiate an FPM instance with optimized performance on 32-bit software platforms. We introduce mid-pSquare for this purpose, a lightweight TBC operating over a 31-bit Mersenne prime field. We first provide an in-depth black box security analysis with a particular focus on algebraic attacks \u2013 which, contrary to the cryptanalysis of instances over smaller primes, are more powerful than statistical ones in our setting. We also design a strong tweak schedule to account for potential related-tweak algebraic attacks which, so far, are almost unknown in the literature. We then demonstrate that mid-pSquare implementations deliver very competitive performance results on the target platform compared to analogous binary TBCs regardless of masked or unmasked implementation (we use fix-sliced SKINNY for our comparisons). Finally, we experimentally establish the side-channel security improvements that masked mid-pSquare can lead to, reaching unmatched resistance to profiled horizontal attacks on lightweight 32-bit processors (ARM Cortex-M4).",

    "abstract": "Side-channel attacks pose significant threats to cryptographic implementations, which require the inclusion of countermeasures to mitigate these attacks. In this work, we study the masking of state-of-the-art post-quantum signatures based on the MPC-in-the-head paradigm. More precisely, we focus on the recent threshold-computation-in-the-head (TCitH) framework that applies to some NIST candidates of the post-quantum standardization process. We first provide an analysis of side-channel attack paths in the signature algorithms based on the TCitH framework. We then explain how to apply standard  masking to achieve a $d$-probing secure implementation of such schemes, with performance scaling in $O(d^{2})$, for $d$ the masking order. \r\n\r\n    Our main contribution is to introduce different ways to tweak those signature schemes towards their masking friendliness. While the TCitH framework comes in two variants, the GGM variant and the Merkle tree variant, we introduce a specific tweak for each of these variants. These tweaks allow us to achieve complexities of $O(d)$ and $O(d \\log d)$ at the cost of non-constant signature size, caused by the inclusion of additional seeds in the signature. We also propose a third tweak that takes advantage of the threshold secret sharing used in TCitH. With the right choice of parameters, we show how, by design, some parts of the TCitH algorithms satisfy probing security without additional countermeasures. While this approach can substantially reduce the cost of masking in some part of the signature algorithm, it degrades the soundness of the core zero-knowledge proof, hence slightly increasing the size of the signature. \r\n\r\n    We analyze the complexity of the masked implementations of our tweaked TCitH signatures and provide benchmarks on a RISC-V platform with built-in hash accelerator. We use a modular benchmarking approach, allowing to estimate the performance of diverse signature instances with different tweaks and parameters. Our results illustrate how the different variants scale for an increasing masking order. For instance, for a masking order $d = 3$, we obtain signatures of around $14$ kB that run in $0.67$ second on a the target RISC-V CPU with a $250$MHz frequency. This is to be compared with the $4.7$ seconds required by the original signature scheme masked at the same order on the same platform. For a masking order $d=7$, we obtain a signature of $17.5$ kB running in $1.75$ second, to be compared with $16$ seconds for the stardard masked signature. \r\n\r\n    Finally, we discuss the extension of our techniques to signature schemes based on the VOLE-in-the-Head framework, which shares similarities with the GGM variant of TCitH. One key takeaway of our work is that the Merkle tree variant of TCitH is inherently more amenable to efficient masking than frameworks based on GGM trees, such as TCitH-GGM or VOLE-in-the-Head.",

    "abstract": "Solitary output secure computation allows a set of mutually distrustful parties to compute a function of their inputs such that only a designated party obtains the output. Such computations should satisfy various security properties such as correctness, privacy, independence of inputs, and even guaranteed output delivery. We are interested in full security, which captures all of these properties. Solitary output secure computation has been the study of many papers in recent years, as it captures many real-world scenarios.\r\n\r\nA systematic study of fully secure solitary output computation was initiated by Halevi et al. [TCC 2019]. They showed several positive and negative results, however, they did not characterize what functions can be computed with full security. Alon et al. [EUROCRYPT 2024] considered the special, yet important case, of three parties with Boolean output, where the output-receiving party has no input. They completely characterized the set of such functionalities that can be computed with full security. Interestingly, they also showed a possible connection with the seemingly unrelated notion of fairness, where either all parties obtain the output or none of them do.\r\n\r\nWe continue this line of investigation and study the set of three-party solitary output Boolean functionalities where all parties hold private inputs. Our main contribution is defining and analyzing a family of ``special-round'' protocols, which generalizes the set of previously proposed protocols. Our techniques allow us to identify which special-round protocols securely compute a given functionality (if such exists). Interestingly, our analysis can also be applied in the two-party setting (where fairness is an issue). Thus, we believe that our techniques may prove useful in additional settings and deepen our understanding of the connections between the various settings.",

    "abstract": "Since the introduction of TLS 1.3, which includes X25519 and X448 as key exchange algorithms, one could expect that high efficient implementations for these two algorithms become important as the need for power efficient and secure IoT devices increases. Assembly optimised X25519 implementations for low end processors such as Cortex-M4 have existed for some time but there has only been scarce progress on optimised X448 implementations for low end ARM processors such as Cortex-M4 and Cortex-M33. This work attempts to fill this gap by demonstrating how to design a constant time X448 implementation that runs in 2 273 479 cycles on Cortex-M4 and 2 170 710 cycles on Cortex-M33 with DSP. An X25519 implementation is also presented that runs in 441 116 cycles on Cortex-M4 and 411 061 cycles on Cortex-M33 with DSP.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a ring referral scheme, by which a user can publicly prove her knowledge of a valid signature for a private message that is signed by one of an ad hoc set of authorized issuers, without revealing the signing issuer. Ring referral is a natural extension to traditional ring signature by allowing a prover to obtain a signature from a third-party signer. Our scheme is useful for diverse applications, such as certificate-hiding decentralized identity, privacy-enhancing federated authentication, anonymous endorsement and privacy -preserving referral marketing. In contrast with prior issuer-hiding credential schemes, our ring referral scheme supports more distinguishing features, such as (1) public verifiability over an ad hoc ring, (2) strong user anonymity against collusion among the issuers and verifier to track a user, (3) transparent setup,  (4) message hiding, (5) efficient multi-message logarithmic verifiability, (6) threshold scheme for requiring multiple co-signing issuers. Finally, we implemented our ring referral scheme with extensive empirical evaluation",

    "abstract": "We introduce deniable secret sharing (DSS), which, analogously to deniable encryption, enables shareholders to produce fake shares that are consistent with a target \u201cfake message\u201d, regardless of the original secret. In contrast to deniable encryption, in a DSS scheme an adversary sees multiple shares, some of which might be real, and some fake. This makes DSS a more difficult task, especially in situations where the fake shares need to be generated by individual shareholders, without coordination with other shareholders.\r\n\r\nWe define several desirable properties for DSS, and show both positive and negative results for each. The strongest property is fake hiding, which is a natural analogy of deniability for encryption: given a complete set of shares, an adversary cannot determine whether any shares are fake. We show a construction based on Shamir secret sharing that achieves fake hiding as long as (1) the fakers are qualified (number $t$ or more), and (2) the set of real shares which the adversary sees is unqualified. Next we show a construction based on indistinguishability obfuscation that relaxes condition (1) and achieves fake hiding even when the fakers are unqualified (as long as they comprise more than half of the shareholders). We also extend the first construction to provide the weaker property of faker anonymity for all thresholds. (Faker anonymity requires that given some real shares and some fake shares, an adversary should not be able to tell which are fake, even if it can tell that some fake shares are present.) All of these constructions require the fakers to coordinate in order to produce fake shares.\r\n\r\nOn the negative side, we first show that fake hiding is unachievable when the fakers are a minority, even if the fakers coordinate. Further, if the fakers do not coordinate, then even faker anonymity is unachievable as soon as $t < n$ (namely the reconstruction threshold is smaller than the number of parties).",

    "abstract": "The integration of AI agents with Web3 ecosystems harnesses their complementary potential for autonomy and openness, yet also introduces underexplored security risks, as these agents dynamically interact with financial protocols and immutable smart contracts. This paper investigates the vulnerabilities of AI agents within blockchain-based financial ecosystems when exposed to adversarial threats in real-world scenarios. We introduce the concept of context manipulation -- a comprehensive attack vector that exploits unprotected context surfaces, including input channels, memory modules, and external data feeds. Through empirical analysis of ElizaOS, a decentralized AI agent framework for automated Web3 operations, we demonstrate how adversaries can manipulate context by injecting malicious instructions into prompts or historical interaction records, leading to unintended asset transfers and protocol violations which could be financially devastating.  Our findings indicate that prompt-based defenses are insufficient, as malicious inputs can corrupt an agent's stored context, creating cascading vulnerabilities across interactions and platforms. This research highlights the urgent need to develop AI agents that are both secure and fiduciarily responsible.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology and smart contracts have revolutionized digital transactions by enabling trustless and decentralized exchanges of value. However, the inherent transparency and immutability of blockchains pose significant privacy challenges. On-chain data, while pseudonymous, is publicly visible and permanently recorded, potentially leading to the inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information. This issue is particularly pronounced in smart contract applications, where contract details are accessible to all network participants, risking the exposure of identities and transactional details.\r\n\r\nTo address these privacy concerns, there is a pressing need for privacy-preserving mechanisms in smart contracts. To showcase this need even further, in our paper we bring forward advanced use-cases in economics which only smart contracts equipped with privacy mechanisms can realize, and show how  fully-homomorphic encryption (FHE) as a privacy enhancing technology (PET) in smart contracts, operating on a public blockchain, can make possible the implementation of these use-cases. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive systematization of FHE-based approaches in smart contracts, examining their potential to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive information while retaining the benefits of smart contracts, such as automation, decentralization, and security. After we evaluate these existing FHE solutions in the context of the use-cases we consider, we  identify open problems, and suggest future research directions to enhance privacy in blockchain smart contracts.",

    "abstract": "Zero-knowledge range arguments are a fundamental cryptographic primitive that allows a prover to convince a verifier of the knowledge of a secret value lying within a predefined range. They have been utilized in diverse applications, such as confidential transactions, proofs of solvency and anonymous credentials. Range arguments with a transparent setup dispense with any trusted setup to eliminate security backdoor and enhance transparency. They are increasingly deployed in diverse decentralized applications on blockchains. One of the major concerns of practical deployment of range arguments on blockchains is the incurred gas cost and high computational overhead associated with blockchain miners. Hence, it is crucial to optimize the verification efficiency in range arguments to alleviate the deployment cost on blockchains and other decentralized platforms. In this paper, we present VeRange with several new zero-knowledge range arguments in the discrete logarithm setting, requiring only $c \\sqrt{N/\\log N}$ group exponentiations for verification, where $N$ is the number of bits to represent a range and $c$ is a small constant, making them concretely efficient for blockchain deployment with a very low gas cost. Furthermore, VeRange is aggregable, allowing a prover to simultaneously prove $T$ range arguments in a single argument, requiring only $O(\\sqrt{TN/\\log (TN)}) + T$ group exponentiations for verification. We deployed {\\tt VeRange} on Ethereum and measured the empirical gas cost, achieving the fastest verification runtime and the lowest gas cost among the discrete-logarithm-based range arguments in practice.",

    "abstract": "Distinguishing Goppa codes or alternant codes from generic\r\nlinear codes [FGO+11] has been shown to be a first step before being\r\nable to attack McEliece cryptosystem based on those codes [BMT24].\r\nWhereas the distinguisher of [FGO+11] is only able to distinguish Goppa\r\ncodes or alternant codes of rate very close to 1, in [CMT23a] a much more\r\npowerful (and more general) distinguisher was proposed. It is based on\r\ncomputing the Hilbert series $\\{\\mathrm{HF}(d),~d\\in  \\mathbb{N}\\}$ of a Pfaffian modeling.\r\nThe distinguisher of [FGO+11] can be interpreted as computing $\\mathrm{HF}(1)$.\r\nComputing $\\mathrm{HF}(2)$ still gives a polynomial time distinguisher for alternant\r\nor Goppa codes and is apparently able to distinguish Goppa or alternant\r\ncodes in a much broader regime of rates as the one of [FGO+11]. However,\r\nthe scope of this distinguisher was unclear. We give here a formula for\r\n$\\mathrm{HF}(2)$ corresponding to generic alternant codes when the field size $q$\r\nsatisfies $q \\geq r$, where r is the degree of the alternant code. We also\r\nshow that this expression for$\\mathrm{HF}(2)$ provides a lower bound in general.\r\nThe value of $\\mathrm{HF}(2)$ corresponding to random linear codes is known and\r\nthis yields a precise description of the new regime of rates that can be\r\ndistinguished by this new method. This shows that the new distinguisher\r\nimproves significantly upon the one given in [FGO+11].",

    "abstract": "Systems such as file backup services often use content-defined chunking (CDC) algorithms, especially those based on rolling hash techniques, to split files into chunks in a way that allows for data deduplication. These chunking algorithms often depend on per-user parameters in an attempt to avoid leaking information about the data being stored. We present attacks to extract these chunking parameters and discuss protocol-agnostic attacks and loss of security once the parameters are breached (including when these parameters are not setup at all, which is often available as an option). Our parameter-extraction attacks themselves are protocol-specific but their ideas are generalizable to many potential CDC schemes.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Vector Oblivious Linear Evaluation (VOLE) protocols have enabled constant-round, fast, and scalable (designated-verifier) zero-knowledge proofs, significantly reducing prover computational cost. Existing protocols, such as QuickSilver [CCS\u201921] and LPZKv2 [CCS\u201922], achieve efficiency with prover costs of 4 multiplications in the extension field per AND gate for Boolean circuits, with one multiplication requiring a O(\u03ba log \u03ba)-bit operation where \u03ba = 128 is the security parameter and 3-4 field multiplications per multiplication gate for arithmetic circuits over a large field.\r\nWe introduce JesseQ, a suite of two VOLE-based protocols: JQv1 and JQv2, which advance state of the art. JQv1 requires only 2 scalar multiplications in an extension field per AND gate for Boolean circuits, with one scalar needing a O(\u03ba)- bit operation, and 2 field multiplications per multiplication gate for arithmetic circuits over a large field. In terms of communication costs, JQv1 needs just 1 field element per gate. JQv2 further reduces communication costs by half at the cost of doubling the prover\u2019s computation.\r\nExperiments show that, compared to the current state of the art, both JQv1 and JQv2 achieve at least 3.9\u00d7 improvement for Boolean circuits. For large field circuits, JQv1 has a similar performance, while JQv2 offers a 1.3\u00d7 improvement. Additionally, both JQv1 and JQv2 maintain the same communication cost as the current state of the art. Notably, on the cheapest AWS instances, JQv1 can prove 9.2 trillion AND gates (or 5.8 trillion multiplication gates over a 61-bit field) for just one US dollar. JesseQ excels in applications like inner products, matrix multiplication, and lattice problems, delivering 40%- 200% performance improvements compared to QuickSilver. Additionally, JesseQ integrates seamlessly with the sublinear Batchman framework [CCS\u201923], enabling further efficiency gains for batched disjunctive statements.",

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly embedded in high-stakes applications such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, ensuring the verifiability of AI computations without compromising sensitive data or proprietary models is crucial. Zero-knowledge machine learning (ZKML) leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enable the verification of AI model outputs while preserving confidentiality. However, existing ZKML approaches require specialized cryptographic expertise, making them inaccessible to traditional AI developers.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce ZKPyTorch, a compiler that seamlessly integrates ML frameworks like PyTorch with ZKP engines like Expander, simplifying the development of ZKML. ZKPyTorch automates the translation of ML operations into optimized ZKP circuits through three key components. First, a ZKP preprocessor converts models into structured computational graphs and injects necessary auxiliary information to facilitate proof generation. Second, a ZKP-friendly quantization module introduces an optimized quantization strategy that reduces computation bit-widths, enabling efficient ZKP execution within smaller finite fields such as M61. Third, a hierarchical ZKP circuit optimizer employs a multi-level optimization framework at model, operation, and circuit levels to improve proof generation efficiency.\r\n\r\nWe demonstrate ZKPyTorch effectiveness through end-to-end case studies, successfully converting VGG-16 and Llama-3 models from PyTorch, a leading ML framework, into ZKP-compatible circuits recognizable by Expander, a state-of-the-art ZKP engine. Using Expander, we generate zero-knowledge proofs for\r\nthese models, achieving proof generation for the VGG-16 model in 2.2 seconds per CIFAR-10 image for VGG-16 and 150 seconds per token for Llama-3 inference, improving the practical adoption of ZKML.",

    "abstract": "The Fiat-Shamir transformation underlies numerous non-interactive arguments, with variants that differ in important ways. This paper addresses a gap between variants analyzed by theoreticians and variants implemented (and deployed) by practitioners. Specifically, theoretical analyses typically assume parties have access to random oracles with sufficiently large input and output size, while cryptographic hash functions in practice have fixed input and output sizes (pushing practitioners towards other variants).\r\n\r\nIn this paper we propose and analyze a variant of the Fiat-Shamir transformation that is based on an ideal permutation of fixed size. The transformation relies on the popular duplex sponge paradigm, and minimizes the number of calls to the permutation (given the amount of information to absorb and to squeeze). Our variant closely models deployed variants of the Fiat-Shamir transformation, and our analysis provides concrete security bounds that can be used to set security parameters in practice.\r\n\r\nWe additionally contribute spongefish, an open-source Rust library implementing our Fiat-Shamir transformation. The library is interoperable across multiple cryptographic frameworks, and works with any choice of permutation. The library comes equipped with Keccak and Poseidon permutations, as well as several \"codecs\" for re-mapping prover and verifier messages to the permutation's domain.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the intersection of deep learning and differential cryptanalysis has given rise to the emerging field of differential neural cryptanalysis, providing an efficient data-driven paradigm for security evaluation of modern cryptographic algorithms. Traditional differential cryptanalysis relies on manual search for high-probability differential characteristics, a process limited by the nonlinearity complexity of the algorithm.  In contrast, differential neural cryptanalysis improves the efficiency and automation of the analysis by training neural networks to automatically extract statistical features from ciphertext pairs. As research advances, Lu et al. proposed improved related-key neural distinguishers for the SIMON and SIMECK algorithms. However, current methodologies for constructing related-key distinguishers remain highly specialized, lacking a generalized optimization framework to address diverse cryptographic structures.\r\n\r\nThis paper proposes a novel framework for constructing related-key neural differential distinguishers that optimizes three key components: dataset construction (multi-ciphertext multi-difference formats), differential path selection (structural filtering), and network architecture (DRSN for noise suppression). By applying this framework to two standardized algorithms, DES and PRESENT, our experiments demonstrate significant advancements. For DES, the framework achieves an 8-round related-key neural distinguisher and improves 6/7-round distinguisher accuracy by over 40%. For PRESENT, we construct the first 9-round related-key neural distinguisher, which outperforms existing single-key distinguishers in both round coverage and accuracy. Additionally, we employ kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and K-means clustering to evaluate the quality of differential datasets for DES and PRESENT, revealing that clustering compactness strongly correlates with distinguisher performance. Furthermore, we propose a validation algorithm to verify differential combinations with cryptographic advantages from a machine learning perspective, identifying 'good' plaintext-key differential combinations. We apply this approach to the SIMECK algorithm, demonstrating its broad applicability. These findings validate the framework\u2019s effectiveness in bridging cryptographic analysis with data-driven feature extraction and offer new insights for automated security evaluation of block ciphers.",

    "abstract": "Digital signatures underpin identity, authenticity, and trust in modern computer systems. Cryptography research has shown that it is possible to prove possession of a valid message and signature for some public key, without revealing the message or signature. These proofs of possession work only for specially-designed signature schemes. Though these proofs of possession have many useful applications to improving security, privacy, and anonymity, they are not currently usable for widely deployed, legacy signature schemes such as RSA, ECDSA, and Ed25519. Unlocking practical proofs of possession for these legacy signature schemes requires closing a huge efficiency gap.\r\n\r\nThis work brings proofs of possession for legacy signature schemes very close to practicality. Our design strategy is to encode the signature's verification algorithm as a rank-one constraint system (R1CS), then use a zkSNARK to prove knowledge of a solution. To do this efficiently we (1) design and analyze a new zkSNARK called Dorian that supports randomized computations, (2) introduce several new techniques for encoding hashes, elliptic curve operations, and modular arithmetic,  (3) give a new approach that allows performing the most expensive parts of ECDSA and Ed25519 verifications outside R1CS, and (4) generate a novel elliptic curve that allows expressing Ed25519 curve operations very efficiently. Our techniques reduce R1CS sizes by up to 200$\\times$ and prover times by 3-22$\\times$. \r\n\r\nWe can generate a 240-byte proof of possession of an RSA signature over a message the size of a typical TLS certificate (two kilobytes) in only three seconds.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain advancements, currency digitalization, and declining cash usage have fueled global interest in Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). The BIS states that the hybrid model, where central banks authorize intermediaries to manage distribution, is more suitable than the direct model. However, designing a CBDC for practical implementation requires careful consideration. First, the public blockchain raises privacy concerns due to transparency. While zk-SNARKs can be a solution, they can introduce significant proof generation overhead for large-scale transactions. Second, intermediaries that provide user-facing services on behalf of the central bank commonly performs Proof of Liabilities on customers' static liabilities. However, in real-world scenarios where user liabilities can arbitrarily increase or decrease, the static nature poses such as window attacks. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose a new smart contract-based privacy-preserving CBDC framework based on zk-SNARKs, called $\\textbf{Aegis}$. our framework introduces a transaction batching technique to enhance scalability and  defines a new dynamic PoL which is near-real time. We formally define the security models for our system and provide rigorous security proofs to demonstrate its robustness. To evaluate the system\u2019s performance, we instantiate our proposed framework and measure its efficiency. The result indicates that, the end-to-end process, including proof generation for 512 transactions, takes approximately 2.8 seconds, with a gas consumption of 74,726 per user.",

    "abstract": "Power side-channel (PSC) vulnerabilities present formidable challenges to the security of ubiquitous microelectronic devices in mission-critical infrastructure. Existing side-channel assessment techniques mostly focus on post-silicon stages by analyzing power profiles of fabricated devices, suffering from low flexibility and prohibitively high cost while deploying security countermeasures. While pre-silicon PSC assessments offer flexibility and low cost, the true nature of the power signatures cannot be fully captured through RTL or gate-level design. Although physical design-level analysis provides precise power traces, collecting data is time and resource-consuming at the layout level. To address this challenge, we propose, for the first time, a fast and efficient physical design-level PSC assessment framework using a graph neural network (GNN). This framework predicts dynamic power traces for new layouts, using them to assess physical design security through metrics evaluation. Our experiments on AES-GF layout implementations achieve a tremendous 133 times speedup compared to conventional simulation-based flow without sacrificing substantial accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Over two decades since their introduction in 2005, all major verifiable pairing delegation protocols for public inputs have been designed to ensure information-theoretic security. However, we note that a delegation protocol involving only ephemeral secret keys in the public view can achieve everlasting security, provided the server is unable to produce a pairing forgery within the protocol\u2019s execution time. Thus, computationally bounding the adversary\u2019s capabilities during the protocol\u2019s execution, rather than across its entire lifespan, may be more reasonable, especially when the goal is to achieve significant efficiency gains for the delegating party. This consideration is particularly relevant given the continuously evolving computational costs associated with pairing computations and their ancillary blocks, which creates an ever-changing landscape for what constitutes efficiency in pairing delegation protocols. \r\nWith the goal of fulfilling both efficiency and everlasting security, we present AmorE, a protocol equipped with an adjustable security and efficiency parameter for sequential pairing delegation, which achieves state-of-the-art amortized efficiency in terms of the number of pairing computations. For example, delegating batches of 10 pairings on the BLS48-575 elliptic curve via our protocol costs to the client, on average, less than a single scalar multiplication in G2 per delegated pairing, while still ensuring at least 40 bits of statistical security.",

    "abstract": "In order to compute a multiple of a point on an elliptic curve in Weierstrass form one can use formulas in only one of the two coordinates of the points. These $x$-only formulas can be seen as an arithmetic on the Kummer line associated to the curve.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we look at models of Kummer lines, and define an intrinsic notion of isomorphisms of Kummer lines. This allows us to give conversion formulas between Kummer models in a unified manner. When there is one rational point $T$ of $2$-torsion on the curve, we also use Mumford's theory of theta groups to show that there are two type of models: the \u201csymmetric\u201d ones with respect to $T$ and the \u201canti-symmetric\u201c ones. We show how this recovers the Montgomery model and various variants of the theta model.\r\n\r\nWe also classify when curves admit these different models via Galois representations and modular curves. When an elliptic curve is viewed inside a $2$-isogeny volcano, we give a criteria to say if it has a given Kummer model based solely on its position in the volcano.  We also give applications to the ECM factorization algorithm.",

    "abstract": "The current landscape of system-on-chips (SoCs) security verification faces challenges due to manual, labor-intensive, and inflexible methodologies. These issues limit the scalability and effectiveness of security protocols, making bug detection at the Register-Transfer Level (RTL) difficult. This paper proposes a new framework named BugWhisperer that utilizes a specialized, fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) to address these challenges. By enhancing the LLM's hardware security knowledge and leveraging its capabilities for text inference and knowledge transfer, this approach automates and improves the adaptability and reusability of the verification process. We introduce an open-source, fine-tuned LLM specifically designed for detecting security vulnerabilities in SoC designs. Our findings demonstrate that this tailored LLM effectively enhances the efficiency and flexibility of the security verification process. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive hardware vulnerability database that supports this work and will further assist the research community in enhancing the security verification process.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a security analysis of the South Korean Format-Preserving Encryption (FPE) standards FEA-1 and FEA-2. In 2023, Chauhan \\textit{et al.} presented the first third-party analysis of FEA-1 and FEA-2 against the square attack. The authors proposed new distinguishing attacks covering up to three rounds of FEA-1 and five rounds of FEA-2, with a data complexity of $2^8$ plaintexts. Additionally, using these distinguishers, they presented key recovery attacks for four rounds of FEA-1 and six rounds of FEA-2, for 192-bit and 256-bit key sizes. The complexities of both the four-round FEA-1 and six-round FEA-2 key recovery attacks are $2^{137.6}$. \\\\\r\n\r\nIn this work, we successfully extend the number of rounds attacked for both FEA-1 and FEA-2, using the square attack technique. Specifically, we present a four-round distinguishing attack against FEA-1 and six-round distinguishing attack against FEA-2. The data complexities of these distinguishers are $2^{64}$ plaintexts. Furthermore, we apply these distinguishers to perform key recovery attacks on five rounds of FEA-1 and seven rounds of FEA-2, targeting the 256-bit key size. The time complexities of the presented key recovery attacks are $2^{193.6}$.",

    "abstract": "HuFu is an unstructured lattice-based signature scheme proposed during the NIST PQC standardization process. In this work, we present a side-channel analysis of HuFu's reference implementation.\r\n\r\nWe first exploit the multiplications involving its two main secret matrices, recovering approximately half of their entries through a non-profiled power analysis with a few hundred traces. Using these coefficients, we reduce the dimension of the underlying LWE problem, enabling full secret key recovery with calls to a small block-sized BKZ.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this attack, we propose a countermeasure that replaces sensitive computations involving a secret matrix with equivalent operations derived solely from public elements, eliminating approximately half of the identified leakage and rendering the attack unfeasible.\r\n\r\nFinally, we perform a non-profiled power analysis targeting HuFu's Gaussian sampling procedure, recovering around 75\\% of the remaining secret matrix's entries in a few hundred traces. While full key recovery remains computationally intensive, we demonstrate that partial knowledge of the secret significantly improves the efficiency of signature forgery.",

    "abstract": "Digital identity wallets allow citizens to prove who they are and manage digital documents, called credentials, such as mobile driving licenses or passports. As with physical documents, secure and privacy-preserving management of the credential lifecycle is crucial: a credential can change its status from issued to valid, revoked or expired. In this paper, we focus on the analysis of cryptographic accumulators as a revocation scheme for digital identity wallet credentials. We describe the most well-established public key accumulators, and how zero-knowledge proofs can be used with accumulators for revocation of non-anonymous credentials. In addition, we assess the computational and communication costs analytically and experimentally. Our results show that they are comparable with existing schemes used in the context of certificate revocation.",

    "abstract": "This work presents an exact and compact formula for the probability of rotation-xor differentials (RX-differentials) through modular addition, for arbitrary rotation amounts, which has been a long-standing open problem. The formula comes with a rigorous proof and is also verified by extensive experiments.\r\n\r\nOur formula uncovers error in a recent work from 2022 proposing a formula for rotation amounts bigger than 1. Surprisingly, it also affects correctness of the more studied and used formula for the rotation amount equal to 1 (from TOSC 2016). Specifically, it uncovers rare cases where the assumptions of this formula do not hold. Correct formula for arbitrary rotations now opens up a larger search space where one can often find better trails.\r\n\r\nFor applications, we propose automated mixed integer linear programming (MILP) modeling techniques for searching optimal RX-trails based on our exact formula. They are consequently applied to several ARX designs, including Salsa, Alzette and a small-key variant of Speck, and yield many new RX-differential distinguishers, some of them based on provably optimal trails. In order to showcase the relevance of the RX-differential analysis, we also design Malzette, a 12-round Alzette-based permutation with maliciously chosen constants, which has a practical RX-differential distinguisher, while standard differential/linear security arguments suggest sufficient security.",

    "abstract": "In a social key recovery scheme, users back up their secret keys (typically using Shamir's secret sharing) with their social connections, known as a set of guardians. This places a heavy burden on the guardians, as they must manage their shares both securely and reliably. Finding and managing such a set of guardians may not be easy, especially when the consequences of losing a key are significant. \r\n\r\nWe take an alternative approach of social recovery within a community, where each member already holds a secret key (with possibly an associated public key) and uses other community members as their guardians forming a mutual dependency among themselves. Potentially, each member acts as a guardian for upto $(n-1)$ other community members.  Therefore, in this setting, using standard Shamir's sharing leads to a linear ($O(n)$) blow-up in the internal secret storage of the guardian for each key recovery. Our solution avoids this linear blowup in internal secret storage by relying on a novel secret-sharing scheme, leveraging the fact that each member already manages a secret key. In fact, our scheme does not require guardians to store anything beyond their own secret keys. \r\n\r\nWe propose the first formal definition of a social key recovery scheme for general access structures in the community setting. We prove that our scheme is secure against any malicious and adaptive adversary that may corrupt up to $t$ parties. As a main technical tool, we use a new notion of secret sharing, that enables $(t+1)$ out of $n$ sharing of a secret even when the shares are generated independently -- we formalize this as bottom-up secret sharing (BUSS), which may be of independent interest. \r\n\r\nFinally, we provide an implementation benchmarking varying the number of guardians both in a regional, and geo-distributed setting. For instance, for 8 guardians, our backup protocol takes around 146-149 ms in a geo-distributed WAN setting, and 4.9-5.9 ms in the LAN setting; for recovery protocol, the timings are approximately the same for the WAN setting (as network latency dominates), and 1.2-1.4 ms for the LAN setting.",

    "abstract": "A (single server) private information retrieval (PIR) allows a client to read data from a public database held on a remote server, without revealing to the server which locations she is reading. In a doubly efficient PIR (DEPIR), the database is first preprocessed offline into a data structure, which then allows the server to answer any client query efficiently in sub-linear  online time. Constructing DEPIR is a notoriously difficult problem, and this difficulty even extends to a weaker notion secret-key DEPIR (SK-DEPIR), where the database is preprocessed using secret randomness and the client is given a secret key for making queries.  We currently only have constructions of SK-DEPIR from the Ring LWE assumption or from non-standard code-based assumptions. \r\n\r\n We show that the black-box use of essentially all generic cryptographic primitives (e.g., key agreement, oblivious transfer, indistinguishability obfuscation, etc.), including idealized primitives (e.g., random oracles, generic multilinear groups, virtual black-box obfuscation, etc.) is essentially useless for constructing SK-DEPIR. In particular, in any such SK-DEPIR construction, we can replace all black-box use of these primitives with just a black-box use of one-way functions. While we conjecture that SK-DEPIR cannot be constructed using black-box one-way functions alone, we are unable to show this in its full generality. However, we do show this for 2-round schemes with a passive server that simply outputs requested locations in the preprocessed data structure, which is the format of all known schemes. Overall, this shows that the black-box use of essentially all crypto primitives is insufficient for constructing 2-round passive-server SK-DEPIR, and does not provide any benefit beyond black-box one-way functions for constructing general SK-DEPIR.",

    "abstract": "Hardware IP blocks have been subjected to various forms of confidentiality and integrity attacks in recent years due to the globalization of the semiconductor industry. System-on-chip (SoC) designers are now considering a zero-trust model for security, where an IP can be attacked at any stage of the manufacturing process for piracy, cloning, overproduction, or malicious alterations. Hardware redaction has emerged as a promising countermeasure to thwart confidentiality and integrity attacks by untrusted entities in the globally distributed supply chain. However, existing redaction techniques provide this security at high overhead costs, making them unsuitable for real-world implementation. In this paper, we propose HIPR, a fine-grain redaction methodology that is robust, scalable, and incurs significantly lower overhead compared to existing redaction techniques. HIPR redacts security-critical Boolean and sequential logic from the hardware design, performs interconnect randomization, and employs multiple overhead optimization steps to reduce overhead costs. We evaluate HIPR on open-source benchmarks and reduce area overheads by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art redaction techniques without compromising security. We also demonstrate that the redaction performed by HIPR is resilient against conventional functional and structural attacks on hardware IPs. The redacted test IPs used to evaluate HIPR are available at: https://github.com/UF-Nelms-IoT-Git-Projects/HIPR.",

    "abstract": "We analyze the composition of symmetric encryption and digital signatures in secure group messaging protocols where group members share a symmetric encryption key. In particular, we analyze the chat encryption algorithms underlying MLS, Session, Signal, and Matrix using the formalism of symmetric signcryption introduced by Jaeger, Kumar, and Stepanovs (Eurocrypt 2024). We identify theoretical attacks against each of the constructions we analyze that result from the insufficient binding between the symmetric encryption scheme and the digital signature scheme. In the case of MLS and Session, these translate into practically exploitable replay and reordering attacks by a group-insider. For Signal this leads to a forgery attack by a group-outsider with access to a user\u2019s signing key, an attack previously discovered by Balb\u00e1s, Collins, and Gajland (Asiacrypt 2023). In Matrix there are mitigations in the broader ecosystem that prevent exploitation. We provide formal security theorems that each of the four constructions are secure up to these attacks. Additionally, in Session we identified two attacks outside the symmetric signcryption model. The first allows a group-outsider with access to an exposed signing key to forge arbitrary messages and the second allows outsiders to replay ciphertexts.",

    "abstract": "In order for a client to securely connect to a server on the web, the client must trust certificate authorities (CAs) only to issue certificates to the legitimate operator of the server. If a certificate is miss-issued, it is possible for an attacker to impersonate the server to the client. The goal of Certificate Transparency (CT) is to log every certificate issued in a manner that allows anyone to audit the logs for miss-issuance. A client can even audit a CT log itself, but this would leak sensitive browsing data to the log operator. As a result, client-side audits are rare in practice. \r\nIn this work, we revisit private CT auditing from a real-world perspective. Our study is motivated by recent changes to the CT ecosystem and advancements in Private Information Retrieval (PIR). First, we find that checking for inclusion of Signed Certificate Timestamps (SCTs) in a log \u2014 the audit performed by clients \u2014 is now possible with PIR in under a second and under 100kb of communication with minor adjustments to the protocol that have been proposed previously. Our results also show how to scale audits by using existing batching techniques and the algebraic structure of the PIR protocols, in particular to obtain certificate hashes by included in the log.\r\nSince PIR protocols are more performant with smaller databases, we also suggest a number of strategies to lower the size of the SCT database for audits. Our key observation is that the web will likely transition to a new model for certificate issuance. While this transition is primarily motivated by the need to adapt the PKI to larger, post-quantum signature schemes, it also removes the need for SCT audits in most cases. We present the first estimates of how this transition may impact SCT auditing, based on data gathered from public CT logs. We find that large scale deployment of the new issuance model may reduce the number of SCT audits needed by a factor of 1,000, making PIR-based auditing practical to deploy.",

    "abstract": "Distributed SNARKs enable multiple provers to collaboratively generate proofs, enhancing the efficiency and scalability of large-scale computations. The state-of-the-art distributed SNARK for Plonk, Pianist (S\\&P '24), achieves constant proof size, constant amortized communication complexity, and constant verifier complexity. However, when proving the Rank-One Constraint System (R1CS), a widely used intermediate representation for SNARKs, Pianist must perform the transformation from R1CS into Plonk before proving, which can introduce a start-up cost of $10\\times$ due to the expansion of the statement size. Meanwhile, existing distributed SNARKs for R1CS, e.g., DIZK (USENIX Sec. '18) and Hekaton (CCS '24), fail to match the superior asymptotic complexities of Pianist.\r\n\r\nWe propose $\\textsf{Soloist}$, an optimized distributed SNARK for R1CS. $\\textsf{Soloist}$ achieves constant proof size, constant amortized communication complexity, and constant verifier complexity, relative to the R1CS size $n$. Utilized with $\\ell$ sub-provers, its prover complexity is $O(n/\\ell \\cdot \\log(n/\\ell))$. The concrete prover time is~$\\ell\\times$ as fast as the R1CS-targeted Marlin (Eurocrypt '20). For zkRollups, $\\textsf{Soloist}$ can prove more transactions, with $2.5 \\times$ smaller memory costs, $2.8\\times$ faster preprocessing, and $1.8\\times$ faster proving than Pianist.\r\n\r\n$\\textsf{Soloist}$ leverages an improved inner product argument and a new batch bivariate polynomial commitment variant of KZG (Asiacrypt '10). To achieve constant verification, we propose a new preprocessing method with a lookup argument for unprescribed tables, which are usually assumed pre-committed in prior works. Notably, all these schemes are equipped with scalable distributed mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Content-defined chunking (CDC) algorithms split streams of data into smaller blocks, called chunks, in a way that preserves chunk boundaries when the data is partially changed. CDC is ubiquitous in applications that deduplicate data such as backup solutions, software patching systems, and file hosting platforms. Much like compression, CDC can introduce leakage when combined with encryption: fingerprinting attacks can exploit chunk length patterns to infer information about the data.\r\nTo address these risks, many systems\u2014mainly in the cloud backup setting\u2014have developed bespoke mitigations by mixing a cryptographic key into the chunking process. We study these keyed CDC (KCDC) schemes \u201cin the wild\u201d, presenting efficient key recovery attacks against five different KCDC schemes, deployed in the backup solutions Borg, Bupstash, Duplicacy, Restic, and Tarsnap. Our attacks are in a realistic threat model that relies only on weak known or chosen-plaintext capabilities. This shows, in particular, that they fail to protect against fingerprinting attacks. To demonstrate practical exploitability, we also present \u201cend-to-end\u201d attacks on three complete encrypted backup applications, namely Borg, Restic and Tarsnap. These build on our attacks on the underlying KCDC schemes.\r\nIn an effort to tackle these problems, we introduce the first formal treatment for KCDC schemes and propose a provably secure construction that fulfills a strong notion of security. We benchmark our construction against existing (broken) approaches, showing that it has competitive performance. In doing so, we take a step towards making real-world systems that rely on KCDC more resilient to attacks.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a side-channel attack on the hardware AES accelerator of a Bluetooth chip used in millions of devices worldwide, ranging from wearables and smart home products to industrial IoT. The attack leverages information about AES computations unintentionally transmitted by the chip together with RF signals to recover the encryption key. Unlike traditional side-channel attacks that rely on power or near-field electromagnetic emissions as sources of information, RF-based attacks leave no evidence of tampering, as they do not require package removal, chip decapsulation, or additional soldered components. However, side-channel emissions extracted from RF signals are considerably weaker and noisier, necessitating more traces for key recovery. The presented profiled machine learning-assisted attack can recover the full encryption key from 90,000 traces captured at a one-meter distance from the target device, with each trace being an average of 10,000 samples per encryption. This is a twofold improvement over the correlation analysis-based attack on the same AES accelerator.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based side-channel analysis has become a popular and powerful option for side-channel attacks in recent years. One of the main directions that the side-channel community explores is how to design efficient architectures that can break the targets with as little as possible attack traces, but also how to consistently build such architectures.\r\nIn this work, we explore the usage of the JumpReLU activation function, which was designed to improve the robustness of neural networks. Intuitively speaking, improving the robustness seems a natural requirement for side-channel analysis, as hiding countermeasures could be considered adversarial attacks. \r\nIn our experiments, we explore three strategies: 1) exchanging the activation functions with JumpReLU at the inference phase, training common side-channel architectures with JumpReLU, and 3) conducting hyperparameter search with JumpReLU as the activation function. While the first two options do not yield improvements in results (but also do not show worse performance), the third option brings advantages, especially considering the number of neural networks that break the target. As such, we conclude that using JumpReLU is a good option to improve the stability of attack results.",

    "abstract": "Current hardware security verification processes predominantly rely on manual threat modeling and test plan generation, which are labor-intensive, error-prone, and struggle to scale with increasing design complexity and evolving attack methodologies. To address these challenges, we propose ThreatLens, an LLM-driven multi-agent framework that automates security threat modeling and test plan generation for hardware security verification. ThreatLens integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to extract relevant security knowledge, LLM-powered reasoning for threat assessment, and interactive user feedback to ensure the generation of practical test plans. By automating these processes, the framework reduces the manual verification effort, enhances coverage, and ensures a structured, adaptable approach to security verification. We evaluated our framework on the NEORV32 SoC, demonstrating its capability to automate security verification through structured test plans and validating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Since the selection of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization algorithms, research on integrating PQC into security protocols such as TLS/SSL, IPSec, and DNSSEC has been actively pursued. However, PQC migration for Internet of Things (IoT) communication protocols remains largely unexplored. Embedded devices in IoT environments have limited computational power and memory, making it crucial to optimize PQC algorithms for efficient computation and minimal memory usage when deploying them on low-spec IoT devices. In this paper, we introduce KEM-MQTT, a lightweight and efficient Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) for the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, widely used in IoT environments. Our approach applies the NIST KEM algorithm Crystals-Kyber (Kyber) while leveraging MQTT\u2019s characteristics and sensor node constraints. To enhance efficiency, we address certificate verification issues and adopt KEMTLS to eliminate the need for Post-Quantum Digital Signatures Algorithm (PQC-DSA) in mutual authentication. As a result, KEM-MQTT retains its lightweight properties while maintaining the security guarantees of TLS 1.3. We identify inefficiencies in existing Kyber implementations on 8-bit AVR microcontrollers (MCUs), which are highly resource-constrained. To address this, we propose novel implementation techniques that optimize Kyber for AVR, focusing on high-speed execution, reduced memory consumption, and secure implementation, including Signed LookUp-Table (LUT) Reduction. Our optimized Kyber achieves performance gains of 81%,75%, and 85% in the KeyGen, Encaps, and DeCaps processes, respectively, compared to the reference implementation. With approximately 3 KB of stack usage, our Kyber implementation surpasses all state-of-the-art Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) implementations. Finally, in KEM-MQTT using Kyber-512, an 8-bit AVR device completes the handshake preparation process in 4.32 seconds, excluding the physical transmission and reception times.",

    "abstract": "Both masking and shuffling are very common software countermeasures against side-channel attacks. However, exploring possible combinations of the two countermeasures to increase and fine-tune side-channel resilience is less investigated. With this work, we aim to bridge that gap by both concretising the security guarantees of several masking and shuffling combinations presented in earlier work and additionally investigating their randomness cost. We subsequently implement these approaches to also analyse their performance. In this context, we present five different protected implementations of the new standard for lightweight cryptography, Ascon, on a 32-bit RISC-V architecture: A 3rd-order masked, unshuffled implementation and three combined 3rd-order masked and shuffled implementations. Additionally, we present a levelled implementation where only the particularly vulnerable keyed initialisation and finalisation of the permutation are masked and shuffled, while the rest is only shuffled. To further improve the security and performance of our implementations we make use of the Probe Isolating Non-Interference (PINI) masked AND gadget, coupled with techniques like bit-slicing and bit-interleaving. Utilising benchmarking and an MI-shortcut security analysis, we pinpoint the best masking-shuffling combinations that maximize security at reasonable overheads.",

    "abstract": "Fruit-F is a lightweight short-state stream cipher designed by Ghafari et al. The authors designed this version of the cipher, after earlier versions of the cipher viz. Fruit 80/v2 succumbed to correlation attacks. The primary motivation behind this design seemed to be preventing correlation attacks. Fruit-F has a Grain-like structure with two state registers of size 50 bits each. In addition, the cipher uses an 80-bit secret key and an 80-bit IV. The authors use a complex key-derivation function to update the non-linear register which prevents the same key-bit alignment across fixed-length window of keystream bits, which is essentially what stops the correlation attacks.  \r\nIn this paper, we first present two attacks against Fruit-F. The first attack stems from the fact that the key-derivation can be rewritten as the Boolean xor of two key-dependent terms one of which is the Boolean OR of two bits of the key. Using this we show that the cipher does not offer 80-bit security: the effective key space of Fruit-F is slightly less than $2^{80}$, i.e. a simple brute force attack costs around $2^{80}-2^{49}$ time. The second is a differential attack using the cipher's complex initialization process. We show that under some given conditions, it is possible to have two initial vectors $V_1$ and $V_2$ that produce identical keystream vectors with any given key. Using this as a distinguisher, it is possible to collect enough linear and quadratic equations of the secret key to find it in practical time with very few keystream bits.",

    "abstract": "Current DAG-based BFT protocols face a critical trade-off: certified DAGs provide strong security guarantees but require additional rounds of communication to progress the DAG construction, while uncertified DAGs achieve lower latency at the cost of either reduced resistance to adversarial behaviour or higher communication costs.\r\n\r\nThis paper presents Starfish, a partially synchronous DAG-based BFT protocol that achieves the security properties of certified DAGs, the efficiency of uncertified approaches and linear amortized communication complexity. The key innovation is Encoded Cordial Dissemination, a push-based dissemination strategy that combines Reed-Solomon erasure coding with Data Availability Certificates (DACs). Each of the $n=3f+1$ validators disseminates complete transaction data for its own blocks while distributing encoded shards for others' blocks, enabling efficient data reconstruction with just $f+1$ shards. Building on the previous uncertified DAG BFT commit rule, Starfish extends it to efficiently verify data availability through committed leader blocks serving as DACs.  For large enough transaction data, this design allows Starfish to achieve $O(n)$ amortized communication complexity per committed transaction byte. The average and worst-case end-to-end latencies for Starfish are rigorously proven to be bounded by $7.5\\delta$ and $11\\delta$ in the steady state, where $\\delta$ denotes the actual network delay.\r\n\r\nExperimental evaluation against state-of-the-art DAG BFT protocols demonstrates Starfish's robust performance under steady-state and Byzantine scenarios. \r\nOur results show that strong Byzantine fault tolerance, high performance, and low communication complexity can coexist in DAG BFT protocols, making Starfish particularly suitable for large-scale distributed ledger deployments.",

    "abstract": "The Nintendo DSi is a handheld gaming console released by Nintendo in 2008. In Nintendo's line-up the DSi served as a successor to the DS and was later succeeded by the 3DS. The security systems of both the DS and 3DS have been fully analysed and defeated. However, for over 14 years the security systems of the Nintendo DSi remained standing and had not been fully analysed. To that end this work builds on existing research and demonstrates the use of a second-order fault injection attack to extract the ROM bootloaders stored in the custom system-on-chip used by the DSi. We analyse the effect of the induced fault and compare it to theoretical fault models. Additionally, we present a security analysis of the extracted ROM bootloaders and develop a modchip using cheap off-the-shelf components. The modchip allows to jailbreak the console, but more importantly allows to resurrect consoles previously assumed irreparable.",

    "abstract": "Issuing tokens on Bitcoin remains a highly sought-after goal, driven by its market dominance and robust security. However, Bitcoin's limited on-chain storage and functionality pose significant challenges. Among the various approaches to token issuance on Bitcoin, client-side validation (CSV) has emerged as a prominent solution. CSV delegates data storage and functionalities beyond Bitcoin\u2019s native capabilities to off-chain clients, while leveraging the blockchain to validate tokens and prevent double-spending. Nevertheless, these protocols require participants to maintain token ownership and transactional data, rendering them vulnerable to data loss and malicious data withholding. In this paper, we propose UTxO binding, a novel framework that achieves both robust data availability and enhanced functionality compared to existing CSV designs. This approach securely binds a Bitcoin UTxO, which prevents double-spending, to a UTxO on an auxiliary blockchain, providing data storage and programmability. We formally prove its security and implement our design using Nervos CKB as the auxiliary blockchain.",

    "abstract": "Embedded devices can be exposed to a wide range of attacks. Some classes of attacks can be mitigated using security features or dedicated countermeasures. Examples include Trusted Execution Environments, and masking countermeasures against physical side-channel attacks. However, a system that incorporates such secure components is not automatically a secure system. Partial Key Overwrite attacks are one class of attacks that specifically target the interface between different components of the security system. These attacks may allow an adversary to extract otherwise protected cryptographic keys through careful manipulation of memory-mapped registers. So far this powerful class of attacks has received little attention in the academic literature. In this work, we provide an overview of known Partial Key Overwrite vulnerabilities and how they were used in real-world attacks. Additionally, we evaluated 31 common microcontrollers and embedded microprocessors from eleven distinct vendors and detail our findings. Based on a first high-level evaluation we selected 15 SoCs and performed an in-depth evaluation. This evaluation revealed that at least eight of these SoCs are vulnerable to partial key overwrite attacks.",

    "abstract": "Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are cryptographic protocols that enable a prover to convince a verifier of a statement's truth without revealing any details beyond its validity. Typically, the statement is encoded as an arithmetic circuit, and allows the prover to demonstrate that the circuit evaluates to true without revealing its inputs. Despite their potential to enhance privacy and security, ZKPs are difficult to write and optimize, limiting their adoption in machine learning and data science. To address these challenges, we introduce Zinnia, a zero-knowledge programming framework with high utility, expressiveness and efficiency for tensor-oriented computation. Zinnia provides a high-level programming language that enables developers to easily write ZKP programs, and it employs a novel symbolic execution-inspired approach to extracting semantics from these programs to generate arithmetic circuits. Zinnia supports tensor-oriented computations and provides a rich set of programming constructs, optimizations, and a powerful static type system for expressing and optimizing complex logic. We evaluate Zinnia across 25 real-world programming tasks and a user study, comparing it to existing solutions, including DSLs and zkVMs (Halo2, SP1, and RISC0). Our results demonstrate that Zinnia outperforms these baselines in utility, expressiveness, and efficiency, with a statistically significant reduction in development time, $2-3\\times$ shorter code length, 19.3% smaller circuit size, and up to $245\\times$ faster proving time compared to zkVMs, paving the way for practical ZKP applications in various domains.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has become a crucial framework for collaboratively training Machine Learning (ML) models while ensuring data privacy. Traditional synchronous FL approaches, however, suffer from delays caused by slower clients (called stragglers), which hinder the overall training process.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, in a synchronous setting, model aggregation happens once all the intended clients have submitted their local updates to the server. To address these inefficiencies, Buffered Asynchronous FL (BAsyncFL) was introduced, allowing clients to update the global model as soon as they complete local training. In such a setting, the new global model is obtained once the buffer is full, thus removing synchronization bottlenecks. Despite these advantages, existing Secure Aggregation (SA) techniques\u2014designed to protect client updates from inference attacks\u2014rely on synchronized rounds, making them unsuitable for asynchronous settings.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present Buffalo, the first practical SA protocol tailored for BAsyncFL. Buffalo leverages lattice-based encryption to handle scalability challenges in large ML models and introduces a new role, the assistant, to support the server in securely aggregating client updates. To protect against an actively corrupted server, we enable clients to verify that their local updates have been correctly integrated into the global model. Our comprehensive evaluation\u2014incorporating theoretical analysis and real-world experiments on benchmark datasets\u2014demonstrates that Buffalo is an efficient and scalable privacy-preserving solution in BAsyncFL environments.",

    "abstract": "At CRYPTO 2015, Kirchner and Fouque claimed that a carefully tuned variant of the Blum-Kalai-Wasserman (BKW) algorithm (JACM 2003) should solve the Learning with Errors problem (LWE) in slightly subexponential time for modulus $q=\\mathrm{poly}(n)$ and narrow error distribution, when given enough LWE samples. Taking a modular view, one may regard BKW as a combination of Wagner's algorithm (CRYPTO 2002), run over the corresponding dual problem, and the Aharonov-Regev distinguisher (JACM 2005). Hence the subexponential Wagner step alone should be of interest for solving this dual problem - namely, the Short Integer Solution problem (SIS) - but this appears to be undocumented so far.\r\n\r\nWe re-interpret this Wagner step as walking backward through a chain of projected lattices, zigzagging through some auxiliary superlattices. We further randomize the bucketing step using Gaussian randomized rounding to exploit the powerful discrete Gaussian machinery. This approach avoids sample amplification and turns Wagner's algorithm into an approximate discrete Gaussian sampler for $q$-ary lattices. \r\n    \r\nFor an SIS lattice with $n$ equations modulo $q$, this algorithm runs in subexponential time $\\exp(O(n/\\log \\log n))$ to reach a Gaussian width parameter $s = q/\\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ only requiring $m = n + \\omega(n/\\log \\log n)$ many SIS variables. This directly provides a provable algorithm for solving the Short Integer Solution problem in the infinity norm ($\\mathrm{SIS}^\\infty$) for norm bounds $\\beta = q/\\mathrm{polylog}(n)$. This variant of SIS underlies the security of the NIST post-quantum cryptography standard Dilithium. Despite its subexponential complexity, Wagner's algorithm does not appear to threaten Dilithium's concrete security.",

    "abstract": "Conventional Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing (PVSS) protocols allow a dealer to share a secret among $n$ parties without interaction, ensuring that any $t + 1$ parties (where $t+1 \\le n$) can recover the secret, while anyone can publicly verify the validity of both the individual shares and the reconstructed secret. PVSS schemes are shown to be a key tool in a wide range of practical applications. In this paper, we introduce Pre-constructed PVSS (PPVSS), an extension of standard PVSS schemes, highlighting its enhanced utility and efficiency in various protocols. Unlike standard PVSS, PPVSS requires the dealer to publish a commitment or encryption of the main secret and incorporates a novel secret reconstruction method. We show that these refinements make PPVSS more practical and versatile than conventional PVSS schemes. \r\nTo build a PPVSS scheme, we first point out that the well-known PVSS scheme by Schoenmakers (CRYPTO'99) and its pairing-based variant presented by Heidarvand and Villar (SAC'08) can be seen as special cases of PPVSS, where the dealer also publishes a commitment to the main secret. However, these protocols are not practical for many applications due to efficiency limitations and are less flexible compared to a standard PPVSS scheme. To address this, we propose a general strategy for transforming a Shamir-based PVSS scheme into a PPVSS scheme. Using this strategy, we construct two practical PPVSS schemes in both the Random Oracle (RO) and plain models, grounded in state-of-the-art PVSS designs. Leveraging the new RO-based PPVSS scheme, we revisit some applications and present more efficient variants. Notably, we propose a new universally verifiable e-voting protocol that improves on the alternative scheme by Schoenmakers (CRYPTO'99), reducing the verification complexity with $m$ voters from $O(n^2m)$ to $O(nm)$ exponentiations--a previously unattainable goal with standard PVSS schemes. Our implementation results demonstrate that both our proposed PPVSS schemes and the new universally verifiable e-voting protocol significantly outperform existing alternatives in terms of efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The GCM authenticated encryption (AE) scheme is one of the most widely used AE schemes in the world, while it suffers from risk of nonce misuse, short message length per encryption and an insufficient level of security. The goal of this paper is to design new AE schemes achieving stronger provable security in the standard model and accepting longer nonces (or providing nonce misuse resistance), with the design rationale behind GCM. \r\n\r\nAs a result, we propose two enhanced variants of GCM and GCM-SIV, dubbed eGCM and eGCM-SIV, respectively. eGCM and eGCM-SIV are built on top of a new CENC-type encryption mode, dubbed eCTR: using 2n-bit counters, eCTR enjoys beyond-birthday-bound security without significant loss of efficiency. eCTR is combined with an almost uniform and almost universal hash function, yielding a variable input-length variable output-length pseudorandom function, dubbed HteC. GCM and GCM-SIV are constructed using eCTR and HteC as building blocks.\r\n\r\neGCM and eGCM-SIV accept nonces of arbitrary length, and provide almost the full security (namely, n-bit security when they are based on an n-bit block cipher) for a constant maximum input length, under the assumption that the underlying block cipher is a pseudorandom permutation (PRP). Their efficiency is also comparable to GCM in terms of the rate and the overall speed.",

    "abstract": "Yao's garbled circuits have received huge attention in both theory and practice. While garbled circuits can be constructed using minimal assumption (i.e., the existence of pseudorandom functions or one-way functions), the state-of-the-art constructions (e.g., Rosulek-Roy, Crypto 2021) are based on stronger assumptions. In particular, the ``Free-XOR'' technique (Kolesnikov-Schneider, ICALP 2008) is essential in these state-of-the-art constructions, and their security can only be proven in the random oracle model, or rely on the ``circular-correlation robust hash'' assumption.  \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we aim to develop new techniques to construct efficient garbling schemes using minimal assumptions. Instead of generically replacing the Free-XOR technique, we focus on garbling schemes for specific functionalities. We successfully eliminated the need for Free-XOR in several state-of-the-art schemes, including the one-hot garbling (Heath and Kolesnikov, CCS 2021) and the garbled pseudorandom functions, and the garbled lookup tables (Heath, Kolesnikov and Ng, Eurocrypt 2024). Our schemes are based on minimal assumptions, i.e., standard pseudorandom functions (PRFs)---we resolved the need for circular security. The performance of our scheme is almost as efficient as the best results except for a small constant factor. Namely, for any lookup table $\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}^m$, our scheme takes $n + (5n+9)m\\lambda + 2^n \\cdot m$ bits of communication, where $\\lambda$ is the security parameter of PRF.",

    "abstract": "Know Your Customer (KYC) is a core component of the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) framework, designed to prevent illicit activities within financial systems. However, enforcing KYC and AML on blockchains remains challenging due to difficulties in establishing accountability and preserving user privacy. This study proposes REGKYC, a privacy-preserving Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) framework that balances user privacy with externally mandated KYC and AML requirements. REGKYC leverages a structured ABAC model to support the flexible verification of KYC attributes and the enforcement of compliance policies, providing benefits to multiple stakeholders. First, it enables legitimate users to meet compliance requirements while preserving the privacy of their on-chain activities. Second, it empowers Crypto-asset Service Providers (CASPs) to tailor compliance policies to operational needs, ensuring adaptability to evolving regulations. Finally, it enhances regulatory accountability by enabling authorized deanonymization of malicious actors. We hope this work inspires future research to harmonize user privacy and regulatory compliance in blockchain systems.",

    "abstract": "The Middle-Product Learning with Errors (MPLWE) assumption is a variant of the Learning with Errors (LWE) assumption. The MPLWE assumption reduces the key size of corresponding LWE-based schemes by setting keys as sets of polynomials. Moreover, MPLWE has more robust security than other LWE variants such as Ring-LWE\r\nand Module-LWE. Lombardi et al. proposed an identity-based encryption (IBE) scheme (LVV-IBE) based on the MPLWE assumption in the random oracle model (ROM) by following Gentry et al.'s IBE scheme (GPV-IBE) based on LWE. Due to the benefit of MPLWE, LVV-IBE has a shorter master public key and a secret key than GPV-IBE without changing the size of a ciphertext. However, Lombardi et al.'s proof is not tight in the ROM, while Katsumata et al. proved that GPV-IBE achieves tight adaptive anonymity in the quantum ROM (QROM). Revocable IBE (RIBE) is a variant of IBE supporting a key revocation mechanism to remove malicious users from the system. Takayasu proposed the most efficient RIBE scheme (Takayasu-RIBE) based on LWE achieving tight adaptive anonymity in the QROM. Although a concrete RIBE scheme based on MPLWE has not been proposed, we can construct a scheme (LVV-based RIBE) by applying Ma and Lin's generic transformation to LVV-IBE. Due to the benefit of MPLWE, LVV-based RIBE has an asymptotically shorter master public key and a shorter secret key than Takayasu-RIBE although the former has a larger ciphertext than the latter. Moreover, the security proof is not tight and anonymous in the ROM due to security proofs of Ma-Lin and Lombardi et al. In this paper, we propose a concrete RIBE scheme based on MPLWE. Compared with the above RIBE schemes, the proposed RIBE scheme is the most asymptotically efficient since the sizes of a master public key and a secret key (resp. ciphertext) of the proposed scheme are the same as those of LVV-based RIBE scheme (resp. Takayasu-RIBE). Moreover, we prove the tight adaptive anonymity of the proposed RIBE scheme in the QROM. For this purpose, we also prove the tight adaptive anonymity of LVV-IBE in the QROM.",

    "abstract": "Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is a promising primitive for evaluating arbitrary circuits while keeping the user's privacy. We investigate how to use HE in the multi-party setting where data is encrypted with several distinct keys. One may use the Multi-Key Homomorphic Encryption (MKHE) in this setting, but it has space/computation overhead of $\\mathcal O(n)$ for the number of users $n$, which makes it impractical when $n$ grows large. On the contrary, Multi-Party Homomorphic Encryption (MPHE) is the other Homomorphic Encryption primitive in the multi-party setting, where the space/computation overhead is $\\mathcal O(1)$; however, is limited in terms of ciphertext reusability and dynamicity, that ciphertexts are encrypted just for a group of parties and cannot be reused for other purposes, and that additional parties cannot join the computation dynamically. \r\n\r\nContrary to MKHE, where the secret key owners engage only in the decryption phase, we consider a more relaxed situation where the secret key owners can communicate before the computation. In that case, we can reduce the size of a ciphertext and the evaluation complexity from $\\mathcal O(n)$ to $\\mathcal O(1)$ as in a single-key HE setting. We call this primitive as {\\em Reusable Dynamic Multi-Party Homomorphic Encryption}, which is more suitable in real-world scenarios.\r\n\r\nWe show that 1) the procedures before the computation can be done in a very few rounds of communications, 2) the evaluation/space complexities are independent of the number of users, and 3) the functionalities are as efficient as MKHE, with asymptotic analysis and with implementation.",

    "abstract": "The Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Standard (ML-DSA), formerly known as CRYSTALS-Dilithium, is a lattice-based post-quantum cryptographic scheme. In August 2024, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) officially standardized ML-DSA under FIPS 204. Dilithium generates one valid signature and multiple rejected signatures during the signing process. Most Side-Channel Attacks targeting Dilithium have focused solely on the valid signature, while neglecting the hints contained in rejected signatures. In this paper, we propose a method for recovering the private key by simultaneously leveraging side-channel leakages from both valid signatures and rejected signatures. This approach minimizes the number of signing attempts required for full key recovery. We construct a factor graph incorporating all relevant side-channel leakages and apply the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm for private key recovery.\r\n\r\nWe conducted a proof-of-concept experiment on a Cortex M4 core chip, where the results demonstrate that utilizing rejected signatures reduces the required number of traces by at least $42\\%$ for full key recovery. A minimum of a single trace can recover the private key with a success rate of $30\\%$. Our findings highlight that protecting rejected signatures is crucial, as their leakage provides valuable side-channel information. We strongly recommend implementing countermeasures for rejected signatures during the signing process to mitigate potential threats.",

    "abstract": "In 2012, the Tor project expressed the need to upgrade Tor's onion encryption scheme to protect against tagging attacks and thereby strengthen its end-to-end integrity protection. Tor proposal 261, where each encryption layer is processed by a strongly secure, yet relatively expensive tweakable wide-block cipher, is the only concrete candidate replacement to be backed by formal, yet partial, security proofs (Degabriele and Stam, EUROCRYPT 2018, and Rogaway and Zhang, PoPETS 2018).\r\n\r\nWe propose an alternative onion encryption scheme, called Counter Galois Onion (CGO), that follows a minimalistic, modular design and includes several improvements over proposal 261. CGO's underlying primitive is an updatable tweakable split-domain cipher accompanied with a new security notion, that augments the recently introduced rugged pseudorandom permutation (Degabriele and Karad\u017ei\u0107, CRYPTO 2022). Thus, we relax the security compared to a tweakable wide-block cipher, allowing for more efficient designs. We suggest a concrete instantiation for the updatable tweakable split-domain cipher and report on our experiments comparing the performance of CGO with Tor's existing onion encryption scheme.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\r\nThe Singularity Random Number Generator (SRNG) represents a groundbreaking advancement in the generation of random numbers by integrating two key properties - computational irreducibility and seed independence - into a deterministic algorithm. Unlike conventional pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) whose randomness is intrinsically linked to seed quality or chaotic sensitivity, SRNG transforms even low-entropy seeds into complex, unpredictable outputs. SRNG demonstrates high-quality randomness can emerge independently of seed entropy or size. This paper explores how SRNG not only challenges classical paradigms of predictability in deterministic systems but also offers transformative applications in cryptography, artificial intelligence (AI), and interdisciplinary research. Furthermore, by drawing parallels with cognitive variability research - such as insights from the Forbes article \u201cWhy A \u2018Productively Distracted\u2019 Brain Is A Superpower\u201d - we discuss how the emergent unpredictability of SRNG may contribute to enhanced adaptive learning and decision-making processes in AI systems. Ultimately, SRNG is presented as a model that bridges the realms of science and mystery, inviting a new understanding of randomness and the limits of scientific inquiry, thereby expanding the frontiers of interdisciplinary research.",

    "abstract": "Key-exfiltration attacks on cryptographic keys are a significant threat to computer security. One proposed defense against such attacks is big-key cryptography which seeks to make cryptographic secrets so large that it is infeasible for an adversary to exfiltrate the key (without being detected). However, this also introduces an inconvenience to the user who must now store the large key on all of their different devices. The work of D\u00f6ttling, Garg, Sekar and Wang (TCC 2022) introduces an elegant solution to this problem in the form of big-key identity-based encryption (IBE). Here, there is a large master secret key, but very short identity keys. The user can now store the large master secret key as her long-term key, and can provision each of her devices with short ephemeral identity keys (say, corresponding to the current date). In this way, the long-term secret key is protected by conventional big-key cryptography, while the user only needs to distribute short ephemeral keys to their different devices. D\u00f6ttling et al. introduce and construct big-key IBE from standard pairing-based assumptions. However, their scheme only satisfies selective security where the adversary has to declare its challenge set of identities at the beginning of the security game. The more natural notion of security is adaptive security where the user can adaptively choose which identities it wants to challenge after seeing the public parameters (and part of the master secret key).\r\n\r\nIn this work, we give the first adaptively-secure construction of big-key IBE from standard cryptographic assumptions. Our first construction relies on indistinguishability obfuscation (and one-way functions), while our second construction relies on witness encryption for NP together with standard pairing-based assumptions (i.e., the SXDH assumption). To prove adaptive security, we show how to implement the classic dual-system methodology with indistinguishability obfuscation as well as witness encryption.",

    "abstract": "In lattice-based cryptography, many attacks are performed by finding a short enough vector on a specific lattice. However, it is possible that length is not the only restriction on the vector to be found. A typical example is SVP with infinity norm: since most SVP solving algorithms only aim to find short vector under Euclidean norm, the infinity norm is in fact another restriction on the vector. In the literature, such problems are usually solved by performing exhaustive search on a list of short vectors generated from lattice sieving. However, the sieving list might either be too large or too small to pass the additional restriction, which makes the solving algorithm inefficient in some cases.\r\n\r\nOur contribution in this work is as follows: (1) We formally define a new lattice hard problem called restricted SVP, and show that it can be used to generalize many lattice hard problems, including SVP with non-Euclidean norm and Kannan's embedding on approximate CVP. (2) We extend the dimension for free technique and the enumerate-then-slice technique into approximate SVP where the goal is to output a list of short vectors with a certain size. (3) We give the heuristic algorithm for solving restricted SVP, and design a hardness estimator for this algorithm, which can be used to estimate the concrete hardness of signature forgery in Dilithium and other lattice-based signatures. Using this estimator, we present a concrete security analysis for Dilithium against signature forgery under the gate-count model for the first time. Our estimation matches well with the security estimation from core-SVP model in the document of Dilithium, and we also combine our estimator with the rescaling technique to generate a tighter estimation.",

    "abstract": "The Ethereum Global Network (EGN) is the peer-to-peer (P2P) network underlying Ethereum and thousands of subsequent blockchain services. Deviating from traditional single-service P2P networks, EGN's multi-service architecture has gained widespread acceptance for supposedly improving node discovery efficiency and security. This paper challenges this belief by critically examining EGN's design and its purported benefits. Our analysis reveals significant shortcomings in EGN's node discovery process. EGN nodes struggle to connect with peers offering the desired service: over three-quarters of connection attempts reach nodes of other services. In an extreme case, one node spent an average of $45\\,908$ connection attempts to find each neighbor. Moreover, this blended architecture compromises EGN's security. The network demonstrates high susceptibility to DHT pollution and partition attacks. Even with only $300$ malicious nodes in EGN, an attacker can isolate thousands of nodes, significantly hindering recovery. In contrast, such a small number of malicious nodes has minimal impact on every single-service P2P network. We propose solutions to improve EGN's node discovery efficiency and strengthen its resilience against attacks.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we present for the first time a cross-core Prime+Probe attack on ARM\r\nTrustZone, which bypasses the AutoLock mechanism. We introduce our simulation-\r\ndriven methodology based on gem5 for vulnerability analysis. We demonstrate its\r\nutility in reverse engineering a SoC platform in order to study its microarchitectural\r\nbehavior (caches, etc.), inside a simulator, in spite of hardware protection. We present\r\na novel vulnerability analysis technique, which takes into account the cache set\r\noccupancy for targeted victim executable. This proves to be essential in identifying\r\ninformation leakage in presence of AutoLock. The above tool also identifies the cache\r\nlines leaking a maximum amount of information. A cross-core Prime+Probe attack is\r\nthen mounted on these max-leakage cache lines both in simulation for fine-tuning,\r\nand in real hardware. We validate our analysis and attack method on OP-TEE, an\r\nopen-source trusted execution environment running on RockPi4 a board based on\r\nRK3399 SoC. More specifically we target the RSA subroutine in the MbedTLS library\r\nused inside OP-TEE. Despite the presence of AutoLock, multiplier obfuscation, and\r\nassuming a cross-core attack, we are able to retrieve 30% of the key bits, which can\r\nlater be used in Branch-and-Prune methods to recover the full key.",

    "abstract": "Secure graph computation enables computing on graphs while hiding the graph topology as well as the associated node/edge data. This facilitates collaborative analysis among multiple data owners, who may only hold a private partial view of the global graph. Several works address this problem using the technique of secure multiparty computation (MPC) in the presence of 2 or 3 parties. However, when moving to the multiparty setting, as required for collaborative analysis among multiple data owners, these solutions are no longer scalable. This remains true with respect to the state-of-the-art framework of $\\mathsf{Graphiti}$ (Koti et al., CCS 2024) as well. Specifically, $\\mathsf{Graphiti}$ incurs a round complexity linear in the number of parties or data owners. This is due to its reliance on secure shuffle protocol, constituting a bottleneck in the multiparty setting. Additionally, $\\mathsf{Graphiti}$ has a prohibitively expensive initialisation phase due to its reliance on secure sort, with a round complexity dependent on both the graph size and the number of parties. \r\n\r\nWe propose $\\mathsf{emGraph}$, a generic framework for secure graph computation in the multiparty setting that eliminates the need of shuffle and instead, relies on a weaker primitive known as $\\mathsf{Permute+Share}$. Further $\\mathsf{emGraph}$ is designed to have a lightweight initialisation, that eliminates the need for sorting, making its round complexity independent of the graph size and number of parties. Unlike any of the prior works, achieving a round complexity independent of the number of parties is what makes $\\mathsf{emGraph}$ scalable.\r\n\r\nFinally, we implement and benchmark the performance of $\\mathsf{emGraph}$ for the application of PageRank computation and showcase its efficiency and scalability improvements over $\\mathsf{Graphiti}$. Concretely, we witness improvements of up to $80\\times$ in runtime in comparison to state-of-the-art framework $\\mathsf{Graphiti}$. Further, we observe that $\\mathsf{emGraph}$ takes under a minute to perform 10 iterations of PageRank computation on a graph of size $10^6$ that is distributed among $25$ parties/data owners, making it highly practical for secure graph computation in the multiparty setting.",

    "abstract": "Bitcoin script cannot easily access and store state information onchain without an upgrade such as BIP-347 (OP_CAT); this makes performing general (stateful) computation on Bitcoin impossible to do directly. Despite this limitation, several approaches have been proposed to bypass it, with BitVM being by far the most production-ready of them. BitVM enables fraud-proof-based computation on Bitcoin, relying on a $1$-out-of-$n$ honesty assumption.\r\n\r\nThis left the question of whether it is possible to achieve computation under the same honesty assumption without requiring onlookers to ensure validity through fraud proofs.  In this note, we answer this question affirmatively by introducing ColliderVM, a new approach for performing computation on Bitcoin today. Crucially, this approach eliminates some capital inefficiency concerns stemming from reliance on fraud proofs.\r\n\r\nFor our construction, a key point is to replace the Lamport or Winternitz signature-based storage component in contemporary protocols with a hash collision-based commitment. With it, we estimate that the Bitcoin script length for STARK proof verification is drastically shorter than that for other pairing-based proof systems used today in applications.",

    "abstract": "The modern internet relies heavily on centralized trust systems controlled by corporations, governments, and intermediaries to manage authentication, identity, and value transfer. These models introduce fundamental vulnerabilities, including censorship, fraud, and systemic insecurity. The Decentralized State Machine (DSM) addresses these issues by introducing a mathematically enforced trust layer that eliminates the need for consensus mechanisms, third-party validators, and centralized infrastructure. DSM enables quantum-resistant, deterministic state transitions for digital identity and value exchange\u2014offering immediate finality, offline capability, and tamper-proof forward-only state progression.\r\n\r\nDSM replaces traditional blockchain execution models with deterministic, pre-committed state transitions, enabling secure, multi-path workflows without requiring Turing-completeness or global consensus. The protocol architecture is based on a straight hash chain with sparse indexing and Sparse Merkle Trees (SMTs), ensuring efficient verification, scalability, and privacy. A bilateral isolation model supports asynchronous, offline operation with built-in consistency guarantees. DSM introduces a sustainable, gas-free economic model based on cryptographic subscription commitments.\r\n\r\nThis paper outlines the architecture, cryptographic foundations, and security guarantees of DSM, and demonstrates how it achieves verifiable, trustless interaction between peers\u2014both online and offline. By decoupling security from consensus and enabling self-validating state transitions, DSM offers a practical and scalable alternative to conventional internet trust models.",

    "abstract": "An oblivious RAM (ORAM) compiler is a cryptographic tool that transforms a program $P$ running in time $n$ into an equivalent program $\\tilde P$, with the property that the sequence of memory addresses read from/written to by $\\tilde P$ reveal nothing about $\\tilde P$'s data (Goldreich and Ostrovsky, JACM'96). An efficient ORAM compiler $C$ should achieve some combination of the following:\r\n\r\n- Low bandwidth blow-up: $\\tilde P$ should read/write a similar amount of data as does P.\r\n- Low latency: $\\tilde P$ should incur a similar number of roundtrips to the memory as does P.\r\n- Low space complexity: $\\tilde P$ should run in as few words of local memory as possible.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that for a generic compiler (i.e. one that works for any RAM program $P$), certain combinations of efficiencies are impossible. Any generic ORAM compiler must incur $\\Omega(\\log n)$ bandwidth blow-up, and any ORAM compiler with no latency blow-up must incur either $\\Omega(\\sqrt n)$ bandwidth blow-up and/or local space. Moreover, while a $O(\\log n)$ bandwidth blow-up compiler is known, it requires the assumption that one-way functions exist and incurs enormous constant factors.\r\n\r\nTo circumvent the above problems and improve efficiency of particular ORAM programs, we develop a compiler for a specific class of programs. Let $P$ be a program that interacts with an immutable memory. Namely, $P$ may write values to memory, then read them back, but it cannot change values that were already written. Using only information-theoretic techniques, we compile any such $P$ into an oblivious form $\\tilde P$ with a combination of efficiencies that no generic ORAM compiler can achieve:\r\n\r\n- $\\tilde P$ incurs $\\Theta(\\log n)$ amortized bandwidth blow-up.\r\n- $\\tilde P$ incurs $O(1)$ amortized latency blow-up.\r\n- $\\tilde P$ runs in $O(\\lambda)$ words of local space ($\\tilde P$ incurs an error with probability $2^{-\\Omega(\\lambda)}$).\r\n\r\nWe show that this, for instance, implies that any pure functional program can be compiled with the same asymptotics.\r\n\r\nOur work builds on and is compatible with prior work  (Appan et al., CCS'24) that showed similar results for pointer machine programs that manipulate objects with constant in-degree (i.e., the program may only maintain a constant number of pointers to any one memory cell; our immutable memory approach does not have this limitation). By combining techniques, we can consider programs that interact with a mixed memory that allows each memory cell to be updated until it is frozen, after which it becomes immutable, allowing further reads to be compiled with the above asymptotics, even when in-degree is high. Many useful algorithms/data structures can be naturally implemented as mixed memory programs, including suffix trees (powerful data structures used in computational biology) and deterministic finite automata (DFAs).",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present efficient SNARKs for Boolean circuits, achieving significant improvements in the prover efficiency. The core of our technique is a novel tower sumcheck protocol and a tower zero-check protocol tailored for tower fields, which enable this efficiency boost. When instantiated with Wiedemann's binary tower fields with the base field of $GF(2)$ and the top-level field $GF(2^{2^\\ell})$, assuming the quadratic complexity of multiplications \\(O(2^{2\\ell})\\) in the top-level field with $2^\\ell$ bits, the prover time of our sumcheck protocol is \\(O(2^{1.5\\ell}N)\\). It is faster than the standard sumcheck protocol over the large field with the complexity of \\(O(2^{2\\ell}N)\\). To achieve a reasonable security level, $2^\\ell$ is usually set to $128$.\r\n\r\nLeveraging this advancement, we improve the efficiency of IOP protocols over the binary or small characteristic fields for Plonkish, CCS, and GKR-based constraint systems. Moreover, to further improve the prover efficiency of the SNARKs, we introduce a basis-switching mechanism that efficiently transforms polynomial evaluations on the base-field polynomial to evaluations on the tower-field polynomial. With the basis-switching, we are able to compile the binary-field IOPs to SNARKs using large-field polynomial commitment schemes (PCS) that batch the witness over the base field. The size of the large-field PCS is only $\\frac{1}{2^\\ell}$ of the size of the witness over the base field. Combining the IOP and the PCS, the overall prover time of our SNARKs for Boolean circuits significantly faster than the naive approach of encoding Boolean values in a large field.",

    "abstract": "In CRYPTO 2022, Esser et al. proposed a partial key exposure attack on several post-quantum cryptographic schemes including Rainbow which is a variant of UOV. The task of the attack is to recover a full secret key from its partial information such as a secret key with symmetric/asymmetric bit errors. One of the techniques Esser et al. developed is a partial enumeration that combines the standard algorithms to solve the MQ problem with enumeration. \r\n\r\nAlthough an efficient attack on Rainbow was proposed, UOV and its variants have still been paid much attention since UOV and its three variants, i.e., MAYO, QR-UOV and SNOVA, were selected as the Round 2 candidates of the additional call for digital signature schemes proposal by NIST. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we analyze partial key exposure attacks on UOV, MAYO, and QR-UOV. Although our proposed attacks use the partial enumeration, we refine their enumeration strategy. We employ two enumeration strategies and analyze the complexity of the proposed attacks. Then, we find a structural difference between UOV and its variants to resist partial enumeration. Specifically, the partial enumeration is effective if the number of vinegar variables is smaller than the number of equations and the order of a finite field is small. \r\n\r\nAs a result, the proposed attack is the most effective on MAYO. While our attacks on UOV and QR-UOV are effective only when the symmetric error probabilities are 0.11 and 0.05, respectively, that on MAYO is effective even when the probability is close to 0.5.",

    "abstract": "The matrix code equivalence problem consists, given two matrix spaces $\\mathcal{C},\\mathcal{D}\\subset \\mathbb{F}_q^{m\\times n}$ of dimension $k$, in finding invertible matrices $P\\in\\textrm{GL}_m(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ and $Q\\in\\textrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ such that $\\mathcal{D} =P\\mathcal{C} Q^{-1}$. Recent signature schemes such as MEDS and ALTEQ relate their security to the hardness of this problem. Naranayan et. al. recently published an algorithm solving this problem in the case $k = n =m$ in $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(q^{\\frac k 2})$ operations. We present a different algorithm which solves the problem in the general case. Our approach consists in reducing the problem to the matrix code conjugacy problem, i.e. the case $P=Q$. For the latter problem, similarly to the permutation code equivalence problem in Hamming metric, a natural invariant based on the \\emph{Hull} of the code can be used. Next, the equivalence of codes can be deduced using a usual list collision argument. For $k=m=n$, our algorithm achieves the same complexity as in the aforementioned reference. However, it extends to a much broader range of parameters.",

    "abstract": "More and more people take advantage of mobile apps to strike up relationships and casual contacts. This sometimes results in the sharing of self-generated nudes. While this opens a way for sexual exploration, it also raises concerns. In this paper, we review existing technology-assisted permissive proposals/features that provide security or privacy benefits when sharing nudes online. To do so, we performed a systematic literature review combing through 10,026 search results and cross-references, and we identified real-world solutions by surveying OS features and 52 dating, messaging and social network apps. We systematized knowledge by defining a sexting threat model, deriving a taxonomy of the proposals/features, discussing some of their shortcomings, organizing privacy-related concepts, and providing take-aways with some directions for future research and development. Our study found a very diverse ecosystem of academic proposals and app features, showing that safer sexting goes far beyond nude detection. None of the techniques represents the ultimate solution for all threats, but each contributes to safer sexting in a different way.",

    "abstract": "We give an IOPP (interactive oracle proof of proximity) for trivariate Reed-Muller codes that achieves  the best known query complexity in some range of security parameters. Specifically, for degree $d$ and security parameter $\\lambda\\leq \\frac{\\log^2 d}{\\log\\log d}$  , our IOPP has $2^{-\\lambda}$ round-by-round soundness, $O(\\lambda)$ queries, $O(\\log\\log d)$ rounds and $O(d)$ length. This improves upon the FRI [Ben-Sasson, Bentov, Horesh, Riabzev, ICALP 2018] and the STIR [Arnon, Chiesa, Fenzi, Yogev, Crypto 2024] IOPPs for Reed-Solomon codes, that have larger query and round complexity standing at $O(\\lambda \\log d)$ and  $O(\\log d+\\lambda\\log\\log d)$ respectively. We use our IOPP to give an IOP for the NP-complete language Rank-1-Constraint-Satisfaction with the same parameters.\r\n\r\n    Our construction is based on the line versus point test in the low-soundness regime. Compared to the axis parallel test (which is used in all prior works), the general affine lines test has improved soundness, which is the main source of our improved soundness.  \r\n    \r\n    Using this test involves several complications, most significantly that projection to affine lines does not preserve individual degrees, and we show how to overcome these difficulties. En route, we extend some existing machinery to more general settings. Specifically, we give proximity generators for Reed-Muller codes, show a more systematic way of handling \"side conditions\" in IOP constructions, and generalize the compiling procedure of [Arnon, Chiesa, Fenzi, Yogev, Crypto 2024] to general codes.",

    "abstract": "The transition to quantum-safe public-key cryptography has begun: for key agreement, NIST has standardized ML-KEM and selected HQC for future standardization. The relative immaturity of these schemes encourages crypto-agile implementations, to facilitate easy transitions between them. Intelligent crypto-agility requires efficient sharing strategies to compute operations from different cryptosystems using the same resources. This is particularly challenging for cryptosystems with distinct mathematical foundations, like lattice-based ML-KEM and code-based HQC.\r\nWe introduce PHOENIX, the first crypto-agile hardware coprocessor for lattice- and code-based cryptosystems--specifically, ML-KEM and HQC, at all three NIST security levels--with an effective agile sharing strategy.\r\nPHOENIX accelerates polynomial multiplication, which is the main operation in both cryptosystems, and the current bottleneck of HQC. To maximise sharing, we replace HQC's Karatsuba-based polynomial multiplication with the Frobenius Additive FFT (FAFFT), which is similar on an abstract level to ML-KEM's Number Theoretic Transform (NTT). \r\nWe show that the FAFFT already brings substantial performance improvements in software. In hardware, our sharing strategy for the FAFFT and NTT is based on a new SuperButterfly unit that seamlessly switches between these two FFT variants over completely different rings. This is, to our knowledge, the first FAFFT hardware accelerator of any kind. We have integrated PHOENIX in a real System-on-Chip FPGA scenario, where our performance measurements show that efficient crypto-agility for lattice- and code-based KEMs can be achieved with low overhead.",

    "abstract": "Sanitizable Signature Schemes (SSS) enable a designated party, the sanitizer, to modify predefined parts of a signed message without invalidating the signature, making them useful for applications like pseudonymization and redaction. Since their introduction by Ateniese et al. (ESORICS'05), several classical SSS constructions have been proposed, but none have been instantiated from quantum-resistant assumptions. In this work, we develop the first quantum-secure sanitizable signature schemes based on lattice assumptions. Our primary focus is on SSS constructions that rely on chameleon hash functions (CHFs), a key component for enabling the controlled modification of messages. While lattice-based CHFs exist, they do not meet the required security guarantees for SSS, becoming insecure under adversarial access to an adapt oracle. To address this, we construct a novel lattice-based CHF that achieves collision resistance even in such settings, called full collision resistance. However, our CHF lacks the uniqueness property, a limitation we show to be inherent in lattice-based CHFs. As a result, our SSS constructions initially fall short of achieving the critical security property of accountability. To overcome this, we apply a transformation based on verifiable ring signatures (VRS), for which we present the first lattice-based instantiation. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of existing classical SSS constructions, explore their potential for post-quantum instantiations, and present new attacks on previously assumed secure SSS schemes. Our work closes the gap in constructing quantum-secure SSS and lays the groundwork for further research into advanced cryptographic primitives based on lattice assumptions.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the Byzantine Agreement problem in synchronous systems where Byzantine agents can move from process to process, corrupting their host. \r\nWe focus on three representative models: \\emph{Garay's}, \\emph{Bonnet's} and \\emph{Buhrman's} models.\r\nIn \\emph{Garay's model} when a process has been left by the Byzantine, it is in the \\emph{cured} state and it is aware of its condition and thus can remain silent for a round to prevent the dissemination of wrong information.\r\nIn \\emph{Bonnet's model} a cured process may send messages (based on a state corrupted by the malicious agent), however it will behave correctly in the way it sends those messages: i.e., send messages according to the algorithm.\r\nIn \\emph{Buhrman's model} Byzantine agents move together with the message.  \r\nIt has been shown that in order to solve Byzantine Agreement in the \\emph{Garay's model} at least $4t+1$ processors are needed, for \\emph{Bonnet's model} at least $5t+1$ processors are needed, while for \\emph{Buhrman's model} at least $3t+1$ processors are needed.\r\nIn this paper we target to increase the tolerance to mobile Byzantines by integrating a trusted counter abstraction to the above models. This abstraction prevents nodes to equivocate. In the new models we prove that at least $3t+1$, respectively $4t+1$, and $2t+1$ processors are needed  to tolerate $t$ mobile Byzantine agents. Furthermore,  we propose novel Mobile Byzantine Agreement algorithms that  match these new lower bounds for \\emph{Garay's}, \\emph{Bonnet's} and \\emph{Buhrman's} models.",

    "abstract": "Laconic cryptography focuses on designing two-message protocols that allow secure computation on large datasets while minimizing communication costs. While laconic cryptography protocols achieve asymptotically optimal communication complexity for many tasks, their concrete efficiency is prohibitively expensive due to the heavy use of public-key techniques or the non-black-box of cryptographic primitives.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we initiate the study of \"laconic cryptography with preprocessing\", introducing a model that includes an offline phase to generate database-dependent correlations, which are then used in a lightweight online phase. These correlations are conceptually simple, relying on linear-algebraic techniques. This enables us to develop a protocol for private laconic vector oblivious linear evaluation (plvOLE). In such a protocol, the receiver holds a large database $\\mathsf{DB}$, and the sender has two messages $v$ and $w$, along with an index $i$. The receiver learns the value $v \\cdot \\mathsf{DB}_i + w$ without revealing other information.\r\n\r\nOur protocol, which draws from ideas developed in the context of private information retrieval with preprocessing, serves as the backbone for two applications of interest: laconic private set intersection (lPSI) for large universes and laconic function evaluation for RAM-programs (RAM-LFE). Based our plvOLE protocol, we provide efficient instantiations of these two primitives in the preprocessing model.",

    "abstract": "The security of ML-DSA, like most signature schemes, is partially based on the fact that the nonce used to generate the signature is unknown to any attacker. In this work, we exhibit a lattice-based attack that is possible if the nonces share implicit or explicit information. From a collection of signatures whose nonces share certain coefficients, it is indeed possible to build a collection of non full-rank lattices. Intersecting them, we show how to create a low-rank lattice that contains one of the polynomials of the secret key, which in turn can be recovered using lattice reduction techniques. \r\n\r\nThere are several interpretations of this result: firstly, it can be seen as a generalization of a fault-based attack on BLISS presented at SAC'16 by Thomas Espitau et al. Alternatively, it can be understood as a side-channel attack on ML-DSA, in the case where an attacker is able to recover only one of the coefficients of the nonce used during the generation of the signature. For ML-DSA-II, we show that $4 \\times 160$ signatures and few hours of computation are sufficient to recover the secret key on a desktop computer. Lastly, our result shows that simple countermeasures, such as permuting the generation of the nonce coefficients, are not sufficient.",

    "abstract": "Physically Unclonable Constants (PUCs) are a special type of Physically Unclonable Constants and they can be used to embed secret bit-strings in chips. Most PUCs are an array of cells where each cell is a digital circuit that evolve spontaneously toward one of two states, the chosen state being function of random manufacturing process variations. In this paper we propose an Analog Physically Unclonable Constant (APUC) whose output is an analog value to be transformed in digital by a digitizer circuit. The ratio behind this proposal is that an APUC cell has the potential of providing more than one bit, reducing the required footprint. Preliminary theoretical analysis and simulation results are presented. The proposed APUC has interesting performances (e.g., it can provide up to 5 bits per cell) that grant for further investigation.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents new results that establish connections between isogeny graphs and nonlinear recurrences over finite fields. Specifically, we prove several theorems that link these two areas, offering deeper insights into the structure of isogeny graphs and their relationship with nonlinear recurrence sequences. We further provide two related conjectures which may be worth of further research. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the endomorphism ring of a curve, advancing progress toward the resolution of the Endomorphism Ring Problem, which aims to provide a computational characterization of the endomorphism ring of a supersingular elliptic curve.",

    "abstract": "A Random Oracle Combiner (ROC), introduced by Dodis et al. (CRYPTO \u201922), takes two hash functions $h_1, h_2$ from m bits to n bits and outputs a new hash function $C$ from $m$' to $n$' bits. This function C is guaranteed to be indifferentiable from a fresh random oracle as long as one of $h_1$ and $h_2$ (say, $h_1$) is a random oracle, while the other h2 can \u201carbitrarily depend\u201d on $h_1$.\r\n\r\nThe work of Dodis et al. also built the first length-preserving ROC, where $n$\u2032 = $n$. Unfortunately, despite this feasibility result, this construction has several deficiencies. From the practical perspective, it could not be directly applied to existing Merkle-Damg\u00e5rd-based hash\r\nfunctions, such as SHA2 or SHA3. From the theoretical perspective, it required $h_1$ and $h_2$ to have input length $m$ > 3\u03bb, where \u03bb is the security parameter.\r\n\r\nTo overcome these limitations, Dodis et al. conjectured \u2014 and left as the main open question \u2014 that the following (salted) construction is a length-preserving ROC:\r\n\r\n$C^{h1,h2}_{\\mathcal{Z}_1,\\mathcal{Z}_2} (M ) = h_1^*(M, \\mathcal{Z}_1) \\oplus h^*_2(M,\\mathcal{Z}_2),$\r\n\r\nwhere $\\mathcal{Z}_1, \\mathcal{Z}_2$ are random salts of appropriate length, and $f^*$ denotes the Merkle-Damg\u00e5rd-extension of a given compression function $f$. As our main result, we resolve this conjecture in the affirmative. For practical use, this makes the resulting combiner applicable to existing, Merkle-Damg\u00e5rd-based hash functions. On the theory side, it shows the existence of ROCs only requiring optimal input length $m$ = \u03bb+O(1).",

    "abstract": "CRLite is a low-bandwidth, low-latency, privacy-preserving mechanism for distributing certificate revocation data. A CRLite aggregator periodically encodes revocation data into a compact static hash set, or membership test, which can can be downloaded by clients and queried privately. We present a novel data-structure for membership tests, which we call a clubcard, and we evaluate the encoding efficiency of clubcards using data from Mozilla's CRLite infrastructure.\r\n\r\nAs of November 2024, the WebPKI contains over 900 million valid certificates and over 8 million revoked certificates. We describe an instantiation of CRLite that encodes the revocation status of these certificates in a 6.7 MB package. This is $54\\%$ smaller than the original instantiation of CRLite presented at the 2017 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, and it is $21\\%$ smaller than the lower bound claimed in that work.\r\n\r\nA sequence of clubcards can encode a dynamic dataset like the WebPKI revocation set. Using data from late 2024 again, we find that clubcards encoding 6 hour delta updates to the WebPKI can be compressed to 26.8 kB on average---a size that makes CRLite truly practical.\r\n\r\nWe have extended Mozilla's CRLite infrastructure so that it can generate clubcards, and we have added client-side support for this system to Firefox. We report on some performance aspects of our implementation, which is currently the default revocation checking mechanism in Firefox Nightly, and we propose strategies for further reducing the bandwidth requirements of CRLite.",

    "abstract": "Recently, $\\mathsf{NTRU}$+$\\mathsf{Sign}$ was proposed as a new compact signature scheme, following `Fiat-Shamir with Aborts' (FSwA) framework. Its compactness is mainly based on their novel NTRU-based key structure that fits well with bimodal distributions in the FSwA framework. However, despite its compactness, $\\mathsf{NTRU}$+$\\mathsf{Sign}$ fails to provide a diverse set of parameters that can meet some desired security levels. This limitation stems from its reliance on a ring $\\mathbb{Z}_q[x]/\\langle x^n+1 \\rangle$, where $n$ is restricted to powers of two, limiting the flexibility in selecting appropriate security levels. To overcome this limitation, we propose a revised version of $\\mathsf{NTRU}$+$\\mathsf{Sign}$ by adopting a ring $\\mathbb{Z}_q[x]/\\langle x^n-x^{n/2}+1\\rangle$ from cyclotomic trinomials, where $n=2^{i}3^{j}$ for some positive integers $i$ and $j$. Our parameterization offers three distinct security levels: approximately $120$, $190$, and $260$ bits, while preserving the compactness in $\\mathbb{Z}_q[x]/\\langle x^n+1 \\rangle$. We implement these re-parameterized $\\mathsf{NTRU}$+$\\mathsf{Sign}$ schemes, showing that the performance of $\\mathsf{NTRU}$+$\\mathsf{Sign}$ from cyclotomic trinomials is still comparable to previous lattice-based signature schemes such as $\\mathsf{Dilithium}$ and $\\mathsf{HAETAE}$.",

    "abstract": "Semantic communication systems, which focus on transmitting the semantics of data rather than its exact reconstruction, redefine the design of communication networks for transformative efficiency in bandwidth-limited and latency-critical applications. Addressing these goals, we tackle the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) problem for image compression, a critical challenge in achieving perceptually realistic reconstructions under rate constraints. Formulated within the randomized distributed function computation (RDFC) framework, we establish an achievable non-asymptotic RDP region, providing finite blocklength trade-offs between rate, distortion, and perceptual quality, aligning with semantic communication objectives. We extend this region to also include a secrecy constraint, providing strong secrecy guarantees against eavesdroppers via physical-layer security methods, ensuring resilience against quantum attacks. Our contributions include (i) establishing achievable bounds for non-asymptotic RDP regions under realism and distortion constraints; (ii) extending these bounds to provide strong secrecy guarantees; (iii) characterizing the asymptotic secure RDP region under a perfect realism constraint; and (iv) illustrating significant reductions in rates and the effects of secrecy constraints and finite blocklengths. Our results provide actionable insights for designing low-latency, high-fidelity, and secure image compression systems with realistic outputs, advancing applications, e.g., in privacy-critical domains.",

    "abstract": "Secure two-party computation (2PC) enables two parties to jointly evaluate a function while maintaining input privacy. Despite recent significant progress, a notable efficiency gap remains between actively secure and passively secure protocols. In S\\&P'12, Huang, Katz, and Evans formalized the notion of \\emph{active security with one-bit leakage}, providing a promising approach to bridging this gap. Protocols derived from this notion have become foundational in designing highly efficient actively secure 2PC protocols. However, a critical challenge identified by Huang, Katz, and Evans remains unexplored: these protocols face significant weaknesses in ensuring fairness for honest parties when employed in standalone settings rather than as components within larger protocols. While the authors proposed two potential solutions to mitigate this issue, both approaches are prohibitively expensive and lack formalization of security guarantees.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we first formally define an enhanced notion called \\emph{active security with one-bit-advantage bound}, in which the adversaries' advantages are strictly bounded to at most one bit beyond what honest parties obtain. This bound is enforced through a \\emph{progressive revelation} mechanism, where the evaluation result is disclosed incrementally bit by bit. In addition, we propose a novel approach leveraging label structures within garbled circuits to design a highly efficient constant-round 2PC protocol that achieves active security with one-bit advantage bound. Our protocol demonstrates \\emph{runtime performance nearly identical to that of passively secure garbled-circuit counterparts} in duplex networks (\\eg $1.033\\times$ for the {\\tt SHA256} circuit in LAN), with \\emph{low overhead} for output progressive revelation (only $80$ communicated bytes per bit release).\r\n\r\nWith its strengthened security guarantees and minimal overhead, our protocol is highly suitable for practical 2PC applications.",

    "abstract": "Weightwise degree-$d$ functions are Boolean functions that, on each set of fixed Hamming weight, coincide with a function of degree at most $d$. They generalize both symmetric functions and the Hidden Weight Bit Function (HWBF), which has been studied in cryptography for its favorable properties. \r\nIn this work, we establish a general upper bound on the algebraic immunity of such functions, a key security parameter against algebraic attacks on stream ciphers like filtered Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs). We construct explicit low-degree annihilators for WWdd functions with small $d$, and show how to generalize these constructions. As an application, we prove that the algebraic immunity of the HWBF is upper bounded by $3\\sqrt{n}$ disproving a result from 2011 that claimed a lower bound of $n/3$. We then apply our technique to several generalizations of the HWBF proposed since 2021 for homomorphically friendly constructions and LFSR-based ciphers, refining or refuting results from six prior works.",

    "abstract": "A set of unacquainted  parties, some of which may misbehave, communicate with each other over an unauthenticated and unreliable gossip network. They wish to jointly replicate a state machine $\\Pi$ so that each one of them has fair access to its operation. Specifically, assuming parties' computational power is measured as queries to an oracle machine $H(\\cdot)$, parties can issue symbols to the state machine in proportion to their queries to $H(\\cdot)$ at a given fixed rate. Moreover, if such access to the state machine is provided continuously in expected constant time installments we qualify it as fast fairness.\r\n\r\nA state machine replication (SMR) protocol in this permissionless setting is expected to offer consistency across parties and reliably process all symbols that honest parties wish to add to it in a timely manner despite  continuously fluctuating participation and in the presence of an adversary who commands less than half of the total queries to $H(\\cdot)$ per unit of time.\r\n\r\nA number of protocols strive to offer the above guarantee together with fast settlement  \u2014 notably, the Bitcoin blockchain offers a protocol that settles against Byzantine adversaries in polylogarithmic rounds, while fairness only holds in a fail-stop adversarial model (due to the fact that Byzantine behavior can bias access to the state machine in the adversary's favor). In this work, we put forth the first Byzantine-resilient protocol solving SMR in this setting with both expected-constant-time settlement and fast fairness. In addition, our protocol is self-sufficient in the sense of performing its own time keeping while tolerating an adaptively fluctuating set of parties.",

    "abstract": "Side-channel attacks consist of retrieving internal data from a victim system by analyzing its leakage, which usually requires proximity to the victim in the range of a few millimetres.\r\nScreaming channels are EM side channels transmitted at a distance of a few meters. \r\nThey appear on mixed-signal devices integrating an RF module on the same silicon die as the digital part.\r\nConsequently, the side channels are modulated by legitimate RF signal carriers and appear at the harmonics of the digital clock frequency.\r\nWhile initial works have only considered collecting leakage at these harmonics, late work has demonstrated that the leakage is also present at frequencies other than these harmonics.\r\nThis result significantly increases the number of available frequencies to perform a screaming-channel attack, which can be convenient in an environment where multiple harmonics are polluted.\r\nThis work studies how this diversity of frequencies carrying leakage can be used to improve attack performance.\r\nWe first study how to combine multiple frequencies.\r\nSecond, we demonstrate that frequency combination can improve attack performance and evaluate this improvement according to the performance of the combined frequencies.\r\nFinally, we demonstrate the interest of frequency combination in attacks at $15$ and, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, at $30$ meters. \r\nOne last important observation is that this frequency combination divides by $2$ the number of traces needed to reach a given attack performance.",

    "abstract": "Modern life makes having a digital identity no longer optional, whether one needs to manage a bank account or subscribe to a newspaper. As the number of online services increases, it is fundamental to safeguard user privacy and equip service providers (SP) with mechanisms enforcing Sybil resistance, i.e., preventing a single entity from showing as many. \r\n  Current approaches, such as anonymous credentials and self-sovereign identities, typically rely on identity providers or identity registries trusted not to track users' activities. However, this assumption of trust is no longer appropriate in a world where user data is considered a valuable asset. \r\n  To address this challenge, we introduce a new cryptographic notion, Anonymous Self-Credentials (ASC) along with two implementations. This approach enables users to maintain their privacy within an anonymity set while allowing SPs to obtain Sybil resistance. Then, we present a User-issued Unlinkable Single Sign-On (U2SSO) implemented from ASC that solely relies on an identity registry to immutably store identities. A U2SSO solution allows users to generate unlinkable child credentials for each SP using only one set of master credentials.\r\n  We demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of our U2SSO solution by providing a complete proof-of-concept.",

    "abstract": "eIDAS 2.0 (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services) is a very ambitious regulation aimed at equipping European citizens with a personal digital identity wallet (EU Digital Identity Wallet) on a mobile phone that not only needs to achieve a high level of security, but also needs to be available as soon as possible for a large number of citizens and respect their privacy (as per GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation).  \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce the foundations of a digital identity wallet solution that could help move closer to this objective by leveraging the proven anonymous credentials system BBS (Eurocrypt 2023), also known as BBS+, but modifying it to avoid the limitations that have hindered its widespread adoption, especially in certified infrastructures requiring trusted hardware implementation.  \r\nIn particular, the solution we propose, which we call BBS#, does not rely, contrary to BBS/BBS +, on bilinear maps and pairing-friendly curves (which are not supported by existing hardware) and only depends on the hardware implementation of well-known digital signature schemes such as ECDSA (ISO/IEC 14888-3) or ECSDSA (also known as ECSchnorr, ISO/IEC 14888-3) using classical elliptic curves. More precisely, BBS# can be rolled out without requiring any change in existing hardware or the algorithms that hardware supports. \r\nBBS# , which is proven secure in the random oracle model, retains the well-known security property (unforgeability of the credentials under the (gap) q-SDH assumption) and anonymity properties (multi-show full unlinkability and statistical anonymity of presentation proofs) of BBS/BBS+. \r\n\r\nBy implementing BBS# on several smartphones using different secure execution environments, we show that it is possible to achieve eIDAS 2.0 transactions which are not only efficient (around 70 ms on Android StrongBox), secure and certifiable at the highest level but also provide strong (optimal) privacy protection for all European ID Wallet users.",

    "abstract": "(Preprint) Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are rapidly gaining importance in privacy-preserving and verifiable computing. ZKPs enable a proving party to prove the truth of a statement to a verifying party without revealing anything else. ZKPs have applications in blockchain technologies, verifiable machine learning, and electronic voting, but have yet to see widespread adoption due to the computational complexity of the proving process.Recent works have accelerated the key primitives of state-of-the-art ZKP protocols on GPU and ASIC. However, the protocols accelerated thus far face one of two challenges: they either require a trusted setup for each application, or they generate larger proof sizes with higher verification costs, limiting their applicability in scenarios with numerous verifiers or strict verification time constraints. This work presents an accelerator, zkSpeed, for HyperPlonk, a state-of-the-art ZKP protocol that supports both one-time, universal setup and small proof sizes for typical ZKP applications in publicly verifiable, consensus-based systems. We accelerate the entire protocol, including two major primitives: SumCheck and Multi-scalar Multiplications (MSMs). We develop a full-chip architecture using 366.46 mm$^2$ and 2 TB/s of bandwidth to accelerate the entire proof generation process, achieving geometric mean speedups of 801$\\times$ over CPU baselines.",

    "abstract": "This work presents SPHINCSLET, the first fully standard-compliant and area-efficient hardware implementation of the SLH-DSA algorithm, formerly known as SPHINCS+, a post-quantum digital signature scheme. SPHINCSLET is designed to be parameterizable across different security levels and hash functions, offering a balanced trade-off between area efficiency and performance. Existing hardware implementations either feature a large area footprint to achieve fast signing and verification or adopt a coprocessor-based approach that significantly slows down these operations. SPHINCSLET addresses this gap by delivering a 4.7$\\times$ reduction in area compared to high-speed designs while achieving a 2.5$\\times$ to 5$\\times$ improvement in signing time over the most efficient coprocessor-based designs for a SHAKE256-based SPHINCS+ implementation. The SHAKE256-based SPHINCS+ FPGA implementation targeting the AMD Artix-7 requires fewer than 10.8K LUTs for any security level of SLH-DSA. Furthermore, the SHA-2-based SPHINCS+ implementation achieves a 2$\\times$ to 4$\\times$ speedup in signature generation across various security levels compared to existing SLH-DSA hardware, all while maintaining a compact area footprint of 6K to 15K LUTs. This makes it the fastest SHA-2-based SLH-DSA implementation to date. With an optimized balance of area and performance, SPHINCSLET can assist resource-constrained devices in transitioning to post-quantum cryptography.",

    "abstract": "Byzantine  Reliable  Broadcast  is  one of the most popular communication  primitives in distributed systems.  Byzantine reliable broadcast ensures that  processes agree to deliver  a  message  from  an initiator, even if some processes (possibly including the initiator) are Byzantine. In asynchronous settings, it is known since the prominent work of Bracha \\cite{Bracha87} that Byzantine  reliable  broadcast can be implemented deterministically if the total number of processes, denoted by $n$, satisfies $n \\geq 3t+1$ where $t$ is an upper bound on the number of Byzantine processes. Here, we study Byzantine Reliable Broadcast when processes are equipped with \\emph{trusted components}, special software or hardware designed to prevent equivocation. Our contribution is threefold. First, we show that, despite common belief, when each process is equipped with a trusted component, Bracha's algorithm still needs $n \\geq 3t+1$. Second, we present a novel algorithm that uses a single trusted component (at the initiator) that implements Byzantine Reliable  Asynchronous Broadcast with $n \\geq 2t+1$. \r\n\\yag{Lastly, building on our broadcast algorithm, we present TenderTee, a transformation of the Tendermint consensus algorithm by using trusted component, giving better Byzantine resilience. Tendertee works with $n \\geq 2t+1$, where Tendermint needed $n=3t+1$.}",

    "abstract": "Set reconciliation is a fundamental task in distributed systems, particularly in blockchain networks, where it enables the synchronization of transaction pools among peers and facilitates block dissemination. Existing traditional set reconciliation schemes are either statistical, providing success probability as a function of the communication overhead and the size of the symmetric difference, or require parametrization and estimation of the size of the symmetric difference, which can be prone to error. In this paper, we present CertainSync, a novel reconciliation framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to guarantee successful set reconciliation without any parametrization or estimators in use. The framework is rateless and adapts to the unknown symmetric difference size. The set reconciliation is guaranteed to be completed successfully whenever the communication overhead reaches a lower bound derived from the symmetric difference size and the universe size. Our framework is based on recent constructions of Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (IBLTs) ensuring successful element listing as long as the number of elements is bounded. We provide a theoretical analysis to prove the certainty in the set reconciliation for multiple constructions. The approach is also validated by simulations, showing the ability to synchronize sets with efficient communication costs while maintaining reconciliation guarantees compared to other baseline schemes for set reconciliation. To further improve communication overhead for large universes as blockchain networks, CertainSync is extended with a universe reduction technique to minimize communication overhead. We compare and validate the extended framework UniverseReduceSync against the basic CertainSync framework through simulations using real blockchain transaction hash data from the Ethereum blockchain network. The results illustrate a trade-off between improved communication costs and maintaining reconciliation guarantees without relying on parametrization or estimators, offering a comprehensive solution for set reconciliation in diverse scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Weyman and Zelevinsky generalised Vandermonde matrices to higher dimensions, which we call Vandermonde-Weyman-Zelevinsky tensors. \r\nWe generalise Lagrange interpolation to higher dimensions by devising a nearly linear time algorithm that given a Vandermonde-Weyman-Zelevinsky tensor and a sparse target vector, finds a tuple of vectors that hit the target under tensor evaluation. Tensor evaluation to us means evaluating the usual multilinear form associated with the tensor in all but one chosen dimension. Yet, this interpolation problem phrased with respect to a random tensor appears to be a hard multilinear system. Leveraging this dichotomy, we propose preimage sampleable trapdoor one-way functions in the spirit of Gentry-Peikert-Vaikuntanathan (GPV) lattice trapdoors. We design and analyse ``Hash-and-Sign'' digital signatures from such trapdoor one-way functions, yielding short signatures whose lengths scale nearly linearly in the security parameter. We also describe an encryption scheme.\r\n\r\nOur trapdoor is a random Vandermonde-Weyman-Zelevinsky tensor over a finite field and a random basis change. We hide the Vandermonde-Weyman-Zelevinsky tensor under the basis change and publish the resulting pseudorandom tensor. The one way function is the tensor evaluation derived from the public tensor, restricted so as to only map to sparse vectors.  We then design the domain sampler and preimage sampler demanded by the GPV framework. The former samples inputs that map to uniform images under the one-way function. The latter samples preimages given supplementary knowledge of the trapdoor. Preimage sampling is a randomised version of interpolation and knowing the basis change allows efficient translation between interpolation corresponding to the public and trapdoor tensors. An adversary seeking a preimage must solve a pseudorandom multilinear system, which seems cryptographically hard.",

    "abstract": "We propose an encrypted controller framework for linear time-invariant systems with actuator non-linearity based on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). While some existing works explore the use of partially homomorphic encryption (PHE) in implementing linear control systems, the impacts of the non-linear behaviors of the actuators on the systems are often left unconcerned. In particular, when the inputs to the controller become too small or too large, actuators may burn out due to unstable system state oscillations. To solve this dilemma, we design and implement FHECAP, an FHE-based controller framework that can homomorphically apply non-linear functions to the actuators to rectify the system inputs. In FHECAP, we first design a novel data encoding scheme tailored for efficient gain matrix evaluation. Then, we propose a high-precision homomorphic algorithm to apply non-arithmetic piecewise function to realize the actuator normalization. In the experiments, compared with the existing state-of-the-art encrypted controllers, FHECAP achieves $4\\times$--$1000\\times$ reduction in computational latency. We evaluate the effectiveness of FHECAP in the real-world application of encrypted control for spacecraft rendezvous. The simulation results show that the FHECAP achieves real-time spacecraft rendezvous with negligible accuracy loss.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing is regarded as one of the most significant upcoming advancements in computer science. \r\nAlthough fully operational quantum computers have yet to be realized, they are expected to solve specific problems that are difficult to solve using classical computers. \r\nGiven the limitations of quantum computing resources, it is crucial to design compact quantum circuits for core operations, such as quantum arithmetic.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we focus on optimizing the circuit depth of quantum multi-operand addition, which is a fundamental component in quantum implementations (as an example, SHA-2). \r\nBuilding on the foundational quantum carry-save approach by Phil Gossett, we introduce a tree-based quantum carry-save adder. \r\nOur design integrates the Wallace and Dadda trees to optimize carry handling during multi-operand additions. \r\nTo further reduce circuit depth, we utilize additional ancilla qubits for parallel operations and introduce an efficient technique for reusing these ancilla qubits.\r\n\r\nOur tree-based carry-save adder achieves the lowest circuit depth ($T$-depth) and provides an improvement of over 82% (up to 99%) in the qubit count\u2013circuit depth product for multi-operand addition. \r\nFurthermore, we apply our method to multiplication, achieving the lowest circuit depth and an improvement of up to 87% in the qubit count\u2013circuit depth product.",

    "abstract": "Group signatures allow a user to sign anonymously on behalf of a group of users while allowing a tracing authority to trace the signer's identity in case of misuse. In Chaum and van Heyst's original model (EUROCRYPT'91), the group needs to stay fixed. Throughout various attempts, including partially dynamic group signatures and revocations, Bootle et al. (ACNS'16, J. Cryptol.) formalized the notion of fully dynamic group signatures (FDGS), enabling both enrolling and revoking users of the group. However, in their scheme, the verification process needs to take into account the latest system information, and a previously generated signature will be invalidated as soon as, for example, there is a change in the group. We therefore raise a research question: Is it possible to construct an FDGS under which the validity of a signature can survive future changes in the system information?\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose Everlasting Fully Dynamic Group Signatures (EFDGS) that allow signers to generate signatures that do not require verification with any specific epoch. Specifically, once the signatures are created, they are valid forever. It also guarantees that the signer can only output such a signature when she is a valid user of the system. We realize the above new model by constructing a plausibly post-quantum standard-lattice-based EFDGS.",

    "abstract": "FALCON is a post-quantum signature selected by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Although its side-channel resilience has been studied and a masking countermeasure proposed, the division is a major performance bottleneck. This work proposes a different approach to the masked FALCON division. We use the Newton method and a convergent sequence to approximate this operation. The performance of the masked division is improved by a factor 6.7 for two shares and 6.98 for three shares. For the Gaussian sampler, the improvements are of a factor 1.45 for two shares and 1.43 for three shares. Formal security proofs using the MIMO-SNI criteria are also provided.",

    "abstract": "We introduce audience injection attacks, a novel class of vulnerabilities that impact widely used Web-based authentication and authorization protocols, including OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, FAPI, CIBA, the Device Authorization Grant, and various well-established extensions, such as Pushed Authorization Requests, Token Revocation, Token Introspection, and their numerous combinations.\r\nThese protocols underpin services for billions of users across diverse ecosystems worldwide, spanning low-risk applications like social logins to high-risk domains such as open banking, insurance, and healthcare.\r\n\r\nAudience injection attacks exploit a critical weakness in a core security mechanism of these protocols - the handling of so-called audiences in signature-based client authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows attackers to compromise fundamental security objectives whenever these mechanisms are utilized across two or more server endpoints. They enable the attacker to impersonate users and gain unauthorized access to their resources, even in high-security protocol families specifically designed for sensitive applications.\r\n\r\nWe responsibly disclosed these vulnerabilities to the relevant standardization bodies, which recognized their severity.\r\nIn collaboration with these organizations, we developed fixes and supported a coordinated response, leading to an ongoing effort to update a dozen of standards, numerous major implementations, and far-reaching ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The online realm has witnessed a surge in the buying and selling of data, prompting the emergence of dedicated data marketplaces. These platforms cater to servers (sellers), enabling them to set prices for access to their data, and clients (buyers), who can subsequently purchase these data, thereby streamlining and facilitating such transactions. However, the current data market is primarily confronted with the following issues. Firstly, they fail to protect client privacy, presupposing that clients submit their queries in plaintext. Secondly, these models are susceptible to being impacted by malicious client behavior, for example, enabling clients to potentially engage in arbitrage activities.\r\n\r\nTo address the aforementioned issues, we propose payable secure computation, a novel secure computation paradigm specifically designed for data pricing scenarios. It grants the server the ability to securely procure essential pricing information while protecting the privacy of client queries. Additionally, it fortifies the server's privacy against potential malicious client activities. As specific applications, we have devised customized payable protocols for two distinct secure computation scenarios: Keyword Private Information Retrieval (KPIR) and Private Set Intersection (PSI). \r\n\r\nWe implement our two payable protocols and compare them with the state-of-the-art related protocols that do not support pricing as a baseline. Since our payable protocols are more powerful in the data pricing setting, the experiment results show that they do not introduce much overhead over the baseline protocols. \r\nOur payable KPIR achieves the same online cost as baseline, while the setup is about $1.3-1.6\\times$ slower than it. Our payable PSI needs about $2\\times$ more communication cost than that of baseline protocol, while the runtime is $1.5-3.2\\times$ slower than it depending on the network setting.",

    "abstract": "The works of Garg et al. [S&P'24] (aka hinTS) and Das et al. [CCS'23] introduced the notion of silent threshold signatures (STS) - where a set of signers silently perform local computation to generate a public verification key. To sign a message, any set of $t$ signers sign the message non-interactively and these are aggregated into a constant-sized signature. This paradigm avoids performing expensive Distributed Key Generation procedure for each set of signers while keeping the public verification key constant-sized. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose the notion of committee-based silent threshold signature (c-STS) scheme. In a c-STS scheme, a set of signers initially perform a one-time setup to generate the verification key, and then a subset of signers are randomly chosen for an epoch to perform the threshold signing while the other signers are not authorized to sign during that epoch. This captures existing systems like Ethereum Altair and Dfinity where only a specific committee is authorized to sign in a designated epoch. The existing STS schemes cannot be extended to the committee setting because the signature verification only attests to the number of signing parties, not which committee they belong to.\r\n\r\nSo, we upgrade hinTS to the committee setting by proposing Dyna-hinTS. It is the $first$ c-STS scheme and it requires a one-time silent setup and generates a one-time public verification key that does not vary with the committee. Assuming a set of 1024 signers (with corrupt 682 signers), hinTS generates an aggregated signature in 1.7s whereas Dyna-hinTS generates it in $0.35$s within a committee of $80$ signers. This yields a $4.9\\times$ improvement over hinTS for signature generation at the cost of increasing signature verification time by $4\\%$ over hinTS. Dyna-hinTS supports general access structure, weighted signatures and improves existing multiverse threshold signatures.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present an improved framework for proving query bounds in the Quantum Random Oracle Model (QROM) for algorithms with both quantum and classical query interfaces, where the classical input is partially controlled by the adversary. By extending existing techniques, we develop a method to bound the progress an adversary can make with such partial-control classical queries. While this framework is applicable to different hash function properties, we decided to demonstrate the impact of the new techniques by giving an analysis of the multi-target extended target collision resistance property (m-eTCR). This new approach allows us to achieve an improved bound that significantly reduces the required function key size. Our proof is tight in terms of query complexity and has significant implications for cryptographic applications, especially for signature schemes in the hash & sign paradigm, enabling more efficient instantiations with reduced salt sizes and smaller signature lengths. For an example of multiple signatures aggregation, we achieve a signature size of 30 kB smaller.",

We also incorporate boolean logic gates of types XOR, NOT-Shift and Permutation which get applied to the light ray after each interaction with a reflecting or refracting polynomial curve. This alternating interaction between Optical gates (polynomial curves) and Non-optical gates creates a complex and secure cryptographic system.

    "abstract": "The YOSO (You Only Speak Once) model, introduced by Gentry et al. (CRYPTO 2021), helps to achieve strong security guarantees in cryptographic protocols for  distributed settings, like blockchains, with large number of parties. YOSO protocols typically employ smaller anonymous committees to execute individual rounds of the protocol instead of having all parties execute the entire protocol. After completing their tasks, parties encrypt protocol messages for the next anonymous committee and erase their internal state before publishing ciphertexts, thereby enhancing security in dynamically changing environments.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we consider the problem of secure multi-party computation (MPC), a fundamental problem in cryptography and distributed computing. We assume honest majority among the committee members, and work in the online-offline, i.e., preprocessing, setting.\r\n   In this context, we present the first YOSO MPC protocol where efficiency---measured as communication complexity---improves as the number of parties increases. Specifically, for $0<\\epsilon<1/2$ and an adversary corrupting $t<n(\\frac{1}{2}-\\epsilon)$ out of $n$ parties, our MPC protocol exhibits enhanced scalability as $n$ increases, where the online phase communication becomes independent of $n$.\r\n   Prior YOSO MPC protocols considered $t$ as large as $(n-1)/2$, but a significant hurdle persisted in obtaining YOSO MPC with communication that does not scale linearly with the number of committee members, a challenge that is exagerbated when the committee size was large per YOSO's requirements.\r\n   We show that, by considering a small ``gap'' of $\\epsilon>0$, the sizes of the committees are only marginally increased, while online communication is significantly reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we explicitly consider fail-stop adversaries, i.e., honest participants who may inadvertently fail due to reasons such as denial of service or software/hardware errors. In prior YOSO work, these adversaries were grouped with fully malicious parties. Adding explicit support for them allows us to achieve even better scalability.",

    "abstract": "SAND is an AND-RX-based lightweight block cipher proposed by Chen et al. There are two variants of SAND, namely SAND-64 and SAND-128, due to structural differences. In this paper, we search for impossible differential distinguishers of SAND-64 using the Constraint Programming (CP) and reveal 56 types of impossible differential distinguishers up to 11 rounds. Furthermore, we demonstrate a key recovery attack on 17-round SAND-64. The complexities for the attack require $2^{56}$ data, $2^{127}$ encryptions, and $2^{60}$ bytes of memory, respectively. Although this result currently achieves the best attack on round-reduced SAND-64, this attack does not threaten the security of SAND-64 against impossible differential attack.",

    "abstract": "When Nakamoto invented Bitcoin, the first generation of cryptocurrencies followed it in applying POW (Proof of Work) consensus mechanism; due to its excessive energy consumption and heavy carbon footprints, new innovations evolved like Proof of Space, POS (Proof of Stake), and a lot more with many variants for each. Furthermore, the emergence of more blockchain applications and kinds beyond just cryptocurrencies needed more consensus mechanisms that is optimized to fit requirements of each application or blockchain kind; examples range from IoT (Internet of Things) blockchains for sustainability applications that often use variants of BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) algorithm, and consensus needed to relay transactions and/or assets between different blockchains in interoperability solutions. Previous studies concentrated on surveying and/or proposing different blockchain consensus rules, on a specific consensus issue like attacks, randomization, or on deriving theoretical results. Starting from discussing most important theoretical results, this paper tries to gather and organize all significant existing material about consensus in the blockchain world explaining design challenges, tradeoffs and research areas. We realize that the topic could fit for a complete textbook, so we summarize the basic concepts and support with tables and appendices. Then we highlight some case examples from interoperability solutions to show how flexible and wide the design space is to fit both general and special purpose systems. The aim is to provide researchers with a comprehensive overview of the topic, along with the links to go deeper into every detail.",

    "abstract": "A threshold signature scheme allows distributing a signing key to $n$ users, such that any $t$ of them can jointly sign, but any $t-1$ cannot. It is desirable to prove \\emph{adaptive security} of threshold signature schemes, which considers adversaries that can adaptively corrupt honest users even after interacting with them. For a class of signatures that relies on security proofs with rewinding, such as Schnorr signatures, proving adaptive security entails significant challenges.\r\n\r\nThis work proposes two threshold signature schemes that are provably adaptively secure with rewinding proofs. Our proofs are solely in the random oracle model (ROM), without relying on the algebraic group model (AGM).\r\n\r\n- We give a 3-round scheme based on the algebraic one-more discrete logarithm (AOMDL) assumption. The scheme outputs a standard Schnorr signature.\r\n\r\n- We give a 2-round scheme based on the DL assumption. Signatures output by the scheme contain one more scalar than a Schnorr signature.\r\n\r\nWe follow the recent work by Katsumata, Reichle, and Takemure (Crypto 2024) that proposed the first threshold signature scheme with a rewinding proof of full adaptive security. Their scheme is a 5-round threshold Schnorr scheme based on the DL assumption. Our results significantly improve the round complexity.\r\n\r\nKatsumata et al.'s protocol can be viewed as applying a masking technique to Sparkle, a threshold Schnorr signature scheme by Crites, Komlo, and Maller (Crypto 2023). This work shows wider applications of the masking technique. Our first scheme is obtained by masking FROST, a threshold Schnorr protocol by Komlo and Goldberg (SAC 2020). The second scheme is obtained by masking a threshold version of HBMS, a multi-signature scheme by Bellare and Dai (Asiacrypt 2021).\r\n\r\nKatsumata et al. masked Sparkle at the cost of 2 additional rounds. Our main insight is that this cost varies across schemes, especially depending on how to simulate signing in the security proofs. The cost is 1 extra round for our first scheme, and is 0 for our second scheme.",

    "abstract": "Typical protocols in the multi-party private set operations (MPSO) setting enable $m > 2$ parties to perform certain secure computation on the intersection or union of their private sets, realizing a very limited range of MPSO functionalities. Most works in this field focus on just one or two specific functionalities, resulting in a large variety of isolated schemes and a lack of a unified framework in MPSO research. In this work, we present an MPSO framework, which allows $m$ parties, each holding a set, to securely compute any set formulas (arbitrary compositions of a finite number of binary set operations, including intersection, union and difference) on their private sets. Our framework is highly versatile and can be instantiated to accommodate a broad spectrum of MPSO functionalities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework to achieve such a level of flexibility and generality in MPSO, without relying on generic secure multi-party computation (MPC) techniques.\r\n\r\nOur framework exhibits favorable theoretical and practical performance. The computation and communication complexity scale linearly with the set size $n$, and it achieves optimal complexity that is on par with the naive solution for widely used functionalities, such as multi-party private set intersection (MPSI), MPSI with cardinality output (MPSI-card), and MPSI with cardinality and sum (MPSI-card-sum), in the standard semi-honest model. Furthermore, the instantiations of our framework mainly from symmetric-key techniques yield efficient protocols for MPSI, MPSI-card, MPSI-card-sum, and multi-party private set union (MPSU), with online performance surpassing or matching the state of the art.\r\n\r\nAt the technical core of our framework is a newly introduced primitive called predicative zero-sharing. This primitive captures the universality of a number of MPC protocols and is composable. We believe it may be of independent interest.",

To minimize its on-chain footprint, the protocol utilizes the OP_RETURN mechanism for ownership records, while complementary NFT-related actions are stored on the LAOS blockchain.

    "abstract": "We prove the first meta-complexity characterization of a quantum cryptographic primitive. We show that one-way puzzles exist if and only if there is some quantum samplable distribution  of binary strings over which it is hard to approximate Kolmogorov complexity. Therefore, we characterize one-way puzzles by the average-case hardness of a uncomputable problem. This brings to the quantum setting a recent line of work that characterizes classical cryptography with the average-case hardness of a meta-complexity problem, initiated by Liu and Pass. Moreover, since the average-case hardness of Kolmogorov complexity over classically polynomial-time samplable distributions characterizes one-way functions, this result poses one-way puzzles as a natural generalization  of one-way functions to the quantum setting. Furthermore, our equivalence  goes through probability estimation, giving us the additional equivalence that one-way puzzles exist if and only if there is a quantum samplable distribution over which probability estimation is hard.  We also observe that  the oracle worlds of defined by Kretschmer et. al. rule out any relativizing characterization of  one-way puzzles by the hardness of a problem in $\\mathbf{NP}$ or $\\mathbf{QMA}$, which means that  it may not be possible with current techniques to characterize one-way puzzles with another meta-complexity problem.",

    "abstract": "Well-trained deep neural networks (DNN), including large\r\nlanguage models (LLM), are valuable intellectual property assets. To defend against model extraction attacks, one of the major ideas proposed in a large body of previous research is obfuscation: splitting the original DNN and storing the components separately. However, systematically analyzing the methods\u2019 security against various attacks and optimizing the efficiency of defenses are still challenging. In this paper, We propose a taxonomy of model-based extraction attacks, which enables us to identify vulnerabilities of several existing obfuscation methods. We also propose an extremely efficient model obfuscation method called O2Splitter using trusted execution environment (TEE). The secrets we store in TEE have O(1)-size, i.e., independent of model size. Although O2Splitter relies on a pseudo-random function to provide a quantifiable guarantee for protection and noise compression, it does not need any complicated training or filtering of the weights. Our comprehensive experiments show that O2Splitter can mitigate norm-clipping and fine-tuning attacks. Even for\r\nsmall noise (\u03f5 = 50), the accuracy of the obfuscated model is close to\r\nrandom guess, and the tested attacks cannot extract a model with comparable accuracy. In addition, the empirical results also shed light on discovering the relation between DP parameters in obfuscation and the risks of concrete extraction attacks.",

    "abstract": "Screaming-channel attacks enable Electromagnetic (EM) Side-Channel Attacks (SCAs) at larger distances due to higher EM leakage energies than traditional SCAs, relaxing the requirement of close access to the victim. This attack can be mounted on devices integrating Radio Frequency (RF) modules on the same die as digital circuits, where the RF can unintentionally capture, modulate, amplify, and transmit the leakage along with legitimate signals. Leakage results from digital switching activity, so the hypothesis of previous works was that this leakage would appear at multiples of the digital clock frequency, i.e., harmonics. This work demonstrates that compromising signals appear not only at the harmonics and that leakage at non-harmonics can be exploited for successful attacks. Indeed, the transformations undergone by the leaked signal are complex due to propagation effects through the substrate and power and ground planes, so the leakage also appears at other frequencies. We first propose two methodologies to locate frequencies that contain leakage and demonstrate that it appears at non-harmonic frequencies. Then, our experimental results show that screaming-channel attacks at non-harmonic frequencies can be as successful as at harmonics when retrieving a 16-byte AES key. As the RF spectrum is polluted by interfering signals, we run experiments and show successful attacks in a more realistic, noisy environment where harmonic frequencies are contaminated by multi-path fading and interference. These attacks at non-harmonic frequencies increase the attack surface by providing attackers with an increased number of potential frequencies where attacks can succeed.",

    "abstract": "The scalability of modern decentralized blockchain systems is constrained by the requirement that the participating nodes execute the entire chains transactions without the ability to delegate the verification workload across multiple actors trustlessly. This is further limited by the need for sequential transaction execution and repeated block validation, where each node must re-execute all transactions before accepting blocks, also leading to delayed broadcasting in many architectures.\r\n\r\nConsequently, throughput is limited by the capacity of individual nodes, significantly preventing scalability.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce GIGA, a SNARK-based protocol that enables trustless parallel execution of transactions, processing non-conflicting operations concurrently, while preserving security guarantees and state consistency. The protocol organizes transactions into non-conflicting batches which are executed and proven in parallel, distributing execution across multiple decentralized entities. These batch proofs are recursively aggregated into a single succinct proof that validates the entire block.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the protocol both distributes the execution workload and removes redundant re-execution from the network, significantly improving blockchain throughput while not affecting decentralization.\r\n\r\nPerformance estimates demonstrate that, under the same system assumptions (e.g., consensus, networking, and virtual machine architecture) and under high degrees of transaction parallelism (i.e., when most transactions operate on disjoint parts of the state), our protocol may achieve over a 10000x throughput improvement compared to popular blockchain architectures that use sequential execution models, and over a 500x improvement compared to blockchain architectures employing intra-node parallelization schemes. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, our protocol enables a significant increase in transaction computational complexity, unlocking a wide range of use cases that were previously unfeasible on traditional blockchain architectures due to the limited on-chain computational capacity.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we propose a reward mechanism that ensures the economic sustainability of the proving network, dynamically adjusting to computational demand while fostering competition among provers based on cost-efficiency and reliability.",

    "abstract": "Private information retrieval (PIR) allows to privately read a chosen bit from an $N$-bit database $x$ with $o(N)$ bits of communication. Lin, Mook, and Wichs (STOC 2023) showed that by preprocessing $x$ into an encoded database $\\hat x$, it suffices to access only $polylog(N)$ bits of $\\hat x$ per query. This requires $|\\hat x|\\ge N\\cdot polylog(N)$, and prohibitively large server circuit size.\r\n\r\nWe consider an alternative preprocessing model (Boyle et al. and Canetti et al., TCC 2017), where the encoding $\\hat x$ depends on a client's short secret key. In this secret-key PIR (sk-PIR) model we construct a protocol with $O(N^\\epsilon)$ communication, for any constant $\\epsilon>0$, from the Learning Parity with Noise assumption in a parameter regime not known to imply public-key encryption. This is evidence against public-key encryption being necessary for sk-PIR.\r\n\r\nUnder a new conjecture related to the hardness of learning a hidden linear subspace of $\\mathbb{F}_2^n$ with noise, we construct sk-PIR with similar communication and encoding size $|\\hat x|=(1+\\epsilon)\\cdot N$ in which the server is implemented by a Boolean circuit of size $(4+\\epsilon)\\cdot N$. This is the first candidate PIR scheme with such a circuit complexity.",

    "abstract": "In Hamming Quasi-Cyclic (HQC), one of the finalists in the NIST competition for the standardization of post-quantum cryptography, decryption relies on decoding a noisy codeword through a public error-correcting code. The noise vector has a special form that depends on the secret key (a pair of sparse polynomials). However, the decoder, which is currently employed in HQC, is agnostic to the secret key, operating under the assumption that the error arises from a Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). In this paper, we demonstrate that this special noise structure can instead be leveraged to develop more powerful decoding strategies.\r\n\r\nWe first study the problem from a coding-theoretic perspective. The current code design, which admits a non-zero decryption failure rate, is close to optimal in the setting of a decoder that is agnostic to the error structure. We show that there are code-decoder pairs with a considerably shorter code length that can guarantee unique decoding by taking the error structure into account. This result is non-constructive, i.e., we do not provide an explicit code construction and it remains open whether efficient decoding is possible. Nevertheless, it highlights the potential that can be tapped by taking the error structure into account.\r\nWe then argue that, in practice, the matter of decoding in HQC can be related to solving an instance of the noisy syndrome decoding problem, in which the parity-check matrix is constituted by the polynomials in the secret key. We show that, using decoders for Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) and Moderate-Density Parity-Check (MDPC) codes, one can significantly reduce the entity of the noise and, de facto, also the Decoding Failure Rate (DFR) of the HQC decoder. \r\n\r\nThis preliminary study leaves some open questions and problems. While it shows that decoding in HQC can be improved, the modeling of the DFR gets more complicated: even for the basic decoder we propose in this paper, we have not been able to devise a reliable DFR model. This is likely due to the fact that the decoder structure resembles the iterative nature of LDPC/MDPC decoders, for which devising a reliable DFR estimation is a well-known difficult problem.",

    "abstract": "Asynchronous Complete Secret Sharing (ACSS) is a foundational module for asynchronous networks, playing a critical role in cryptography. It is essential for Asynchronous Secure Multi-Party Computation (AMPC) and, with termination, is widely applied in Validated Asynchronous Byzantine Agreement (VABA) and Asynchronous Distributed Key Generation (ADKG) to support secure distributed systems.\r\nCurrently, there are relatively few statistical secure ACSS protocols that can guarantee termination, and their communication complexity is relatively high. To reduce communication complexity, we propose a new multi-receiver signature scheme, ARICP, which supports linear operations on signatures. Leveraging the ARICP scheme and the properties of symmetric polynomials, we propose an ACSS protocol that ensures termination and optimal resilience ($t < n / 3$) with $\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}\\kappa$) bits per sharing. Compared with the best-known result of ACSS protocols that guarantee termination [CP23], the amortized communication complexity of our protocol is reduced by a factor of $\\mathcal{O}(n)$.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Dupin and Abelard proposed a broadcast encryption scheme which outperforms the Complete Subtree-based and Subset Difference broadcast encryption in terms of encryption cost and bandwidth requirement. However, Dupin and Abelard acknowledge that the worst-case bound for bandwidth requirement of Complete Subtree approach can be reached in their scheme as well. In this paper, we answer the call to further reduce this bandwidth bottleneck. We first provide concrete analysis to show how this worst-case upper-bound is reached from concrete Boolean functions. Then we present two improved broadcast encryption schemes to significantly reduce this worst-case bandwidth consumption for further optimization of Dupin and Abelard\u2019s technique. Our proposed approach ADC-BE, composed of two algorithms, AD-BE and AC-BE, can significantly optimize this worst-case complexity from n/2 down to 1 for a system of n users. This is efficient especially for large number of users in the system. Our proposed schemes combines the algebraic normal form, disjunctive normal form, and conjunctive normal form to optimize a Boolean function to its minimized representation. In addition, our approaches can be made secure against quantum adversaries and are therefore post-quantum, where both algorithms AD-BE and AC-BE require minimal assumptions based on existence of one-way function.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new bootstrapping equation for the CKKS homomorphic encryption scheme of approximate numbers. The original bootstrapping approach for CKKS consists in homomorphically evaluating a polynomial that approximates the modular reduction modulo q. In contrast, our new bootstrapping equation directly embeds the additive group modulo q into the complex roots of unity, which can be evaluated natively in the CKKS scheme. Due to its reduced multiplicative depth, our new bootstrapping equation achieves a 7x latency improvement for a single slot compared to the original CKKS bootstrapping, though it scales less efficiently when applied to a larger number of slots.",

    "abstract": "As real-world networks such as social networks and computer networks are often complex and distributed, modeling them as multilayer graphs is gaining popularity. For instance, when studying social interactions across platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, TikTok, and Bluesky, users may be connected on several of these platforms. To identify important nodes/users, the platforms might wish to analyze user interactions using, e.g., centrality measures when accounting for connections across all platforms. That raises the challenge for platforms to perform such computation while simultaneously protecting their user data to shelter their own business as well as uphold data protection laws. This necessitates designing solutions that allow for performing secure\r\ncomputation on a multilayer graph which is distributed among mutually distrusting parties while keeping each party's data hidden.\r\n\r\nThe work of Asharov et al. (WWW'17) addresses this problem by designing secure solutions for centrality measures that involve computing the truncated Katz score and reach score on multilayer graphs. However, we identify several limitations in that work which render the solution inefficient or even unfeasible for realistic networks with significantly more than 10k nodes. We address these limitations by designing secure solutions that are significantly more efficient and scalable. In more detail, given that real-world graphs are known to be sparse, our solutions move away from an expensive matrix-based representation to a more efficient list-based representation. We design novel, secure, and efficient solutions for computing centrality measures and prove their correctness. Our solutions drastically reduce the asymptotic complexity from the prohibitive $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathsf{V}|^2)$ even for the fastest solution by Asharov et al. down to $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathsf{V}|\\log |\\mathsf{V}|)$, for $|\\mathsf{V}|$ nodes. To design our solutions, we extend upon the secure graph computation framework of Koti et al. (CCS'24), providing a novel framework with improved capabilities in multiple directions. Finally, we provide an end-to-end implementation of our secure graph analysis framework and establish concrete efficiency improvements over prior work, observing several orders of magnitude improvement.",

    "abstract": "The increased popularity of large language models (LLMs) raises serious privacy concerns, where users' private queries are sent to untrusted servers. Many cryptographic techniques have been proposed to provide privacy, such as secure multiparty computation (MPC), which enables the evaluation of LLMs directly on private data. However, cryptographic techniques have been deemed impractical as they introduce large communication and computation. On the other hand, many obfuscation techniques have been proposed, such as split inference, where part of the model is evaluated on edge devices to hide the input data from untrusted servers, but these methods provide limited privacy guarantees.\r\n\r\nWe propose Fission, a privacy-preserving framework that improves latency while providing strong privacy guarantees. Fission utilizes an MPC network for linear computations, while nonlinearities are computed on a separate evaluator network that receives shuffled values in the clear and returns nonlinear functions evaluated at these values back to the MPC network. As a result, each evaluator only gets access to parts of the shuffled data, while the model weights remain private. We evaluate fission on a wide set of LLMs and compare it against prior works. Fission results in up to eight times faster inference and eight times reduced bandwidth compared to prior works while retaining high accuracy. Finally, we construct an attack on obfuscation techniques from related works that show significant information leakage, and we demonstrate how Fission enhances privacy.",

Contrary to what has been suggested by previous works, our investigation shows that, when paired with modern deep learning architectures, appropriate pre-processing and normalization techniques; it can perform as well as the popular identity labelling functions and sometimes even beat it. In fact, we hereby introduce a new machine learning method, dubbed, that helps solve the class imbalance problem associated to HW, while significantly improving the performance of unprofiled attacks. We additionally release our new, easy to use python package that we used in our experiments, implementing a broad variety of machine learning driven side channel attacks as open source, along with a new dataset AES_nRF, acquired on the nRF52840 SoC.",

    "abstract": "Proxy re-encryption (PRE) schemes enable a semi-honest proxy to transform a ciphertext of one user $i$ to another user $j$ while preserving the privacy of the underlying message. Multi-hop PRE schemes allow a legal ciphertext to undergo multiple transformations, but for lattice-based multi-hop PREs, the number of transformations is typically bounded due to the increase of error terms. Recently, Zhao et al. (Esorics 2024) introduced a lattice-based unbounded multi-hop (homomorphic) PRE scheme that supports an unbounded number of hops. Nevertheless, their scheme only achieves the selective CPA security. In contrast, Fuchsbauer et al. (PKC 2019) proposed a generic framework for constructing HRA-secure unbounded multi-hop PRE schemes from FHE. Despite this, when instantiated with state-of-the-art FHEW-like schemes, the overall key size and efficiency remain unsatisfactory. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present a lattice-based unbounded multi-hop PRE scheme with the stronger adaptive HRA security (i.e. security against honest re-encryption attacks), which is more suitable for practical applications. Our scheme features an optimized re-encryption process based on the FHEW-like blind rotation, which resolves the incompatibility between the noise flooding technique and Fuchsbauer et al. 's framework when instantiated with FHEW-like schemes. This results in reduced storage requirements for public keys and offers higher efficiency. Moreover, our optimized unbounded multi-hop PRE scheme can be modified to an unbounded homomorphic PRE, a scheme allowing for arbitrary homomorphic computations over fresh, re-encrypted, and evaluated ciphertexts.",

    "abstract": "Key derivation functions (KDFs) are integral to many cryptographic protocols. Their functionality is to turn raw key material, such as a Diffie-Hellman secret, into a strong cryptographic key that is indistinguishable from random. This guarantee was formalized by Krawczyk together with the seminal introduction of HKDF (CRYPTO 2010), in a model where the KDF only takes a single key material input. Modern protocol designs, however, regularly need to combine multiple secrets, possibly even from different sources, with the guarantee that the derived key is secure as long as at least one of the inputs is good. This is particularly relevant in settings like hybrid key exchange for quantum-safe migration. Krawczyk's KDF formalism does not capture this goal, and there has been surprisingly little work on the security considerations for KDFs since then.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we thus revisit the syntax and security model for KDFs to treat multiple, possibly correlated inputs. Our syntax is assertive: We do away with salts, which are needed in theory to extract from arbitrary sources in the standard model, but in practice, they are almost never used (or even available) and sometimes even misused, as we argue. We use our new model to analyze real-world multi-input KDFs\u2014in Signal's X3DH protocol, ETSI's TS 103 744 standard, and MLS' combiner for pre-shared keys\u2014as well as new constructions we introduce for specialized settings\u2014e.g., a purely blockcipher-based one. We further discuss the importance of collision resistance for KDFs and finally apply our multi-input KDF model to show how hybrid KEM key exchange can be analyzed from a KDF perspective.",

The en-\r\ncryption schemes upon which traditional mixnets are built, as well as the\r\nzero-knowledge proofs used to provide verifiability, will, however, soon\r\nbecome insecure once a cryptographically-relevant quantum computer is\r\nbuilt. In this work, we construct the most compact verifiable mixnet that\r\nachieves privacy and verifiability through encryption and zero-knowledge\r\nproofs based on the hardness of lattice problems, which are believed to\r\nbe quantum-safe.\r\n\r\nA core component of verifiable mixnets is a proof of shuffle. The starting\r\npoint for our construction is the proof of shuffle of Aranha et al. (CT-\r\nRSA 2021). We first identify an issue with the soundness proof in that\r\nwork, which is also present in the adaptation of this proof in the mixnets\r\nof Aranha et al. (ACM CCS 2023) and Hough et al. (IACR CiC 2025).\r\nThe issue is that one cannot directly adapt classical proofs of shuffle\r\nto the lattice setting due to the splitting structure of the rings used in\r\nlattice-based cryptography. This is not just an artifact of the proof, but\r\na problem that manifests itself in practice, and we successfully mount an\r\nattack against the implementation of the first of the mixnets. We fix the\r\nproblem and introduce a general approach for proving shuffles in split-\r\nting rings that can be of independent interest.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency improvement of our mixnet over prior work is achieved by\r\nswitching from re-encryption mixnets (as in the works of Aranha et al.\r\nand Hough et al.) to decryption mixnets with very efficient layering based\r\non the hardness of the LWE and LWR problems over polynomial rings.\r\nThe ciphertexts in our scheme are smaller by approximately a factor of\r\n10X and 2X over the aforementioned instantiations, while the linear-size\r\nzero-knowledge proofs are smaller by a factor of 4X and 2X.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\u2014Anonymous token schemes are cryptographic\r\nprotocols for limiting the access to online resources to\r\ncredible users. The resource provider issues a set of access\r\ntokens to the credible user that they can later redeem\r\nanonymously, i.e., without the provider being able to link\r\ntheir redemptions. When combined with credibility tests such\r\nas CAPTCHAs, anonymous token schemes can significantly\r\nincrease user experience and provider security, without\r\nexposing user access patterns to providers.\r\nCurrent anonymous token schemes such as the Privacy\r\nPass protocol by Davidson et al. rely on oblivious\r\npseudorandom functions (OPRFs), which let server and user\r\njointly compute randomly looking access tokens. For those\r\nprotocols, token issuing costs are linear in the number of\r\nrequested tokens.\r\nIn this work, we propose a new approach for building\r\nanonymous token schemes. Instead of relying on two-party\r\ncomputation to realize a privacy-preserving pseudorandom\r\nfunction evaluation, we propose to offload token generation\r\nto the user by using group verifiable random functions\r\n(GVRFs). GVRFs are a new cryptographic primitive\r\nthat allow users to produce verifiable pseudorandomness.\r\nOpposed to standard VRFs, verification is anonymous within\r\nthe group of credible users. We give a construction of group\r\nVRFs from the Dodis-Yampolskiy VRF and Equivalence-\r\nClass Signatures, based on pairings and a new Diffie-\r\nHellman inversion assumption that we analyze in the Generic\r\nGroup Model. Our construction enjoys compact public keys\r\nand proofs, while evaluation and verification costs are only\r\nslightly increased compared to the Dodis-Yampolskiy VRF.\r\nBy deploying a group VRF instead of a OPRF, we\r\nobtain an anonymous token scheme where communication\r\nas well as server-side computation during the issuing phase\r\nis constant and independent of the number of tokens a\r\nuser requests. Moreover, by means of our new concept of updatable token policies, the number of unspent tokens in\r\ncirculation can retrospectively (i.e., even after the credibility\r\ncheck) be decreased or increased in order to react to\r\nthe current or expected network situation. Our tokens are\r\nfurther countable and publicly verifiable. This comes at the\r\ncost of higher computational efforts for token redemption\r\nand verification as well as somewhat weaker unlinkability\r\nguarantees compared to Privacy Pass.",

    "abstract": "Whilst many key exchange and digital signature methods use the NIST P256 (secp256r1) and secp256k1 curves, there is often a demand for increased security. With these curves, we have a 128-bit security. These security levels can be increased to 256-bit security with  NIST P-521  Curve 448  and Brainpool-P512. This paper outlines a new curve - Eccfrog512ck2 - and which provides 256-bit security and enhanced performance over NIST P-521. Along with this, it has side-channel resistance and is designed to avoid weaknesses such as related to the MOV attack. It shows that Eccfrog512ck2 can have a 61.5% speed-up on scalar multiplication and a 33.3% speed-up on point generation over the NIST P-521 curve.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed communication, yet their role in secure messaging remains underexplored, especially in surveillance-heavy environments. At the same time, many governments all over the world are proposing legislation to detect, backdoor, or even ban encrypted communication. That emphasizes the need for alternative ways to communicate securely and covertly over open channels. We propose a novel cryptographic embedding framework that enables covert Public Key or Symmetric Key encrypted communication over public chat channels with human-like produced texts. Some unique properties of our framework are: 1. It is LLM agnostic, i.e., it allows participants to use different local LLM models independently; 2. It is pre- or post-quantum agnostic; 3. It ensures indistinguishability from human-like chat-produced texts. Thus, it offers a viable alternative where traditional encryption is detectable and restricted.",

    "abstract": "Can a dealer share a secret without knowing the shareholders? We provide a positive answer to this question by introducing the concept of an attribute-based secret sharing (AB-SS) scheme. With AB-SS, a dealer can distribute a secret based on attributes rather than specific individuals or shareholders. Only authorized users whose attributes satisfy a given access structure can recover the secret. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of attribute-based publicly verifiable secret sharing (AB-PVSS). An AB-PVSS scheme allows external users to verify the correctness of all broadcast messages from the dealer and shareholders, similar to a traditional PVSS scheme. Additionally, AB-SS (or AB-PVSS) distinguishes itself from traditional SS (or PVSS) by enabling a dealer to generate shares according to an arbitrary monotone access structure. To construct an AB-PVSS scheme, we first implement a decentralized ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) scheme. The proposed CP-ABE scheme offers a smaller ciphertext size and requires fewer computational operations, although it is not fully-fledged as a trade-off. We then incorporate non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proofs to enable public verification of the CP-ABE ciphertext. Based on the CP-ABE and NIZK proofs, we construct an AB-PVSS primitive. Furthermore, we present an intuitive implementation of optimistic fair exchange based on the AB-PVSS scheme. Finally, we conduct security analysis and comprehensive experiments on the proposed CP-ABE and AB-PVSS schemes. The results demonstrate that both schemes exhibit plausible performance compared to related works.",

    "abstract": "We consider adversaries able to perform a nonzero but small number of discrete logarithm computations, as would be expected with near-term quantum computers. Schemes with public parameters consisting of a few group elements are now at risk; could an adversary knowing the discrete logarithms of these elements go on to easily compromise the security of many users? We study this question for known schemes and find, across them, a perhaps surprising variance in the answers. In a first class are schemes, including Okamoto and Katz-Wang signatures, that we show fully retain security even when the discrete logs of the group elements in their parameters are known to the adversary. In a second class are schemes like Cramer-Shoup encryption and the SPAKE2 password-authenticated key exchange protocol that we show retain some partial but still meaningful and valuable security. In the last class are schemes we show by attack to totally break. The distinctions uncovered by these results shed light on the security of classical schemes in a setting of immediate importance, and help make choices moving forward.",

    "abstract": "Generalized secret sharing (GSS), which accommodates monotone access structures, has been under-explored in distributed computing over the past decades. In this paper, we propose the publicly verifiable generalized secret sharing (PVGSS) scheme, enhancing the applicability of GSS in transparent systems. PVGSS not only enables a dealer to share a secret with fine-grained access structures, but also allows anyone to verify whether the dealer and shareholders are acting honestly or not. We begin by introducing two approaches to implement GSS schemes: one based on recursive Shamir secret sharing and another utilizing linear secret sharing scheme (LSSS). Then, we present PVGSS constructions by integrating non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs into the GSS schemes. Further, we prove that the proposed PVGSS schemes achieve IND1-secrecy under DDH assumption. To showcase the practical applicability of PVGSS schemes, we implement a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol that enables fair atomic swaps of ERC-20 tokens. A sophisticated access structure is devised to: (1) enable fair atomic swaps during normal protocol execution, and (2) incorporate fault-tolerant passive watchers to provide accountable arbitration when disputes occur. Our benchmarks on the BN128 curve demonstrate the computational efficiency of PVGSS schemes, while Ethereum gas cost analysis confirms the viability of the DEX implementation.",

    "abstract": "A proof of reserves (PoR) protocol enables a cryptocurrency exchange to prove to its users that it owns a certain amount of coins, as a first step towards proving that it is solvent. We present the design, implementation, and security analysis of MProve-Nova, a PoR protocol for Monero that leverages the Nova recursive SNARK to achieve two firsts (without requiring any trusted setup). It is the first Monero PoR protocol that reveals only the number of outputs owned by an exchange; no other information about the outputs or their key images is revealed. It is also the first Monero PoR protocol where the proof size and proof verification time are constant, i.e. they are independent of the number of outputs on the Monero blockchain and the number of outputs owned by the exchange. To achieve constant verification times, MProve-Nova requires a pre-processing step which creates two Merkle trees from all the outputs and key images on the Monero blockchain.\r\n\r\nMProve-Nova consists of two Nova-based subprotocols, a reserves commitment generator (RCG) protocol used to compute a commitment to the total reserves owned by an exchange and a non-collusion (NC) protocol used to prove non-collusion between two exchanges. For the RCG protocol, we observed proof sizes of about 28 KB and verification times of 4.3 seconds. For the NC protocol, we observed proof sizes of about 24 KB and verification times of 0.2 seconds. Proving times for both protocols increase linearly with the number of outputs owned by the exchange but remain independent of the number of outputs on the Monero blockchain. On average, the RCG protocol required about 42 minutes per 1000 outputs and the NC protocol required about 5 minutes per 1000 outputs.",

    "abstract": "Johnson and Lindenstrauss (Contemporary Mathematics, 1984) showed that for $n > m$, a scaled random projection $\\mathbf{A}$ from $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\\mathbb{R}^m$ is an approximate isometry on any set $S$ of size at most exponential in $m$. If $S$ is larger, however, its points can contract arbitrarily under $\\mathbf{A}$. In particular, the hypergrid $([-B, B] \\cap \\mathbb{Z})^n$ is expected to contain a point that is contracted by a factor of $\\kappa_{\\mathsf{stat}} = \\Theta(B)^{-1/\\alpha}$, where $\\alpha = m/n$.\r\n \r\nWe give evidence that finding such a point exhibits a statistical-computational gap precisely up to $\\kappa_{\\mathsf{comp}} = \\widetilde{\\Theta}(\\sqrt{\\alpha}/B)$. On the algorithmic side, we design an online algorithm achieving $\\kappa_{\\mathsf{comp}}$, inspired by a discrepancy minimization algorithm of Bansal and Spencer (Random Structures \\& Algorithms, 2020). On the hardness side, we show evidence via a multiple overlap gap property (mOGP), which in particular captures online algorithms; and a reduction-based lower bound, which shows hardness under standard worst-case lattice assumptions. \r\n\r\nAs a cryptographic application, we show that the rounded Johnson-Lindenstrauss embedding is a robust property-preserving hash function (Boyle, Lavigne and Vaikuntanathan, TCC 2019) on the hypergrid for the Euclidean metric in the computationally hard regime. Such hash functions compress data while preserving $\\ell_2$ distances between inputs up to some distortion factor, with the guarantee that even knowing the hash function, no computationally bounded adversary can find any pair of points that violates the distortion bound.",

With a wide variety of applications, many new constructions have been proposed, each enjoying different features and security guarantees. In this paper, we systematize the designs, features, properties, and applications of vector commitments (VCs). We define vector, polynomial, and functional commitments and we discuss the relationships shared between these types of commitment schemes. We first provide an overview of the definitions of the commitment schemes we will consider, as well as their security notions and various properties they can have. We proceed to compare popular constructions, taking into account the properties each one enjoys, their proof/update information sizes, and their proof/commitment complexities. We also consider their effectiveness in various decentralized and privacy preserving applications. Finally, we conclude by discussing some potential directions for future work.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the Extended Gabidulin (EG) codes and the Interleaved EG (IEG) codes, and enhance the Rank Quasi-Cyclic (RQC) encryption scheme. Our primary contribution is the development of a general decoding algorithm for (I)EG codes, for which we precisely provide the DFR, bound the decoding capacity, and estimate the decoding complexity. As the core tool, we demonstrate that the Linear Reconstruction (LR) problem derived from the decoding (I)EG codes problem can be probabilistically solved, enabling (I)EG codes to achieve arbitrarily small DFRs, decode up to the rank Gilbert-Varshamov bound (even close to the minimal distance), and decode by the Welch-Berlekamp like algorithm. An interesting and important byproduct is that we demonstrate that decoding interleaved Gabidulin codes can be achieved deterministically by solving the LR problem. We finally apply the EG codes to improve RQC (NIST PQC & Asiacrypt 2023). For 128-bit security, our optimized RQC reduces bandwidth by 69 % and 34 % compared to the original versions, respectively. The scheme also achieves at least 50% improvement in efficiency and mitigates MM algebraic attacks (as discussed in Eurocrypt 2020, Asiacrypt 2020 & 2023)  as EG codes facilitate schemes operating over smaller finite fields. Overall, our scheme outperforms code-based schemes of NIST PQC Round 4 submissions, such as HQC, BIKE, and Classic McEliece, in terms of bandwidth. A conservative parameters set still remains competitive bandwidths.",

    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables computation on encrypted data without decryption, demonstrating significant potential for privacy-preserving applications.\r\nHowever, FHE faces several challenges, one of which is the significant plaintext-to-ciphertext expansion ratio, resulting in high communication overhead between client and server. The transciphering technique can effectively address this problem by first encrypting data with a space-efficient symmetric cipher, then converting symmetric ciphertext to FHE ciphertext without decryption.\r\n\r\nNumerous FHE-friendly symmetric ciphers and transciphering methods have been developed by researchers, each with unique advantages and limitations. These often require extensive knowledge of both symmetric cryptography and FHE to fully grasp, making comparison and selection among these schemes challenging. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive survey of over 20 FHE-friendly symmetric ciphers and transciphering methods, evaluating them based on criteria such as security level, efficiency, and compatibility. We have designed and executed experiments to benchmark the performance of the feasible combinations of symmetric ciphers and transciphering methods across various application scenarios. Our findings offer insights into achieving efficient transciphering tailored to different task contexts. Additionally, we make our example code available open-source, leveraging state-of-the-art FHE implementations.",

    "abstract": "Bilinear pairings constitute a cornerstone of public-key cryptography, where advancements in Tate pairings and their efficient variants have emerged as a critical research domain within cryptographic science. Currently, the computation of pairings can be effectively implemented through three distinct algorithmic approaches: Miller\u2019s algorithm, the elliptic net algorithm (as developed by Stange), and cubical-based algorithms (as proposed by Damien Robert). Biextensions are the geometric object underlying the arithmetic of pairings, and all three approaches can be seen as a different way to represent biextension elements. In this paper, we revisit the biextension geometric point of view for pairing computation and investigate in more detail the cubical representation for pairing-based cryptography. Utilizing the twisting isomorphism, we derive explicit formulas and algorithmic frameworks for the ate pairing and optimal ate pairing computations. Additionally, we  present detailed  formulas and introduce an optimized  shared cubical ladder algorithm for super-optimal ate pairings. Through concrete computational analyses, we compare the performance of our cubical-based methods with the Miller's algorithm on various well-known families of pairing-friendly elliptic curves. Our results demonstrate that the cubical-based algorithm outperforms the Miller's algorithm by bits in certain specific situations, establishing its potential as an  alternative for  pairing computation.",

    "abstract": "Multisignature schemes are crucial for secure operations in digital wallets and escrow services within smart contract platforms, particularly in the emerging post-quantum era. Existing post-quantum multisignature constructions either do not address the stringent requirements of the Quantum Random Oracle Model (QROM) or fail to achieve practical efficiency due to suboptimal parameter choices. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present a novel Dilithium-based multisignature scheme designed to be secure in the QROM and optimized for practical use. Our scheme operates over the polynomial ring  $\\mathbb{Z}_q[X]/(x^n+1)$ with $q \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2n}$, enabling full splitting of the ring and allowing for efficient polynomial arithmetic via the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT). This structure not only ensures post-quantum security but also bridges the gap between theoretical constructs and real-world implementation needs.\r\n\r\nWe further propose a new hardness assumption, termed \r\n$\\nu$-SelfTargetMSIS, extending SelfTargetMSIS (Eurocrypt 2018) to accommodate multiple challenge targets. We prove its security in the QROM and leverage it to construct a secure and efficient multisignature scheme. Our approach avoids the limitations of previous techniques, reduces security loss in the reduction, and results in a more compact and practical scheme suitable for deployment in post-quantum cryptographic systems.",

    "abstract": "We show that Montgomery ladders compute pairings as a by-product, and explain how a small adjustment to the ladder results in simple and efficient algorithms for the Weil and Tate pairing on elliptic curves using cubical arithmetic. We demonstrate the efficiency of the resulting cubical pairings in several applications from isogeny-based cryptography. Cubical pairings are simpler and more performant than pairings computed using Miller's algorithm: we get a speed-up of over 40%  for use-cases in SQIsign, and a speed-up of about 7% for use-cases in CSIDH. While these results arise from a deep connection to biextensions and cubical arithmetic, in this article we keep things as concrete (and digestible) as possible. We provide a concise and complete introduction to cubical arithmetic as an appendix.",

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence plays an increasingly important role in decision-making within critical infrastructure, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of neural networks is crucial. This paper addresses the problem of detecting cloned neural networks. We present a method for identifying clones that employs a combination of metrics from both the information and physical domains: output predictions, probability score vectors, and power traces measured from the device running the neural network during inference. We compare the effectiveness of each metric individually, as well as in combination. Our results show that the effectiveness of both the information and the physical domain metrics is excellent for a clone that is a near replica of the target neural network. Furthermore, both the physical domain metric individually and the hybrid approach outperformed the information domain metrics at detecting clones whose weights were extracted with low accuracy. The presented method offers a practical solution for verifying neural network authenticity and integrity. It is particularly useful in scenarios where neural networks are at risk of model extraction attacks, such as in cloud-based machine learning services.",

    "abstract": "The paper analyzes the security of two recently proposed code-based cryptosystems that employ encryption of the form $y = m G_{\\text{pub}} + eE_{pub}$: the Krouk-Kabatiansky-Tavernier (KKT) cryptosystem and the Lau-Ivanov-Ariffin-Chin-Yap (LIACY) cryptosystem. We demonstrate that the KKT cryptosystem can be reduced to a variant of the McEliece scheme, where a small set of columns in the public generator matrix is replaced with random ones. This reduction implies that the KKT cryptosystem is vulnerable to existing attacks on Wieschebrink's encryption scheme, particularly when Generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes are used. In addition, we present a full key-recovery attack on the LIACY cryptosystem by exploiting its linear-algebraic structure and leveraging distinguishers of subcodes of GRS codes. Our findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in both systems, effectively compromising their security despite their novel designs.",

    "abstract": "This paper compares the relative strengths of prominent security notions for onion encryption within the Tor setting, specifically focusing on CircuitHiding (EUROCRYPT 2018, an anonymity flavor notion) and OnionAE (PETS 2018, a stateful authenticated encryption flavor notion). Although both are state-of-the-art, Tor-specific notions, they have exhibited different definitional choices, along with variations in complexity and usability. By employing an indirect approach, we compare them using a set of onion layer-centric notions: IND\\$-CPA, IPR/IPR$^+$, and INT-sfCTXT, to compare with the two, respectively. Since the same notion set that implies OnionAE does not imply CircuitHiding, and vice versa, this leads to the conclusion that OnionAE and CircuitHiding are mutually separable. Therefore, neither notion fully expresses satisfactory security on its own. Importantly, IND\\$-CPA, IPR$^+$ (a stronger variant of IPR), and INT-sfCTXT collectively and strictly imply OnionAE and CircuitHiding. Given their onion layer-centric and thus simpler nature, this provides a practical approach to simultaneously satisfying CircuitHiding and OnionAE. While the formal treatment of (general) public-key onion routing has been relatively well-studied, formal treatment tailored to Tor remains insufficient, and thus our work narrows this gap.",

    "abstract": "Impossible differential attack is one of the major cryptanalytical methods for symmetric-key block ciphers. In this paper, we evaluate the security of SAND-128 against impossible differential attack. SAND is an AND-RX-based lightweight block cipher proposed by Chen et al. in Designs, Codes and Cryptography 2022. There are two variants of SAND, namely SAND-64 and SAND-128, due to structural differences. In this paper, we search for impossible differential distinguishers of SAND-128 using the Constraint Programming (CP) and reveal 14-round impossible differential distinguishers. The number of 14-round distinguishers is $2^{14} \\times 7 = 114,688$. Furthermore, we demonstrate a key recovery attack on 21-round SAND-128. The complexities for the attack require $2^{124}$ data, $2^{127.2}$ encryptions, and $2^{122}$ bytes of memory, respectively. Although this result currently achieves the best attack on round-reduced SAND-128, this attack does not threaten the security of SAND-128 against impossible differential attack.",

    "abstract": "At ASIACRYPT\u201919, Bonnetain et al. demonstrated that an S-box can be distinguished from a permutation chosen uniformly at random by quantifying the distances between their behaviors. In this study, we extend this approach by proposing a deep learning-based method to quantify distances between two different S-boxes and evaluate similarities in their design structures. First, we introduce a deep learning-based framework that trains a neural network model to recover the design structure of a given S-box based on its cryptographic table. We then interpret the decision-making process of our trained model to analyze which coefficients in the table play significant roles in identifying S-box structures. Additionally, we investigate the inference results of our model across various scenarios to evaluate its generalization capabilities. Building upon these insights, we propose a novel approach to quantify distances between structurally different S-boxes. Our method effectively assesses structural similarities by embedding S-boxes using the deep learning model and measuring the distances between their embedding vectors. Furthermore, experimental results confirm that this approach is also applicable to structures that the model has never seen during training. Our findings demonstrate that deep learning can reveal the underlying structural similarities between S-boxes, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for S-box reverse-engineering.",

    "abstract": "Private information retrieval (PIR) allows a client to query a public database privately and serves as a key building block for privacy-enhancing applications. Minimizing query size is particularly important in many use cases, for example when clients operate on low-power or bandwidth-constrained devices. However, existing PIR protocols exhibit large query sizes: to query $2^{25}$ records, the smallest query size of 14.8KB is reported in Respire [Burton et al., CCS'24]. Respire is based on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), where a common approach to lower the client-to-server communication cost is transciphering. When combining the state-of-the-art transciphering [Bon et al., CHES'24] with Respire, the resulting protocol (referred to as T-Respire) has a 336B query size, while incurring a 16.2x times higher server computation cost than Respire.\r\n\r\nOur work presents the Pirouette protocol, which achieves a query size of just 36B without transciphering. This represents a 9.3x reduction compared to T-Respire and a 420x reduction to Respire. For queries over $2^{25}$ records, the single-core server computation in Pirouette is only 2x slower than Respire and 8.1x faster than T-Respire, and the server computation is highly parallelizable. Furthermore, Pirouette requires no database-specific hint for clients and naturally extends to support queries over encrypted databases.",

    "abstract": "As one of the famous quantum algorithms, Simon's algorithm enables the efficient derivation of the period of periodic functions in polynomial time.  However, the complexity of constructing periodic functions has hindered the widespread application of Simon's algorithm in symmetric-key cryptanalysis. Currently, aside from the exhaustive search-based testing method introduced by Canale et al. at CRYPTO 2022, there is no unified model for effectively searching for periodic distinguishers. Although Xiang et al. established a link between periodic function and truncated differential theory at ToSC 2024, their approach lacks the ability to construct periods using unknown differentials and does not provide automated tools. This limitation underscores the inadequacy of existing methods in identifying periodic distinguishers for complex structures. In this paper, we address the challenge of advancing periodic distinguishers for symmetric-key ciphers. First, we propose a more generalized theory for constructing periodic distinguishers, addressing the limitations of Xiang et al.'s theory in handling unknown differences. We further extend our theory to probabilistic periodic distinguishers, thereby extending the separability property proposed by Hod\u017ei\u0107 et al. in 2020. As a result, our theory can cover a wider range of periodic distinguishers. Second, we introduce a novel symbolic representation to simplify the search of periodic distinguishers. Based upon this representation, we propose the first fully automated SMT-based search model, which efficiently addresses the challenges of manual searching in complex structures. Finally, we extend the model to SPN structures based on our new theory. Our model has broad applicability through significant advancements in analyzing generalized Feistel structures (GFSs) and SPN-based ciphers. As a general model, we have achieved new quantum distinguishers with the following round configurations: 10 rounds for GFS-4F, 10 rounds for LBlock, 10 rounds for TWINE, and 16 rounds for Skipjack-B, improving the previous best results by 2, 2, 2, and 3 rounds, respectively. In the domain of SPN-based ciphers, our model has enabled the identification of novel periodic distinguishers, including the first 9-round distinguisher for SKINNY and the first 12-round distinguisher for CRAFT. These achievements lay the foundation for quantum cryptanalysis of SPN-based ciphers using Simon\u2019s algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Since the standardization of the Secure Group Messaging protocol Messaging Layer Security (MLS) [4 ], whose core subprotocol is a Continuous Group Key Agreement (CGKA) mechanism named TreeKEM, CGKAs have become the norm for group key exchange protocols. However, in order to alleviate the security issue originating from the fact that all users in a CGKA are able to carry out sensitive operations on the member group, an augmented protocol called Administrated-CGKA (A-CGKA) has been recently created [2].\r\n\r\nAn A-CGKA includes in the cryptographic protocol the management of the administration rights that restrict the set of privileged users, giving strong security guarantees for the group administration. The protocol designed in [2] is a plugin added to a regular (black-box) CGKA, which consequently add some complexity to the underlying CGKA and curtail its performances. Yet, leaving the fully decentralized paradigm of a CGKA offers the perspective of new protocol designs, potentially more efficient.\r\n\r\nWe propose in this paper an A-CGKA called SUMAC, which offers strongly enhanced communication and storage performances compared to other A-CGKAs and even to TreeKEM. Our protocol is based on a novel design that modularly combines a regular CGKA used by the administrators of the group and a Tree-structured Multicast Key Agreement (TMKA) [9] \u2013 which is a centralized group key exchange mechanism administrated by a single group manager \u2013 between each administrator and all the standard users. That TMKA gives SUMAC an asymptotic communication cost logarithmic in the number of users, similarly to a CGKA. However, the concrete performances of our protocol are much better than the latter, especially in the post-quantum framework, due to the intensive use of secret-key cryptography that offers a lighter bandwidth than the public-key encryption schemes from a CGKA.\r\n\r\nIn practice, SUMAC improves the communication cost of TreeKEM by a factor 1.4 to 2.4 for admin operations and a factor 2 to 38 for user operations. Similarly, its storage cost divides that of TreeKEM by a factor 1.3 to 23 for an administrator and 3.9 to 1,070 for a standard user.\r\n\r\nOur analysis of SUMAC is provided along with a ready-to-use open-source rust implementation that confirms the feasibility and the performances of our protocol.",

    "abstract": "A multi-server private information retrieval (PIR) protocol allows a client to obtain an entry of its choice from a database, held by one or more servers, while hiding the identity of the entry from small enough coalitions of servers. In this paper, we study PIR protocols in which some of the servers are malicious and may not send messages according to the pre-described protocol. In previous papers, such protocols were defined by requiring that they are correct, private, and robust to malicious servers, i.e., by listing 3 properties that they should satisfy. However, 40 years of experience in studying secure multiparty protocols taught us that defining the security of protocols by a list of required properties is problematic. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we rectify this situation and define the security of PIR protocols with malicious servers using the real vs. ideal paradigm. We study the relationship between the property-based definition of PIR protocols and the real vs. ideal definition, showing the following results:\r\n\r\n- We prove that if we require full security from PIR protocols, e.g., the client outputs the correct value of the database entry with high probability even if a minority of the servers are malicious, then the two definitions are equivalent. This implies that constructions of such protocols that were proven secure using the property-based definition are actually secure under the ``correct'' definition of security.  \r\n\r\n- We show that if we require security-with-abort from PIR protocols (called PIR protocols with error-detection in previous papers), i.e., protocols in which the user either outputs the correct value or an abort symbol, then there are protocols that are secure under the property-based definition; however, they do not satisfy the real vs. ideal definition, that is, they can be attacked allowing selective abort. This shows that the property-based definition of PIR protocols with security-with-abort is problematic. \r\n\r\n- We consider the compiler of  Eriguchi et al. (TCC 22) that starts with a PIR protocol that is secure against semi-honest servers and constructs a PIR protocol with security-with-abort; this compiler implies the best-known PIR protocols with security-with-abort. We show that applying this protocol does not result in PIR protocols that are secure according to the real vs. ideal definition. However, we prove that a simple modification of this compiler results in PIR protocols that are secure according to the real vs. ideal definition.",

    "abstract": "The Secure Shell (SSH) protocol is one of the first security protocols on the Internet to upgrade itself to resist attacks against future quantum computers, with the default adoption of the \"quantum (otherwise, classically)\" secure hybrid key exchange in OpenSSH from April 2022. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive security analysis of this quantum-resistant version of SSH in the literature: related works either focus on the hybrid key exchange in isolation and do not consider security of the overall protocol, or analyze the protocol in security models which are not appropriate for SSH, especially in the \"post-quantum\" setting.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we remedy the state of affairs by providing a thorough post-quantum cryptographic analysis of SSH. We follow a \"top-down\" approach wherein we first prove security of SSH in a more appropriate model, namely, our post-quantum extension of the so-called authenticated and confidential channel establishment (ACCE) protocol security model; our extension which captures \"harvest now, decrypt later\" attacks could be of independent interest. Then we establish the cryptographic properties of SSH's underlying primitives, as concretely instantiated in practice, based on our protocol-level ACCE security analysis: for example, we prove relevant cryptographic properties of \"Streamlined NTRU Prime\", a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) which is used in recent versions of OpenSSH and TinySSH, in the quantum random oracle model, and address open problems related to its analysis in the literature. Notably, our ACCE security analysis of post-quantum SSH relies on the weaker notion of IND-CPA security of the ephemeral KEMs used in the hybrid key exchange. This is in contrast to prior works which rely on the stronger assumption of IND-CCA secure ephemeral KEMs. Hence we conclude the paper with a discussion on potentially replacing IND-CCA secure KEMs in current post-quantum implementations of SSH with simpler and faster IND-CPA secure counterparts, and also provide the corresponding benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "We revisit the longstanding open problem of implementing Nakamoto's proof-of-work (PoW) consensus based on a real-world computational task $T(x)$ (as opposed to artificial random hashing), in a truly  permissionless setting where the miner itself chooses the input $x$. The challenge in designing such a Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) protocol, is using the native computation of $T(x)$ to produce a PoW certificate with prescribed hardness and with negligible computational overhead over the worst-case complexity of $T(\\cdot)$ -- This  ensures malicious miners cannot ``game the system\" by fooling the verifier to accept with higher probability compared to honest miners (while using similar computational resources). Indeed, obtaining a PoUW with $O(1)$-factor overhead is trivial for any task $T$, but also useless. \r\n\r\nOur main result is a PoUW for the task of Matrix Multiplication $\\mathsf{MatMul}(A,B)$ of arbitrary matrices with  $1+o(1)$ multiplicative overhead compared to na\\\"ive $\\mathsf{MatMul}$ (even in the presence of Fast Matrix Multiplication-style algorithms, which are currently impractical). We conjecture that our protocol has optimal security in the sense that a malicious prover cannot obtain any significant advantage over an honest prover. This conjecture is based on reducing hardness of our protocol to the task of solving a batch of low-rank random linear equations which is of independent interest.\r\n\r\nSince $\\mathsf{MatMul}$s are the bottleneck of AI compute as well as countless industry-scale applications, this primitive suggests a concrete design of a new L1 base-layer protocol, which nearly eliminates the energy-waste of Bitcoin mining -- allowing GPU consumers to reduce their AI training and inference costs by ``re-using\" it for blockchain consensus, in exchange for block rewards (2-for-1). This blockchain is currently under construction.",

    "abstract": "Most homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes exploit a technique called single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) to process several messages in parallel. However, they base their security in somehow strong assumptions, such as the hardness of approximate lattice problems with superpolynomial approximation factor. On the other extreme of the spectrum, there are lightweight FHE schemes that have much faster bootstrapping but no SIMD capabilities. On the positive side, the security of these schemes is based on lattice problems with (low-degree) polynomial approximation factor only, which is a much weaker security assumption. Aiming the best of those two options, Micciancio and Sorrell (ICALP'18) proposed a new amortized bootstrapping that can process many messages at once, yielding sublinear time complexity per message, and allowing one to construct FHE based on lattice problems with polynomial approximation factor.\r\nSome subsequent works on this line achieve near-optimal asymptotic performance, nevertheless, concrete efficiency remains mostly an open problem. The only existing implementation to date (GPV23, Asiacrypt 2023) requires keys of up to a hundred gigabytes while only providing gains for relatively large messages. In this paper, we introduce a new method for amortized bootstrapping where the number of homomorphic operations required per message is $O(h)$ and the noise overhead is $O(\\sqrt{h \\lambda} \\log \\lambda)$, where $h$ is the Hamming weight of the LWE secret key and $\\lambda$ is the security parameter. This allows us to use much smaller parameters and to obtain faster running time. Our method is based on a new efficient homomorphic evaluation of sparse polynomial multiplication. We bootstrap 2 to 8-bit messages in 1.1 ms to 26.5 ms, respectively. Compared to TFHE-rs, this represents a performance improvement of 3.9 to 41.5 times while requiring bootstrapping keys up to 50.4 times smaller.",

    "abstract": "As billions of people rely on end-to-end encrypted messaging, the exposure of metadata, such as communication timing and participant relationships, continues to deanonymize users. Asynchronous metadata-hiding solutions with strong cryptographic guarantees have historically been bottlenecked by quadratic $O(N^2)$ server computation in the number of users $N$ due to reliance on private information retrieval (PIR). We present Myco, a metadata-private messaging system that preserves strong cryptographic guarantees while achieving $O(N \\log^2 N)$ efficiency. To achieve this, we depart from PIR and instead introduce an oblivious data structure through which senders and receivers privately communicate. To unlink reads and writes, we instantiate Myco in an asymmetric two-server distributed-trust model where clients write messages to one server tasked with obliviously transmitting these messages to another server, from which clients read. Myco achieves throughput improvements of up to 302x over multi-server and 2,219x over single-server state-of-the-art systems based on PIR.",

    "abstract": "Side-channel analysis (SCA) has emerged as a critical field in securing\r\nhardware implementations against potential vulnerabilities. With the advent of artificial intelligence(AI), neural network-based approaches have proven to be among the most useful techniques for profiled SCA. Despite the success of NN-assisted SCA, a critical challenge remains, namely understanding predictive uncertainty. NNs are often uncertain in their predictions, leading to incorrect key guesses with high\r\nprobabilities, corresponding to a higher rank associated with the correct key. This uncertainty stems from multiple factors, including measurement errors, randomness in physical quantities, and variability in NN training. Understanding whether this uncertainty arises from inherent data characteristics or can be mitigated through better training is crucial. Additionally, if data uncertainty dominates, identifying\r\nspecific trace features responsible for misclassification becomes essential.\r\n\r\nWe propose a novel approach to estimating uncertainty in NN-based SCA by leveraging Renyi entropy, which offers a generalized framework for capturing various forms of uncertainty. This metric allows us to quantify uncertainty in NN predictions and explain its impact on key recovery. We decompose uncertainty into epistemic (model-related) and aleatoric (data-related) components. Given the challenge of estimating probability distributions in high-dimensional spaces, we use matrix-based Renyi \u03b1-entropy and \u03b1-divergence to better approximate leakage distributions, addressing the limitations of KL divergence in SCA. We also explore the sources of uncertainty, e.g., resynchronization, randomized keys, as well as hyperparameters related to NN training. To identify which time instances (features in traces) contribute most to uncertainty, we also integrate SHAP explanations with our framework, overcoming the limitations of conventional sensitivity analysis. Lastly, we show that predictive uncertainty strongly correlates with standard SCA metrics like rank, offering a complementary measure for evaluating attack complexity. Our theoretical findings are backed by extensive experiments on available datasets and NN models.",

We test their impact on the network's ability to discriminate sequences from a low-quality RNG versus a high-quality one\u2014that is, to discriminate between \"optimal\" sequence sets and those from the generator under test. When the network fails to distinguish them, the test is passed. For this test to be useful, the network must have real discrimination capabilities. We review several network design possibilities showing significant differences in the  obtained results. The best option presented here is convolutional networks working on 5120-byte sequences.",

    "abstract": "The securities of a large fraction of zero-knowledge arguments of knowledge schemes rely on the discrete logarithm (DL) assumption or the discrete logarithm relation assumption, such as Bulletproofs (S&P 18) and compressed $\\Sigma$-protocol (CRYPTO 20). At the heart of these protocols is an interactive proof of knowledge between a prover and a verifier showing that a Pedersen vector commitment $P=h^{\\rho}\\cdot\\textbf{g}^{\\textbf{x}}$  to a vector $\\textbf{x}$  satisfies multi-variate equations, where the DL relations among the vector of generators $\\textbf{g}$ are unknown. However, in some circumstances, the prover may know the DL relations among the generators, and the DL relation assumption no longer holds, such as ring signatures, ring confidential transactions (RingCT) and K-out-of-N proofs, which will make the soundness proof of these protocols infeasible.\r\nThis paper is concerned with a problem called knowledge of known discrete logarithms (KKDL) that appears but has not been clearly delineated in the literature.  Namely, it asks to prove a set of multi-exponent equalities, starting with the fact that the prover may know the DL relations among the generators of these equalities.  Our contributions are three-fold:  (1) We propose a special honest-verifier zero-knowledge protocol for the problem.  Using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic and the improved inner-product argument of Bulletproofs,  the proof size of our protocol is logarithmic to the dimension of the vector. (2) As applications, our protocol can be utilized to construct logarithmic-size RingCT securely which fixes the issues of Omniring (CCS 19), ring signatures (with signature size $2\\cdot \\lceil \\log_2(N) \\rceil+10$ for ring size $N$) and  $K$-out-of-$N$ proof of knowledge (with proof size $2\\cdot \\lceil \\log_2(N) \\rceil+14$) which achieves the most succinct proof size improving on previous results. Meanwhile, we propose the first account-based multi-receiver privacy scheme considering the sender's privacy with logarithmic proof size (to the best of our knowledge). (3) We describe an attack on RingCT-3.0 (FC 20) where an attacker can spend a coin of an arbitrary amount that never existed on the blockchain.",

    "abstract": "Constructing and implementing isogeny-based cryptographic primitives is an active research. In particular, performing length-$n$ isogenies walks over quadratic field extensions of $\\mathbb{F}_p$ plays an exciting role in some constructions, including\r\nHash functions, Verifiable Delay Functions, Key-Encapsulation Mechanisms, and generic proof systems for isogeny knowledge.\r\nRemarkably, many isogeny-based constructions, for efficiency, perform $2$-isogenies through square root calculations.\r\n\r\nThis work analyzes the idea of using $3$-isogenies instead of $2$-isogenies, which replaces the requirement of calculating square roots with cube roots. Performing length-$m$ $3$-isogenies allows shorter isogeny walks than when employing length-$n$ $2$-isogenies since a cube root calculation costs essentially the same as computing a square root, and we require $3^m \\approx 2^n$ to provide the same security level.\r\n\r\nWe propose an efficient mapping from arbitrary supersingular Montgomery curves defined over $\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ to the $3$-isogeny curve model from Castryck, Decru, and Vercauteren (Asiacrypt 2020); a deterministic algorithm to compute all order-$3$ points on arbitrary supersingular Montgomery curves, and an efficient algorithm to compute length-$m$ $3$-isogeny chains.\r\n\r\nWe improve the length-$m$ $3$-isogeny walks required by the KEM from Nakagawa and Onuki (CRYPTO 2024) by using our results and introducing more suitable parameter sets that are friendly with C-code implementations. In particular, our experiments illustrate an improvement of 26.41\\%--35.60\\% in savings when calculating length-$m$ $3$-isogeny chains and using our proposed parameters instead of those proposed by Nakagawa and Onuki (CRYPTO 2024).\r\n\r\nFinally, we enhance the key generation of $\\mathsf{CTIDH}$-2048 by including radical $3$-isogeny chains over the basefield $\\mathbb{F}_p$, reducing the overhead of finding a $3$-torsion basis as required in some instantiations of the $\\mathsf{CSIDH}$ protocol. Our experiments illustrate the advantage of radical $3$ isogenies in the key generation of $\\mathsf{CTIDH}$-2048, with an improvement close to 4x faster than the original $\\mathsf{dCTIDH}$.",

    "abstract": "An interactive aggregate signature scheme allows $n$ signers, each with their own secret/public key pair $(sk_i, pk_i)$ and message $m_i$, to jointly produce a short signature that simultaneously witnesses that $m_i$ has been signed under $pk_i$ for every $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. Despite the large potential for savings in terms of space and verification time, which constitute the two main bottlenecks for large blockchain systems such as Bitcoin, aggregate signatures have received much less attention than the other members of the multi-party signature family, namely multi-signatures such as $\\mathsf{MuSig2}$ and threshold signatures such as $\\mathsf{FROST}$.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose $\\mathsf{DahLIAS}$, the first aggregate signature scheme with constant-size signatures\u2014a signature has the same shape as a standard Schnorr signature\u2014directly based on discrete logarithms in pairing-free groups. The signing protocol of $\\mathsf{DahLIAS}$ consists of two rounds, the first of which can be preprocessed without the message, and verification (for a signature created by $n$ signers) is dominated by one multi-exponentiation of size $n+1$, which is asymptotically twice as fast as batch verification of $n$ individual Schnorr signatures.\r\n\r\n$\\mathsf{DahLIAS}$ is designed with real-world applications in mind. Besides the aforementioned benefits of space savings and verification speedups, $\\mathsf{DahLIAS}$ offers key tweaking, a technique commonly used in Bitcoin to derive keys in hierarchical deterministic wallets and to save space as well as enhance privacy on the blockchain. We prove $\\mathsf{DahLIAS}$ secure in the concurrent setting with key tweaking under the (algebraic) one-more discrete logarithm assumption in the random oracle model.",

    "abstract": "Safety and liveness are the two classical security properties of consensus protocols. Recent works have strengthened safety with accountability: should any safety violation occur, a sizable fraction of adversary nodes can be proven to be protocol violators. This paper studies to what extent analogous accountability guarantees are achievable for liveness. To reveal the full complexity of this question, we introduce an interpolation between the classical synchronous and partially-synchronous models that we call the $x$-partially-synchronous network model in which, intuitively, at most an $x$ fraction of the time steps in any sufficiently long interval are asynchronous (and, as with a partially-synchronous network, all time steps are synchronous following the passage of an unknown \"global stablization time\"). We prove a precise characterization of the parameter regime in which accountable liveness is achievable: if and only if $x < 1/2$ and $f < n/2$, where $n$ denotes the number of nodes and $f$ the number of nodes controlled by an adversary. We further refine the problem statement and our analysis by parameterizing by the number of violating nodes identified following a liveness violation, and provide evidence that the guarantees achieved by our protocol are near-optimal (as a function of $x$ and $f$). Our results provide rigorous foundations for liveness-accountability heuristics such as the  \"inactivity leaks\" employed in Ethereum.",

Since the introduction of anonymous credentials by Chaum in 1985, there has been promising advances with respect to system design, security analysis and real-world implementations of anonymous credential systems.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we examine Hyperledger AnonCreds, an anonymous credential system that was introduced in 2017 and is currently undergoing specification. Despite being implemented in deployment-ready identity system platforms, there is no formal security analysis of the Hyperledger AnonCreds protocol. We rectify this, presenting syntax and a security model for, and a first security analysis of, the Hyperledger AnonCreds protocol. In particular, we demonstrate that Hyperledger AnonCreds is correct, and satisfies notions of unforgeability and anonymity. We conclude with a discussion on the implications of our findings, highlighting the importance of rigorous specification efforts to support security evaluation of real-world cryptographic protocols.",

    "abstract": "PLONK is a prominent universal and updatable zk-SNARK for general circuit satisfiability, which allows a prover to produce a short certificate of the validity of a certain statement/computation. Its expressive model of computation and its highly efficient verifier complexity make PLONK a powerful tool for a wide range of blockchain applications.\r\n\r\nSupporting standard cryptographic primitives (such us ECDSA over SECP256k1) or advanced recursive predicates (e.g. incrementally verifiable computation) on a SNARK presents a significant challenge. It requires so-called foreign-field arithmetic (enforcing constraints over algebraic fields that differ from the SNARK native field) which was previously believed to incur an overhead of two or three orders of magnitude.\r\n\r\nWe build on the techniques by Lubarov and Baylina and observe that, by considering tight bounds on their encoding of foreign-field multiplication, the number of PLONK constraints can be significantly reduced. We show that these techniques also extend to elliptic curve emulation, with an overhead of just one order of magnitude (with respect to its native counterpart). We validate soundness and completeness of our main results in EasyCrypt. Finally, we implement an open-source library with support for foreign-field arithmetic. Our experimental results showcase the generality of our techniques and confirm their suitability for real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Amortized bootstrapping techniques have been proposed for FHEW/TFHE to efficiently refresh multiple ciphertexts simultaneously within a polynomial modulus. Although recent proposals have very efficient asymptotic complexity, reducing the amortized cost essentially to $\\tilde{O}(1)$ FHE multiplications, the practicality of such algorithms still suffers from substantial overhead and high decryption failure rates (DFR). In this study, we improve upon one of the state-of-the-art amortized bootstrapping algorithms (Guimar\u00e3es et al., ASIACRYPT 2023) for FHEW/TFHE-like schemes by introducing an alternative algorithmic strategy. Specifically, we combine Guimar\u00e3es et al.'s strategy based on a two-part NTT with an incomplete Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) algorithm. As a result, we demonstrate a 2.12$\\times$ speedup compared to the algorithm of Guimar\u00e3es et al. and a $1.12\\times$ improvement over the state-of-the-art (sequential) TFHE-rs while achieving a DFR close to $2^{-32}$ for 7-bit messages, although the DFR is higher for 8-bit messages. We also explore trade-offs between execution time and DFR, identifying parameter sets that improve execution time of Guimar\u00e3es et al. by $1.41\\times$, while simultaneously reducing the DFR by a factor of $2^{-22}$ for 8-bit messages.",

    "abstract": "At CRYPTO 2019, Gohr pioneered the integration of differential cryptanalysis with neural networks, demonstrating significant advantages over traditional distinguishers. Subsequently, at Inscrypt 2020, Su et al. proposed the concept of constructing polyhedral differential neural distinguishers by leveraging multiple effective input differences. More recently, at FSE 2024, Bellini et al. introduced a general-purpose tool for automating the training of single-key differential neural distinguishers for various block ciphers. Inspired by this body of work, we aim to extend automated search techniques to related-key differential neural distinguishers, enabling the discovery of effective input differences and key differences for such distinguishers. To achieve this, we employ a genetic optimization algorithm to identify effective differential combinations. To validate the efficacy of our method, we apply it to the Simeck and Simon cipher families, successfully identifying effective differential combinations for the three variants of Simeck and ten variants of Simon. Furthermore, inspired by the concept of polyhedral neural distinguishers, we adopt a novel data format that leverages multiple distinct input differences and key differences to construct positive and negative samples, providing the neural network with a richer set of features. Our approach not only identify high-quality distinguishers for previously unexplored cipher variants but also achieve higher accuracy for related-key differential neural distinguishers compared to the state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based side-channel analysis is an extremely powerful option for profiling side-channel attacks. However, to perform well, one needs to select the neural network model and training time hyperparameters carefully. While many works investigated these aspects, random search could still be considered the current state-of-the-art. Unfortunately, random search has drawbacks, since the chances of finding a good architecture significantly drop when considering more complex targets.\r\nIn this paper, we propose a novel neural architecture search approach for SCA based on grammatical evolution - SCAGE. We define a custom SCA grammar that allows us to find well-performing and potentially unconventional architectures. We conduct experiments on four datasets, considering both synchronized and desynchronized versions, as well as using feature intervals or raw traces. Our results show SCAGE to perform extremely well in all settings, outperforming random search and related works in most of the considered scenarios.",

    "abstract": "This document is a preliminary version of what is intended to be submitted to NIST by Zama as part of their threshold call. The document also serves as partial documentation of the protocols used in the Zama MPC system for threshold TFHE.\r\n\r\nHowever, note that the Zama software includes many optimizations built on top of the simple specifications given here. In particular the TFHE parameters given here are larger than those used by the Zama software. This is because the Zama TFHE library contains optimizations which are beyond the scope of this document. Thus the parameters given in this document are compatible with the description of TFHE given here, and take no account of the extra optimizations in the Zama software.\r\n\r\nAlso note that we describe more protocols than that provided in the Zama software. In particular this document describes BGV and BFV threshold implementations, MPC-in-the-Head based proofs of correct encryption.\r\n\r\nWe present mechanisms to perform robust threshold key generation and decryption for Fully Homomorphic Encryption schemes such as BGV, BFV and TFHE, in the case of super honest majority, t < n/3, or t < n/4, in the presence of malicious adversaries.\r\n\r\nThe main mechanism for threshold decryptions follow the noise flooding principle, which we argue is sufficient for BGV and BFV. For TFHE a more subtle technique is needed to apply noise flooding, since TFHE parameters are small. To deal with all three FHE scheme, and obtain a unified framework for all such schemes, we are led to consider secret sharing over Galois Rings and not just finite fields.\r\n\r\nWe consider two sets of threshold profiles, depending on whether binomial(n,t) is big or small. In the small case we obtain for all schemes an asynchronous protocol for robust threshold decryption, and we obtain a robust synchronous protocol for threshold key generation; both with t < n/3. For the large case we only support TFHE, and our protocols require an \u201coffline phase\u201d which requires synchronous networks and can \u201conly\u201d tolerate t < n/4.\r\n\r\nThe threshold key generation operation, and the above mentioned offline phase, require access to a generic offline MPC functionality over arbitrary Galois Rings. This functionality is fully specified here. Finally, we present Zero-Knowledge proof techniques for proving the valid encryption of an FHE ciphertext. These proofs are important in a number of application contexts.",

    "abstract": "The major Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) schemes guarantee the privacy of the encrypted message only in the honest-but-curious setting, when the server follows the protocol without deviating. However, various attacks in the literature show that an actively malicious server can recover sensitive information by executing incorrect functions, tampering with ciphertexts, or observing the client\u2019s reaction during decryption.\r\n\r\nExisting integrity solutions for FHE schemes either fail to guarantee circuit privacy, exposing the server's computations to the client, or introduce significant computational overhead on the prover by requiring proofs of FHE operations on ciphertexts.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we present Fherret, a novel scheme leveraging the MPC-in-the-Head (MPCitH) paradigm to provide a proof of correct-and-honest homomorphic evaluation while preserving circuit privacy. This proof guarantees that the client can safely decrypt the ciphertext obtained from the server without being susceptible to reaction-based attacks, such as verification and decryption oracle attacks. Additionally, this proof guarantees that the server\u2019s evaluation maintains correctness, thereby protecting the client from $\\mathsf{IND}\\text{-}\\mathsf{CPA}^{\\mathsf{D}}$-style attacks.\r\n\r\nOur solution achieves a prover overhead of $4\\lambda$ homomorphic evaluations of random functions from the function space $\\mathcal{F}$, while retaining a competitive verifier overhead of $2 \\lambda$ homomorphic evaluations and a communication size proportional to $\\sqrt{2\\lambda}$ times the size of a function from $\\mathcal{F}$. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, Fherret is inherently parallelizable, achieving a parallel computation overhead similar to a homomorphic evaluation of a random function from $\\mathcal{F}$ for both the prover and the verifier.",

    "abstract": "Searchable encryption (SE) enables privacy-preserving keyword search on encrypted data. Public-key SE (PKSE) supports multi-user searches but suffers from high search latency due to expensive public-key operations. Symmetric SE (SSE) offers a sublinear search but is mainly limited to single-user settings. Recently, hybrid SE (HSE) has combined SSE and PKSE to achieve the best of both worlds, including multi-writer encrypted search functionalities, forward privacy, and sublinear search with respect to database size. Despite its advantages, HSE inherits critical security limitations, such as susceptibility to dictionary attacks, and still incurs significant overhead for search access control verification, requiring costly public-key operation invocations (i.e., pairing) across all authorized keywords. Additionally, its search access control component must be rebuilt periodically for forward privacy, imposing substantial writer overhead.   \r\nIn this paper, we propose Hermes, a new HSE scheme that addresses the aforementioned security issues in prior HSE designs while maintaining minimal search complexity and user efficiency at the same time. Hermes enables multi-writer encrypted search functionalities and offers forward privacy along with resilience to dictionary attacks. To achieve this, we develop a new identity-based encryption scheme with hidden identity and key-aggregate properties, which could be of independent interest. We also design novel partitioning and epoch encoding techniques in Hermes to minimize search complexity and offer low user overhead in maintaining forward privacy. We conducted intensive experiments to assess and compare the performance of Hermes and its counterpart on commodity hardware. Experimental results showed that Hermes performs search one to two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art HSE while offering stronger security guarantees to prevent dictionary and injection attacks.",

    "abstract": "We present concrete techniques for adapting the protocols of Mohassel et al (CCS 2020) and  Badrinarayanan et al (CCS 2022)\r\nfor compute SQL-like querying operations on secret shared database tables  to the two party setting. The afore mentioned protocols are presented in a generic setting with access to certain idealized functionalities, e.g. secret shared permutations. However, they only instantiate their protocols in the honest majority three party setting due to other settings being considered too inefficient. We show that this is no longer the case. In particular, the recent work of Peceny et al. (eprint 2024) gives a concretely efficient two party permutation protocol. Additionally, we give a new and highly efficient protocol for evaluating the strong PRF recently proposed by Alamati et al. (Crypto 2024). Building on these advancements, along with a variety of protocol improvements and significant cryptographic engineering, our open source implementation demonstrate concretely efficient two party SQL-like querying functionality on secret shared data.\r\n\r\nWe focus on the two party setting with secret shared input and output tables. The first protocol $\\Pi_\\textsf{Join-OO}$ is designed for the setting where the join keys are unique, similar to Private Set Intersection (PSI) except that the inputs and output are secret shared. This protocol is constant round and $O(n)$ running time. The secret protocol $\\Pi_\\textsf{Join-OM}$ allows one of the tables to contain repeating join keys. Our instantiations achieves $O(n\\log n)$ running time and $O(\\log n)$ rounds of interaction.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) allows clients to engage in learning without revealing their raw data. However, traditional FL focuses on developing a single global model for all clients, limiting their ability to have personalized models tailored to their specific needs. Personalized FL (PFL) enables clients to obtain their customized models, either with or without a central party.  Current PFL research includes mechanisms to detect poisoning attacks, in which a couple of malicious nodes try to manipulate training convergence by submitting misleading data. However, these detection approaches often overlook privacy concerns, as they require clients to share their models with all other clients.\r\nThis paper extends BALANCE, a personalized poisoning detection mechanism based on client models and their expectations. Our method enhances both security and privacy by ensuring clients are not required to share their model data with other clients. By leveraging server-assisted PFL and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), we enable a central party to identify unpoisoned clients from the perspective of individual clients and train personalized models securely. Additionally, we introduce an efficient personalized client selection algorithm that prevents redundant checks and ensures the inheritance of unpoisoned clients.",

    "abstract": "Proxy re-encryption (PRE) schemes allow a delegator to designate a proxy to re-encrypt its ciphertext into a ciphertext that the delegatee can decrypt. In contrast, the proxy gains nothing helpful from this transformation. This decryption-power transfer is proper in applications of encrypted email forwarding, key escrow, and publish/subscribe systems.\r\n\r\nThe security notions for PRE are inherited from the standard public key encryption (PKE) schemes, i.e., indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attacks (CPA) and security under chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCA). A recently popular notion, indistinguishability under honest re-encryption attacks (HRA), was proposed by Cohen in 2019, indicating that CPA security is insufficient for PRE because some CPA-secure PRE leaks the secret key of the delegator. Many post-quantum secure PRE schemes have recently been designed under the HRA security model.\r\n\r\nHowever, HRA security differs from traditional CCA security, and there is no known reduction between them. The existing results show they appear to be incompatible. This paper aims to bridge those two security notions via reductions. In addition, we found that many existing HRA-secure schemes are vulnerable to collusion. We provide a generic transformation from a CPA-secure PRE to a collusion-resistant and CPA-secure PRE. This transformation also applies to HRA-secure PREs.",

    "abstract": "The security of the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) depends on the uniqueness and secrecy of the nonce, which is used in each signature. While it is well understood that nonce $k$ reuse across two distinct messages can leak the private key, we show that even if a distinct value is used for $k_2$, where an affine relationship exists in the form of: \\(k_m = a \\cdot k_n + b\\), we can also recover the private key. Our method requires only two signatures (even over the same message) and relies purely on algebra, with no need for lattice reduction or brute-force search(if the relationship, or offset, is known). To our knowledge, this is the first closed-form derivation of the ECDSA private key from only two signatures over the same message, under a known affine relationship between nonces.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines how quantum computing enhances the encryption system. It studies the relationship between cryptography and quantum physics. The paper considers the historical progression of encryption techniques paying attention to the altering nature of security challenges. Moreover, it analyzes the basic principles of quantum computing, describing its theoretical concept and its advantages over classical systems in terms of potential performance. Also, it focuses on an in-depth analysis of Grovers\u2019 Algorithm showing its unique searching capability and its implications for encryption schemes. The paper also reviews the limitations of Grover\u2019s Algorithm that could make it vulnerable to attacks and how to make it safer. Also, the methods of quantum computing that create strong encryption are briefly outlined. Overall, in the quest for secure systems of communication in the era of quantum, the paper aims at the futuristic paradigm shift by considering the emergence of Quantum-Powered Encryption Systems. It answers key questions about this subject through both, qualitative and quantitative analysis. The provided scientific report supplements the existing body of knowledge about the relationship between quantum computers and encryption systems and sets the foundation for better and more secure encryption for the digital world.",

    "abstract": "Some of our current public key methods use a trap door to implement digital signature methods. This includes the RSA method, which uses Fermat's little theorem to support the creation and verification of a digital signature. The problem with a back-door is that the actual trap-door method could, in the end, be discovered. With the rise of PQC (Post Quantum Cryptography), we will see a range of methods that will not use trap doors and provide stronger proof of security. In this case, we use hash-based signatures (as used with SPHINCS+) and Fiat Shamir signatures using Zero Knowledge Proofs (as used with Dilithium).",

    "abstract": "Sampling a non degenerate (that is, invertible) square matrix over a finite field is easy, draw a random square matrix and discard if the determinant is zero. We address the problem in higher dimensions, and sample non degenerate boundary format tensors, which generalise square matrices. Testing degeneracy is conjectured to be hard in more than two dimensions, precluding the \"draw a random tensor and discard if degenerate'' recipe. The difficulty is in computing hyperdeterminants, higher dimensional analogues of determinants. Instead, we start with a structured random non degenerate tensor and scramble it by infusing more randomness while still preserving non degeneracy. We propose two kinds of scrambling. The first is  multiplication in each dimension by random invertible matrices, which preserves dimension and format. Assuming pseudo randomness of this action, which also underlies tensor isomorphism based cryptography, our samples are computationally indistinguishable from uniform non degenerate tensors. The second scrambling employs tensor convolution (that generalises multiplication by matrices) and can increase dimension. Inspired by hyperdeterminant multiplicativity, we devise a recursive sampler that uses tensor convolution to reduce the problem from arbitrary to three dimensions.\r\n\r\nOur sampling is a candidate solution for drawing public keys in tensor isomorphism based cryptography, since non degenerate tensors elude recent weak key attacks targeting public key tensors either containing geometric structures such as \"triangles\" or being deficient in tensor rank. To accommodate our sampling, tensor isomorphism based schemes need to be instantiated in boundary formats such as (2k+1) x (k+1) x (k+1), away from the more familiar k x k x k cubic formats. Our sampling (along with the recent tensor trapdoor one-way functions) makes an enticing case to transition tensor isomorphism cryptography to boundary formats tensors, which are true analogues of square matrices.",

    "abstract": "We present Bitcoin Thunderbolt, a novel off-chain protocol for asynchronous, secure transfer of Bitcoin UTXOs between uncoordinated users. Unlike prior solutions such as payment channels or the Lightning Network, Bitcoin Thunderbolt requires no prior trust, direct interaction, or continuous connectivity between sender and receiver. At its core, Bitcoin Thunderbolt employs a Byzantine fault-tolerant committee to manage threshold Schnorr signatures, enabling secure ownership delegation and on-chain finalization.\r\n\r\nOur design supports recursive, off-chain UTXO transfers using tweakable, verifiable signature components. The protocol tolerates up to $f$ malicious nodes in a $3f+1$ committee and ensures correctness, consistency, and one-time spendability under asynchronous network conditions.\r\n\r\nWe formally verify Bitcoin Thunderbolt\u2019s key security properties, namely, unforgeability, ownership soundness, and liveness\u2014using the Tamarin prover. Our results demonstrate that Thunderbolt provides robust, scalable, and non-interactive off-chain Bitcoin transfers, significantly expanding the practical utility of Bitcoin for decentralized applications.",

    "abstract": "Dependence on online infrastructure is rapidly growing as services like online payments and insurance replace traditional options, while others, like social networks, offer new capabilities. \r\nThe centralized service operators wield unilateral authority over user conflicts, content moderation, and access to essential services.\r\nIn the context of payments, blockchains provide a decentralized alternative. \r\nThey also enable decentralized execution of stateful programs called smart contracts. \r\nBut those lack the contextual understanding and interpretative capabilities that would enable reasoning about complex scenarios.\r\nAdvancements in machine learning (ML) are raising interest in actually-smart contracts, but blockchain computation constraints prohibit direct ML inference execution.\r\nWhile many projects deploy computation delegation mechanisms, they lack Turing-completeness, prohibit parallel computation, or suffer from high overhead.\r\n\r\nWe present Arbigraph, a blockchain-based execution delegation protocol.\r\nLike previous optimistic solutions, the parties submit their computation results, allowing a smart contract to arbitrate in case of dispute.\r\nBut Arbigraph employs a novel dual-graph data structure and takes advantage of the nature of the dispute process to achieve Turing completeness, constant-time memory access, and parallel execution.\r\nWe formalize the problem and show that Arbigraph guarantees completeness, soundness, and progress. \r\nExperiments on LLM inference as well as matrix multiplication, which is at the core of ML inference, demonstrate that parallelization speedup grows linearly with matrix dimensions. \r\nWe demonstrate Arbigraph's practical cost with a deployment on the Avalanche blockchain. \r\nArbigraph thus enables decentralized, context-aware decision-making and unlocks unprecedented use cases for blockchains.",

    "abstract": "Plaintext-ciphertext matrix multiplication (PC-MM) is an indispensable tool in privacy-preserving computations such as secure machine learning and encrypted signal processing. While there are many established algorithms for plaintext-plaintext matrix multiplication, efficiently computing plaintext-ciphertext (and ciphertext-ciphertext) matrix multiplication is an active area of research which has received a lot of attention. Recent literature have explored various techniques for privacy-preserving matrix multiplication using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes with ciphertext packing and Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) processing. On the other hand, there hasn't been any attempt to speed up PC-MM using unpacked additively homomorphic encryption (AHE) schemes beyond the schoolbook method and Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication. In this work, we propose an efficient PC-MM from unpacked AHE, which applies Cussen's compression-reconstruction algorithm for plaintext-plaintext matrix multiplication in the encrypted setting. We experimentally validate our proposed technique using a concrete instantiation with the additively homomorphic elliptic curve ElGamal encryption scheme and its software implementation on a Raspberry Pi 5 edge computing platform. Our proposed approach achieves up to an order of magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art for large matrices with relatively small element bit-widths. Extensive measurement results demonstrate that our fast PC-MM is an excellent candidate for efficient privacy-preserving computation even in resource-constrained environments.",

    "abstract": "A Threshold Fully Homomorphic Encryption (ThFHE) scheme enables the generation of a global public key and secret key shares for multiple parties, allowing any threshold of these parties to collaboratively decrypt a ciphertext without revealing their individual secret keys. By leveraging the homomorphic properties of FHE, this scheme supports the distributed computation of arbitrary functions across multiple parties.  As distributed execution of cryptographic tasks\r\nbecomes popular, the demand for ThFHE schemes grows accordingly. We identify three major challenges with existing solutions. (i) They often take unrealistic assumptions with regards to the network model, assuming the threshold of parties to participate in decryption is known a-priori, available throughout multiple communication rounds, and is consistent between parties. (ii) They incur a super-linear overhead on the underlying FHE public parameters. Both issues pose challenges on scaling with the number of parties. (iii) The require heavyweight Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) during decryption, thereby introducing a significant computational overhead in order to tolerate malicious behavior.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we introduce a \\thfhe scheme that faces the above three challenges simultaneously, and is designed to scale with the number of parties N.\r\n\r\nOur scheme operates within the well-established asynchronous communication model. At the same time, upon decryption, the ciphertext only incurs a linear 3/4N + t additive overhead on the ciphertext modulus size. Additionally, when allowed to rely on none Post Quantum (PQ)-secure additively homomorphic encryption schemes, we provide a method with an O(1) overhead, independent of N. Lastly, we propose a preprocessing technique, that allows the parties to batch and preprocess all necessary ZKPs in an offline phase, before the encrypted inputs and evaluation circuit are determined. In turn, this enables the system to effectively manage traffic spikes, by exploiting idle periods to preform the ZKPs.\r\n\r\nWe build on a ring-based FHE scheme, specifically using the BGV scheme for clarity and concreteness. Nonetheless, the techniques also apply to BFV, CKKS, and TFHE schemes.",

    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) presents unique challenges in programming due to the contrast between traditional and FHE language paradigms. A key challenge is selecting ciphertext configurations (CCs) to achieve the desired level of security, performance, and accuracy simultaneously. Finding the design point satisfying the goal is often labor-intensive (probably impossible), for which reason previous works settle down to a reasonable CC that brings acceptable performance. When FHE is applied to neural networks (NNs), we have observed that the distinct layered architecture of NN models opens the door for a performance improvement by using layer-wise CCs, because a globally chosen CC may not be the best possible CC for every layer individually. This paper introduces LOHEN, a technique crafted to attain high performance of NN inference by enabling to use layer-wise CC efficiently. Empowered with a cryptographic gadget that allows switching between arbitrary CCs, LOHEN allocates layer-wise CCs for individual layers tailored to their structural properties, while minimizing the increased overhead incurred by CC switching with its capability to replace costly FHE operations. LOHEN can also be engineered to attain higher accuracy, yet deliver higher performance compared to state-of-the-art studies, by additionally adopting the multi-scheme techniques in a layer-wise manner. Moreover, the developers using LOHEN are given the capability of customizing the selection policy to adjust the desired levels of performance and accuracy, subject to their demands. Our evaluation shows that LOHEN improves the NN inference performance in both of these cases when compared to the state-of-the-art. When used to improve the CKKS-only inference, LOHEN improves the NN inference performance of various NNs 1.08--2.88x. LOHEN also improves the performance of mixed-scheme NN inference by 1.34--1.75x without accuracy loss. These two results along with other empirical analyses, advocate that LOHEN can widely help improve the performance of NN inference over FHE.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on SM4, a widely used and standardized Chinese block cipher. After revisiting the previously proposed optimal 19-round differential characteristic, we observe that its applicability in differential attacks is limited by a reduced pre-sieving probability, causing the time complexity to exceed that of brute force. To overcome this issue, we employ an automated search approach to identify more promising optimal 19-round differential characteristics. By translating key properties relevant to key recovery into Boolean expressions, we uncover three structural properties common to all optimal 19-round characteristics. While these properties dictate the overall probability of the resulting 19-round distinguishers, their varying pre-sieving probabilities influence their practical effectiveness in differential attacks. Using Boolean encodings, we identify four representative key-recovery-friendly differential characteristics. We then conduct an in-depth analysis of one such characteristic and demonstrate that, when evaluated under both the hypothesis testing paradigm and the key ranking paradigm, the proposed attack requires slightly more data than existing 23-round attacks. Nonetheless, it achieves lower time and memory complexities and ensures a higher success probability, offering a valuable new avenue for differential cryptanalysis of SM4. We believe our findings enhance the understanding of SM4's differential structure and provide a solid foundation for future research on advanced key-recovery techniques that leverage these newly identified structural properties and differential characteristics.",

    "abstract": "The Updatable Signature (US) allows valid signatures to be updated by an update token without accessing the newly generated signing key. Cini et al. (PKC'21) formally defined this signature and gave several constructions. However, their security model requires the secrecy of the update token, which is only applicable in some specific scenarios, such as software verification in the trusted App Store. In Web3, information is usually shared via a public blockchain, and decentralized private computation is expensive. In addition, one can use the same token to update both the signing key and signatures and all signatures can be updated with a single token. The adversarial signature generated by an adversary might also be updated. Therefore, this work explores the (im)possibility of constructing an Updatable Signature with public tokens (USpt), the tokens of which are signature-dependent. Specifically, we define the updatable signature with public tokens and present its security model. Then, we present a concrete USpt scheme based on the Boneh\u2013Lynn\u2013Shacham signature. This variant introduces a limitation for the signer who must maintain a dataset about its signed messages or hashes of them, which is applicable in our applications.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of actively secure two-party machine-learning inference in the preprocessing model, where the parties obtain (input-independent) correlated randomness in an offline phase that they can then use to run an efficient protocol in the (input-dependent) online phase. In this setting, the state-of-the-art is the work of Escudero et al. (Crypto 2020); unfortunately, that protocol requires a large amount of correlated randomness, extensive communication, and many rounds of interaction, which leads to poor performance. \r\nIn this work, we show protocols for this setting based on function secret sharing (FSS) that beat the state-of-the-art in all parameters: they use less correlated randomness and fewer rounds, and require lower communication and computation. We achieve this in part by allowing for a mix of boolean and arithmetic values in FSS-based protocols (something not done in prior work), as well as by relying on \u201cinteractive FSS,\u201d a generalization of FSS we introduce. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach we build SHARK\u2014the first FSS- based system for actively secure inference\u2014which outperforms the state-of-the-art by up to 2300\u00d7.",

    "abstract": "Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (SNARKs) provide a powerful cryptographic framework enabling short, quickly verifiable proofs for computational statements. \r\n\r\nExisting SNARKs primarily target computations represented as arithmetic circuits. However, they become inefficient when handling binary operations, as each gates operates on a few bits while still incurring the cost of multiple field operations per gate. This inefficiency stems, in part, from their inability to capture the word-level operations that are typical in real-world programs. To better reflect this computational pattern, we shift our attention to data-parallel boolean circuits, which serve as a natural abstraction of word-level operations by allowing parallel munipulation of multiple bits. To precisely characterize the prover's overheads in our scheme, we adopt the word RAM model, which aligns with the nature of modern programming languages. Under this model, we propose a novel approach to achieve SNARKs with only sub-linear prover overhead for proving boolean circuits.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, we present an optimized GKR protocol for boolean circuits that captures the word-level operations. To achieve this, we pack multiple bits as a single univariate polynomial, and exploiting the binary nature of circuit values to enable precomputation to accelerate the sumcheck process. This optimization leads to a highly efficient prover requiring only sub-linear RAM operations. Furthermore, we introduce a sub-linear polynomial commitment scheme designed specifically for binary polynomials, which ensures efficient commitments with minimal computational overhead. \r\n\r\nComprehensive evaluations reveal that our scheme achieves both theoretical efficiency and substantial practical performance gains. For instance, in proving randomly generated Boolean circuits with $2^{30}$ gates, proof generation with our optimized GKR protocol completes in just 5.38 seconds, yielding a $223\\times$ speedup over LogUp (Hab\u00f6ck, ePrint 2022), the most efficient known scheme for lookup arguments. Furthermore, in an end-to-end benchmark over the Keccak-$f$ task, our scheme achieves a $106\\times$ speedup compared to Binius (Diamond et al., EUROCRYPT 2025), the state-of-the-art work for boolean circuits.",

    "abstract": "We show that concrete hardness assumptions about learning or cloning the output state of a random quantum circuit can be used as the foundation for secure quantum cryptography. In particular, under these assumptions we construct secure one-way state generators (OWSGs), digital signature schemes, quantum bit commitments, and private key encryption schemes. We also discuss evidence for these hardness assumptions by analyzing the best-known quantum learning algorithms, as well as proving black-box lower bounds for cloning and learning given state preparation oracles.\r\n\r\nOur random circuit-based constructions provide concrete instantiations of quantum cryptographic primitives whose security do not depend on the existence of one-way functions. The use of random circuits in our constructions also opens the door to NISQ-friendly quantum cryptography. We discuss noise tolerant versions of our OWSG and digital signature constructions which can potentially be implementable on noisy quantum computers connected by a quantum network. On the other hand, they are still secure against noiseless quantum adversaries, raising the intriguing possibility of a useful implementation of an end-to-end cryptographic protocol on near-term quantum computers. Finally, our explorations suggest that the rich interconnections between learning theory and cryptography in classical theoretical computer science also extend to the quantum setting.",

    "abstract": "Verifiable computation over encrypted data is gaining increasing attention, and using SNARKs to provide proofs for FHE operations has emerged as a promising approach. However, the mismatch between FHE's typically small prime fields and SNARKs' larger field requirements creates verifiable FHE challenges. In this work, we construct a packed sumcheck algorithm specifically designed for small fields. This approach leverages folding and repetition techniques to maintain security without field expansion, with all operations performed on the base domain. For a domain $\\mathbb{F}_p$ requiring $k$-fold expansion, our sumcheck protocol operates with $(\\log k + l)$ variables, where each sumcheck statement consists of $d$ multiplied multilinear polynomial statements. The prover can complete the computation in $O(kd^2 + k^{1.807}d) \\cdot 2^l$ modular multiplications over $\\mathbb{F}_p$.\r\n\r\nBy exploiting the highly repetitive computational structure in bit-wise FHE bootstrapping operations, we decompose the process into a series of vector operations. Building upon the packed sumcheck technique along with the Brakedown (CRYPTO 2023) and Binius (EUROCRYPT 2025) commitment schemes, we construct an efficient proof system for these vector operations, ultimately yielding a proof system for bit-wise FHE. Our system achieves linear prover time while performing all computations on the base field, resulting in significant improvements in prover efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The large key size for fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) requires substantial costs to generate and transmit the keys. This has been problematic for FHE clients who want to delegate the computation, as they often have limited power. A recent work, Lee-Lee-Kim-No [Asiacrypt 2023], partly solved this problem by suggesting a hierarchical key management system. However, the overall key size was still several gigabytes for real-world applications, and it is barely satisfactory for mobile phones and IoT devices. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose new key management systems, KG+ and BTS+, which reduce the client's cost for FHE on top of Lee-Lee-Kim-No. The KG+system significantly reduces the key size without any compromise in the efficiency of homomorphic computation compared to Lee-Lee-Kim-No. The BTS+ system further reduces the key size, while it compromises only the granularity of the homomorphic computation.\r\n\r\nIn our new systems, the client generates and sends ``transmission keys'' with size-optimal parameters, and the server generates ``evaluation keys'' with computation-optimal parameters. For this purpose, we introduce a new ring-switching technique for keys to bridge keys with different parameters. \r\nUsing the new ring-switching technique, a client can transmit the transmission keys in extension rings that can generate FHE keys in the computation-efficient subring. By decoupling the rings of FHE keys during transmission and computation, we significantly reduce the communication cost for transferring FHE keys. \r\n\r\nWe provide concrete CKKS FHE parameters that the client's keys are $325$--$609$ MB and $285$ MB, by using KG+ and BTS+, respectively. Note that all parameters generate keys for CKKS with ring degree $2^{16}$, which is a conventional choice for CKKS applications to privacy-preserving machine learning. These are $3.09$--$4.37$ and $3.51$--$9.30$ times lower than Lee-Lee-Kim-No, respectively. For real-world applications, the server requires more evaluation keys for faster homomorphic computation. For the secure ResNet-20 inference, the parameters for KG+ and BTS+ result in client key sizes of $325$--$609$ MB and $285$ MB, respectively. These are $3.95$--$5.73\\times$ and $4.53$--$12.25\\times$ smaller than Lee-Lee-Kim-No.",

    "abstract": "Scloud$^{+}$ is a next-generation post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism that combines unstructured-LWE and a ternary key encoding technique to achieve efficient lattice cryptographic operations while eliminating traditional ring structure constraints. Despite its rigorously formalized theoretical security, its practical deployment faces side-channel threats, notably Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) attacks. This paper systematically investigates the physical security of its core ciphertext-key matrix multiplication module by proposing a CPA framework that integrates instruction-level timing analysis. A SoST (Sum of Squared T-values) model, inspired by multi-group Welch's t-test, is used to analyze the Hamming weight leakage during ciphertext loading. At the same time, dynamic sampling windows, combined with processor pipeline modeling, are employed to pinpoint critical leakage intervals. Exploiting the characteristics of ternary keys, an iterative recovery strategy is devised: following a predefined scan order, the candidate set $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ and partial intermediate sums are used to construct a Hamming weight model for hypothesized leakage vectors. Pearson correlation analysis and trace-count stabilization are applied within each dynamic sampling window to determine the optimal estimate for each key element. Experiments targeting 4800 key elements, illustrated through a detailed analysis of the first 32 elements, demonstrate a 100% recovery accuracy with no more than 15 traces per element, indicating high efficiency and stability that can extend to the full key reconstruction. To thwart such CPA attacks, we have further designed and implemented a first\u2010order arithmetic masking countermeasure that splits the original ternary secret key into two subkeys, thereby expanding the attacker's key hypothesis space from $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ to $\\{0, \\ldots, 4095\\}^2$ and significantly enhancing side\u2010channel resilience. Our results demonstrate that Scloud$^{+}$ remains vulnerable to side\u2010channel exploits at the implementation level, highlighting the urgent need to integrate appropriate protections into its standardization process.",

    "abstract": "Truncation of cryptographic outputs is a technique that was recently introduced  in Baldimtsi et al. [BCCK22]. The general idea is to try out many inputs to some cryptographic algorithm until the output (e.g. a public-key or some hash value) falls into some sparse set and thus can be compressed: by trying out an expected $2^k$ different inputs one will find an output that starts with $k$ zeros.\r\n\r\nUsing such truncation one can for example save substantial gas fees on Blockchains where storing values is very expensive. While [BCCK22] show that truncation preserves the security of the underlying primitive, they only consider a setting without preprocessing. In this work we show that lower bounds on the time-space tradeoff for inverting random functions and permutations also hold with truncation, except for parameters ranges where the bound fails to hold for ''trivial'' reasons.\r\n\r\nConcretely, it's known that any algorithm that inverts a random function or permutation with range $N$ making $T$ queries and using $S$ bits of auxiliary input must satisfy $S\\cdot T\\ge N\\log N$. \r\nThis lower bound no longer holds in the truncated setting where one must only invert a challenge from a range of size $N/2^k$, as now one can simply save the replies to all \r\n$N/2^k$ challenges, which requires $S=\\log N\\cdot N /2^k$ bits and allows to invert with $T=1$ query.\r\n\r\nWe show that with truncation, whenever $S$ is somewhat smaller than the $\\log N\\cdot N /2^k$ bits required to store the entire truncated function table, the known $S\\cdot T\\ge N\\log N$ lower bound applies.",

    "abstract": "Data markets play a pivotal role in modern industries by facilitating the exchange of data for predictive modeling, targeted marketing, and research. However, as data becomes a valuable commodity, privacy and security concerns have grown, particularly regarding the personal information of individuals. This tutorial explores privacy and security issues when integrating different data sources in data market platforms. As motivation for the importance of enforcing privacy requirements, we discuss attacks on data markets focusing on membership inference and reconstruction attacks. We also discuss security vulnerabilities in decentralized data marketplaces, including adversarial manipulations by buyers or sellers. We provide an overview of privacy and security mechanisms designed to mitigate these risks. In order to enforce the least amount of trust for buyers and sellers, we focus on distributed protocols. Finally, we conclude with opportunities for future research on understanding and mitigating privacy and security concerns in distributed data markets.",

    "abstract": "Side-channel analysis recovers a secret by exploiting the key-dependent characteristics of the leakages. Practical techniques, such as Distance-of-Means analysis (DoM), Kolmogorov-Smirnov analysis (KSA) and Cram\u00e9r-von Mises analysis (CvMA), provide valuable insights about the secret from the indirect perspectives of statistical moment and cumulative distribution function (CDF) respectively, circumventing the direct and costly estimation of leakage probability densities and therefore enabling wider applicability in practice. Though both the perspectives are informative, their relationships in the context of side-channel analysis remain unclear. In other words, the fundamental questions of \"which one is better?'' and ``why and under what circumstances?\" leave as open problems. In this paper, we introduce the probability-probability (PP) plot in statistics as a common framework for explaining the mathematical foundations of CDF-based techniques, which facilitates an intuitive understanding of different variant strategies. Then, inspired by the growth pattern of the PP curve, we propose a novel distinguisher based on the famous Mann-Kendall test, where measurements are managed with ordinality and nominality. This goodness-of-fit test checks whether a key-dependent binary sequence originates from a random binomial distribution, by efficiently searching potential label clusters. Finally, we explore the symmetry and dual counterpart of CDF in mathematics, introducing the quantile-quantile (QQ) plot and develop an interesting technique based on the inverse cumulative distribution function (ICDF). We present a general discussion of its bridging role, regarding detail capture as well as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). On this basis, we establish the relationships among moment-based, ICDF-based, and CDF-based techniques, which additionally allows for bounding the security level of the CDF-based techniques using well-established metrics that are originally proposed for evaluating the traditional moment-based family. Experiments across various settings validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the two proposed distinguishers.",

    "abstract": "Quantum fire was recently formalized by Bostanci, Nehoran and Zhandry (STOC\u201925). This notion considers a distribution of quantum states that can be efficiently cloned, but cannot be converted into a classical string. Previously, work of Nehoran and Zhandry (ITCS\u201924) showed how to construct quantum fire relative to an inefficient unitary oracle. Later, the work of Bostanci, Nehoran, Zhandry gave a candidate construction based on group action assumptions, and proved the correctness of their scheme; however, even in the classical oracle model they only conjectured the security, and no security proof was given. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we give the first construction of public-key quantum fire relative to a classical oracle, and prove its security unconditionally. This gives the first classical oracle seperation between the two fundamental principles of quantum mechanics that are equivalent in the information-theoretic setting: no-cloning and no-telegraphing. \r\n\r\nGoing further, we introduce a stronger notion called quantum key-fire where the clonable fire states can be used to run a functionality (such as a signing or decryption key), and prove a secure construction relative to a classical oracle. As an application of this notion, we get the first public-key encryption scheme whose secret key is clonable but satisfies unbounded leakage-resilience (Cakan, Goyal, Liu-Zhang, Ribeiro [TCC\u201924]), relative to a classical oracle. Unbounded leakage-resilience is closely related to, and can be seen as a generalization of the notion of no-telegraphing. \r\n\r\nFor all of our constructions, the oracles can be made efficient (i.e. polynomial time), assuming the existence of post-quantum one-way functions",

    "abstract": "Confidential Computing-as-a-Service has gained significant attention in recent years, driven by rapid advances in Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology. Among various architectures, confidential serverless computing has emerged as a promising model. A common approach to designing confidential serverless computing involves decoupling the client workload from the initial enclave image and dynamically provisioning the workload at runtime. This enables both offloading the costly enclave bootstrapping and maintaining a fixed reference measurement for attestation. This decoupling necessitates nested attestation, where the client\u2019s workload is attested via a custom attestation module embedded in a platform-attested enclave established at boot time. The challenge in designing nested attestation, however, is to distinguish fresh enclaves from the used ones to prevent enclave reuse. Specifically, a previously used enclave may be compromised and its attestation module tampered with. If the enclave is reused for another workload, it could bypass runtime attestation, allowing unverified code to execute.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present a novel approach to securing nested attestation for confidential serverless computing on Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX). Unlike prior works, our approach does not rely on intra-enclave isolation techniques to sandbox the client\u2019s workload. Instead, we leverage the Key Separation and Sharing (KSS) feature of Intel SGX to track and prevent enclave reuse based on its immutable IDs. We develop a prototype system for confidential serverless computing for Python workloads, incorporating our nested attestation scheme, and present an empirical evaluation of its performance. \r\n\r\nWe believe our scheme unveils a unique yet previously overlooked role of KSS---post-compromise identification, with broader implications beyond serverless computing. As a concrete example, we demonstrate how KSS can be leveraged to implement an enclave-binding TPM on Intel SGX, which is of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Private information retrieval (PIR) enables a client to retrieve data from a server while preserving the confidentiality of the client's query. When PIR is instantiated with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), the protocol becomes non-interactive, requiring only a query-answer exchange, and it achieves asymptotically optimal communication and computation complexity. Although several FHE-based PIR protocols have been practically implemented with the desired properties, there has been little detailed comparison among them. As a result, it remains unclear which protocol is most efficient in practice with respect to various aspects such as performance and scalability.\r\n\r\n In this paper, we revisit existing protocols by categorizing them into two different structures in order to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each class in detail, with a focus on practical implementations. Furthermore, we introduce and compare various homomorphic algorithms that can be utilized for query optimization, discussing the strengths and limitations of each. Finally, with the goal of identifying the most efficient protocol in terms of computational cost and memory usage, based on database size. Additionally, we address common misconceptions that may lead to inefficient choices in real-world deployment scenarios and offer the best solutions.\r\nConsequently, our analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the less-explored design achieves a 90% reduction in communication cost and an 8\u00d7 decrease in computational overhead compared to the other one, challenging the common misconception.",

Despite significant efforts in the years since, little is known about sponge security against quantum adversaries, even for simple properties like preimage or collision resistance beyond a single round. This is primarily due to the lack of a satisfactory quantum analog of the lazy sampling technique for permutations.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we develop a specialized technique that overcomes this barrier in the case of the sponge. We prove that the sponge is in fact indifferentiable from a random oracle against quantum adversaries. Our result establishes that the domain extension technique behind SHA-3 is secure in the post-quantum setting. Our indifferentiability bound for the sponge is a loose $O(\\mathsf{poly}(q) 2^{-\\min(r, c)/4})$, but we also give bounds on preimage and collision resistance that are tighter.",

    "abstract": "While one-way functions (OWFs) serve as the minimal assumption for computational cryptography in the classical setting, in quantum cryptography, we have even weaker cryptographic assumptions such as pseudo-random states, and EFI pairs, among others. Moreover, the minimal assumption for computational quantum cryptography remains an open question. Recently, it has been shown that pseudoentanglement is necessary for the existence of quantum cryptography (Goul\u00e3o and Elkouss 2024), but no cryptographic construction has been built from it.\r\n\r\n In this work, we study the cryptographic usefulness of quantum pseudoresources \u2014a pair of families of quantum states that exhibit a gap in their resource content yet remain computationally indistinguishable. We show that quantum pseudoresources imply a variant of EFI pairs, which we call EPFI pairs, and that these are equivalent to quantum commitments and thus EFI pairs. Our results suggest that, just as randomness is fundamental to classical cryptography, quantum resources may play a similarly crucial role in the quantum setting.\r\n\r\nFinally, we focus on the specific case of entanglement, analyzing different definitions of pseudoentanglement and their implications for constructing EPFI pairs. Moreover, we propose a new cryptographic functionality that is intrinsically dependent on entanglement as a resource.",

    "abstract": "Safeguarding cryptographic implementations against the increasing threat of Side-Channel Analysis (SCA) attacks is essential. Masking, a countermeasure that randomizes intermediate values, is a cornerstone of such defenses. In particular, SCA-secure implementation of AES, the most-widely used encryption standard, can employ Boolean masking as well as multiplicative masking due to its underlying Galois field operations. However, multiplicative masking is susceptible to vulnerabilities, including the zero-value problem, which has been identified right after theintroduction of multiplicative masking. At CHES 2018, De Meyer et al. proposed a hardware-based approach to manage these challenges and implemented multiplicative masking for AES, incorporating a Kronecker delta function and randomness optimization. \r\nIn this work, we evaluate their design using the PROLEAD evaluation tool under the glitch- and transition-extended probing model. Our findings reveal a critical vulnerability in their first- and second-order implementation of the Kronecker delta function, stemming from the employed randomness optimization. This leakage compromises the security of their presented masked AES Sbox. After pinpointing the source of such a leakage, we propose an alternative randomness optimization for the first-order design to address this issue, and demonstrate its effectiveness through rigorous evaluations by means of PROLEAD.",

    "abstract": "Delegation of quantum computation in a trustful way is one of the most fundamental challenges toward the realization of future quantum cloud computing. While considerable progress has been made, no known protocol provides a purely classical client with universal delegated quantum computation while simultaneously ensuring blindness (input privacy), verifiability (soundness), and robustness against quantum noise\u2014a feat that must be achieved under stringent cryptographic assumptions and with low overhead.\r\n\r\nIn this work, I introduce UVCQC, a new delegation framework that, for the first time, realizes a fully composable protocol for securely delegating quantum computations to an untrusted quantum server from a classical client. My scheme employs trap-based quantum authentication, post-quantum cryptographic commitments, and zero-knowledge proofs to provide full guarantees: the client remains purely classical; the server learns nothing about the computation; and any attempt to deviate from the specified circuit is detected with high probability.\r\n\r\nI rigorously prove completeness, soundness, and perfect blindness of the protocol and demonstrate its universal composability against unbounded quantum adversaries. Furthermore, I propose a thermodynamically inspired verification mechanism based on energy dissipation and entropy change, enabling physically testable verification independent of cryptographic assumptions.\r\n\r\nBeyond its core architecture, UVCQC is deeply intertwined with multidisciplinary frameworks: it admits a game-theoretic formulation where honesty is a Nash equilibrium, an information-theoretic treatment grounded in Holevo bounds, a categorical model via compact closed structures, and novel cryptographic enhancements based on isogeny-based primitives and topological invariants.\r\n\r\nThis research offers a scalable and unified solution to the blind and verifiable delegation problem, pushing forward the theoretical and practical frontiers of secure quantum computation\u2014and opening a tangible path toward trustable quantum cloud services for classical users.",

    "abstract": "Threshold encryption schemes provide a common tool to secure a public-key encryption scheme against single point of failure attacks. Despite the success of lattices in building fully-homomorphic and presumably quantum-resistant encryption schemes, the task of thresholdizing those schemes remains challenging. The major bottleneck in the standard approach is the use of statistical noise flooding, leading to a significant efficiency loss and the need of stronger hardness assumptions. Recent works have replaced the heavy statistical noise flooding by a lighter one using the R\u00e9nyi divergence. The new R\u00e9nyi noise flooding both improves the efficiency and allows to use weaker hardness assumptions. However, arguing semantic security of lattice-based threshold schemes in the presence of R\u00e9nyi noise flooding showed to be challenging. Chowdhury et al. (IACR ePrint'22) argued in the fully-homomorphic case that the R\u00e9nyi divergence directly applies for semantic security by making use of an existing framework called public sampleability.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we argue that their public sampleability framework was neither sufficient nor correctly used. To address both issues, we strengthen the framework and thoroughly apply it to prove semantic security of generic lattice-based threshold encryption constructions. We distinguish between the plain public-key and the fully-homomorphic settings, as different security notions are achieved. As a byproduct, this shows that the proof detour via one-way security made by Boudgoust and Scholl (Asiacrypt'23) was superfluous, now leading to tighter proofs in the standard model.",

In particular, we show how these symmetries allow the computation of theta structures projectively, thus avoiding the use of modular inversions.\r\nFurthermore, we explore the self-similarity of the matrix representation of theta structures, arising from the action of the canonical $2$-torsion point in the Kummer line. Combined with the sparsity of some $4$-torsion points, this structure leads to new formulae for computing gluing $(2,2)$ isogenies that require significantly fewer precomputations and arithmetic operations.\r\nThese new equations also naturally support the evaluation of points on the quadratic twist at a negligible additional cost, without requiring operations in a field extension.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we derive the first lifting theorems for establishing security in the quantum random permutation and ideal cipher models. These theorems relate the success probability of an arbitrary quantum adversary to that of a classical algorithm making only a small number of classical queries.\r\n\r\nBy applying these lifting theorems, we improve previous results and obtain new quantum query complexity bounds and post-quantum security results. Notably, we derive tight bounds for the quantum hardness of the double-sided zero search game and establish the post-quantum security for the preimage resistance, one-wayness, and multi-collision resistance of constant-round sponge, as well as the collision resistance of the Davies-Meyer construction.",

    "abstract": "Sharding is a generic approach to enhance the scalability of distributed systems. In recent years, many efforts have been made to scale the consensus mechanism of blockchains from sharding. A crucial research question is how to achieve the sweet spot of having a relatively small shard size (to achieve decent performance) while achieving an overwhelming probability of correctness (so the system is safe and live). Many recent works fall into the two-layer design that uses some coordinating shards to monitor the correctness of other shards (CCS 2022, NDSS 2024, INFOCOM 2023). All of them involve expensive communication costs between the shards, significantly degrading performance.\r\n\r\nWe present Otter, a scalable partially synchronous sharding-based Byzantine fault-tolerant atomic broadcast (ABC) protocol. We use coordinating shards in a completely new way. In particular, we randomly sample coordinating shards to directly participate in the consensus protocol. Such a random sampling mechanism makes it possible to analyze the correctness of the ABC protocol using a probabilistic model. In this way, we can significantly lower the shard size (informally, from over 1,200 in previous work to around 100) without lowering the probability of correctness. We also present a new notion called abortable fork detection (AFD) that might be of independent interest. Our evaluation results on Amazon EC2 using up to 1,000 replicas show that Otter achieves up to 4.38x the throughput of the state-of-the-art protocol.",

    "abstract": "Differential meet-in-the-middle (MITM) cryptanalysis, introduced by Boura et al. at CRYPTO 2023, has been demonstrated to be an effective technique for analyzing the security of block ciphers. In this paper, we introduce an improved parallel partitioning technique, and incorporate it into a new framework with a flexible key recovery strategy. This framework is applicable to both SPN and Feistel ciphers. We apply the new framework to SIMON and Piccolo-128 for demonstration. In particular, we also develop an MILP-based tool for searching full attacks on Piccolo-128.  For SIMON48/96, we propose the best attack, reaching 26 rounds against 25 rounds previously. For other versions of SIMON, we extend the best previous differential attacks by one or two rounds. In the case of Piccolo-128, while no current differential attacks show promising results, our differential MITM attack reaches 15 rounds, matching the same number of rounds of the best impossible differential attack.",

    "abstract": "As quantum computing matures, its impact on traditional cryptographic protocols becomes increasingly critical, especially for data-at-rest scenarios where large data sets remain encrypted for extended periods of time.\r\nThis paper addresses the pressing need to transition away from pre-quantum algorithms by presenting an agile cryptosystem that securely and efficiently supports post-quantum Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs).\r\nThe proposed solution is based on combining a CCA-secure KEM with a robust Authenticated Encryption scheme, allowing only the dynamic component - the symmetric key encapsulation - to be updated when migrating to new cryptographic algorithms.\r\nThis approach eliminates the need to re-encrypt potentially massive data payloads, resulting in significant savings in computational overhead and bandwidth.\r\nWe formalize the concept of cryptoagility through an agile-CCA security model, which requires that neither the original ciphertext nor any updated version reveals meaningful information to an attacker.\r\nA game-based proof shows that the overall construction remains agile-CCA secure if the underlying KEM and AE are individually CCA secure under a random oracle assumption.\r\nThe result is a future-proof scheme that eases the transition to post-quantum standards, enabling enterprises and cloud storage providers to protect large amounts of data with minimal disruption while proactively mitigating emerging quantum threats.",

So they need establish secure user\u2019s access password to the IS resources of this system via selected authenticated key exchange protocol. So they need  to communicate via insecure communication channel and secretly con-struct a cryptographically strong session key that can serve for the establishment of secure  passwords in the form of tuples in certain alphabet during the certain time interval. Nowadays selected protocol has to be postquantum secure. We propose the implementation of this scheme in terms of Symbolic Computa-tions. The key exchange protocol is one of the key exchange algorithms of Noncommutative Cryptography with the platform of multivariate transformation of the affine space over selected finite commutative ring. The session key is a multivariate map on the affine space.  Platforms and multivariate maps are construct-ed in terms of Algebraic Graph Theory.",

    "abstract": "We were deeply impressed by the paper by Ateniese et al., published in Crypto 2019. In it, they presented a black-box construction of matchmaking encryption (ME) based on functional encryption. In our work, we propose an ME scheme based on standard assumptions in the standard model. This scheme has been proven to be secure under the learning with error (LWE) assumption. Our ME scheme is achieved through a novel framework of bilateral-policy attribute-based encryption (BP-ABE) and a new intermediate primitive termed a perturbed pseudorandom generator (PPRG), which facilitates the implementation of authentication functionality by replacing non-interactive zero-knowledge proof functionality.\r\n\r\nIn the scheme presented in this paper, the user's \"public key\" is generated using Hamming correlation robustness and user attributes. Note that the 'public key' is not public. In order to preserve the privacy of the two parties involved in matchmaking encryption, our BP-ABE scheme does not use the 'public key' directly to encrypt the plaintext. Instead, the message sender selects matching attributes and uses a Hamming correlation robustness and homomorphic pseudorandom function (HPRF) to generate temporary public keys and hide the public key and user attributes.\r\n\r\nWhen these temporary public keys satisfy the access policy, the receiver can decrypt the data using their private key. Regarding the authentication function of matchmaking encryption, this paper proposes a non-interactive privacy set intersection (PSI) scheme based on HPRF and PPRG. The message sender encrypts their 'public key' using the proposed PSI scheme as part of the ciphertext. The receiver also encrypts their 'public key' using the proposed PSI scheme and matches the attributes, thereby completing the message authentication function. We consider our approach to be a significant departure from existing constructions, despite its simplicity.",

    "abstract": "Liquid democracy is a transitive vote delegation mechanism over voting graphs.  It enables each voter to delegate their vote(s) to another better-informed voter, with the goal of collectively making a better decision.\r\nThe question of whether liquid democracy outperforms direct voting has been previously studied in the context of local delegation mechanisms (where voters can only delegate to someone in their neighbourhood) and binary decision problems.  It has previously been shown that it is impossible for local delegation mechanisms to outperform direct voting in general graphs.  This raises the question: for which classes of graphs do local delegation mechanisms yield good results?\r\n\r\nIn this work, we analyse (1) properties of specific graphs and (2) properties of local delegation mechanisms on these graphs, determining where local delegation actually outperforms direct voting.\r\nWe show that a critical graph property enabling liquid democracy is that the voting outcome of local delegation mechanisms preserves a sufficient amount of variance, thereby avoiding situations where delegation falls behind direct voting.\r\nThese insights allow us to prove our main results, namely that there exist local delegation mechanisms that perform no worse and in fact quantitatively better than direct voting in natural graph topologies like complete, random $d$-regular, and bounded degree graphs, lending a more nuanced perspective to previous impossibility results.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces Zemlyanika, a post-quantum IND-CCA secure key encapsulation mechanism based on the Module-LWE problem. The high-level design of Zemlyanika follows a well-known approach where a passively secure public-key encryption scheme is transformed into an actively secure key encapsulation mechanism using the Fujisaki-Okamoto transform. \r\n\r\n    Our scheme features three main elements: a power-of-two modulus, explicit rejection, and revised requirements for decapsulation error probability.\r\n\r\n    The choice of a power-of-two modulus is atypical for Module-LWE based schemes due to the unavailability of Number Theoretic Transform (NTT). However, we argue that this option offers advantages that are often underestimated. We employ explicit rejection because it is more efficient than implicit rejection. Recent works show that both types of rejection are equally secure, so we do not reduce the security by this choice. Finally, we present compelling arguments that the probability of decapsulation failure may be higher than commonly accepted. This allows us to increase performance and security against attacks on the Module-LWE.",

    "abstract": "The Classic McEliece key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), a candidate in the fourth-round post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization process by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), stands out for its conservative design and robust security guarantees. Leveraging the code-based Niederreiter cryptosystem, Classic McEliece delivers high-performance encapsulation and decapsulation, making it well-suited for various applications. However, there has not been a systematic implementation of Classic McEliece on GPU platforms. This paper presents the first high-performance implementation of Classic McEliece on NVIDIA GPUs. Firstly, we present the first GPU-based implementation of Classic McEliece, utilizing a ``CPU-GPU'' heterogeneous approach and a kernel fusion strategy. We significantly reduce global memory accesses, optimizing memory access patterns. This results in encapsulation and decapsulation performance of 28,628,195 ops/s and 3,051,701 ops/s, respectively, for McEliece348864. Secondly, core operations like Additive Fast Fourier Transforms (AFFT), and Transpose AFFT (TAFFT) are optimized. We introduce the concept of the (T)AFFT stepping chain and propose two universal schemes: Memory Access Stepping Strategy (MASS) and Layer-Fused Memory Access Stepping Strategy (LFMASS), which achieve a speedup of 30.56% and 38.37%, respectively, compared to the native \r\nGPU-based McEliece6960119 implementation. Thirdly, extensive experiments on the NVIDIA RTX4090 show significant performance gains, achieving up to 344$\\times$ higher encapsulation and 125$\\times$ higher decapsulation compared to the official CPU-based AVX implementation, decisively outperforming existing ARM Cortex-M4 and FPGA implementations.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computers leverage qubits to solve certain computational problems significantly faster than classical computers. This capability poses a severe threat to traditional cryptographic algorithms, leading to the rise of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) designed to withstand quantum attacks. FALCON, a lattice-based signature algorithm, has been selected by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as part of its post-quantum cryptography standardization process. However, due to the computational complexity of PQC, especially in cloud-based environments, throughput limitations during peak demand periods have become a bottleneck, particularly for FALCON.\r\nIn this paper, we introduce GOLF (GPU-accelerated Optimization for Lattice-based FALCON), a novel GPU-based parallel acceleration framework for FALCON. GOLF includes algorithm porting to the GPU, compatibility modifications, multi-threaded parallelism with distinct data, single-thread optimization for single tasks, and specific enhancements to the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) module within FALCON. Our approach achieves unprecedented performance in FALCON acceleration on GPUs.\r\nOn the NVIDIA RTX 4090, GOLF reaches a signature generation throughput of 42.02 kops/s and a signature verification throughput of 10,311.04 kops/s. These results represent a 58.05$\\times$ / 73.14$\\times$ improvement over the reference FALCON implementation and a 7.17$\\times$ / 3.79$\\times$ improvement compared to the fastest known GPU implementation to date. GOLF demonstrates that GPU acceleration is not only feasible for post-quantum cryptography but also crucial for addressing throughput bottlenecks in real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Secure rate-distortion-perception (RDP) trade-offs arise in critical applications, such as semantic compression and privacy-preserving generative coding, where preserving perceptual quality while minimizing distortion is vital. This paper studies a framework for secure RDP over noiseless and noisy broadcast channels under strong secrecy constraints. We first characterize the exact secure RDP region for noiseless transmission channels. We then develop an inner bound on the secure RDP region for a memoryless broadcast channel with correlated noise components at the receivers' observations and prove its tightness under a more capable broadcast channel assumption. Our results demonstrate how optimized binning schemes simultaneously achieve high perceptual quality, low distortion, and strong secrecy, illuminating fundamental information-theoretic limits for next-generation trustworthy computation systems.",

    "abstract": "Range counting is the problem of preprocessing a set $P\\subset R^d$ of $n$ points, such that given a query range $\\gamma$ we can efficiently compute $|P\\cap\\gamma|$. In the more general range searching problem the goal is to compute $f(P\\cap\\gamma)$, for some function $f$.\r\n\r\nIt was already shown (Kushnir et al. PETS'24) how to efficiently answer a range searching query under FHE using a technique they called Copy-and-Recurse to traverse partition trees.\r\n\r\nIn the Range emptiness problem the goal is to compute only whether $P\\cap\\gamma =\\emptyset$. This was shown (in plaintext) to be done more efficiently.\r\nRange emptiness is interesting on its own and also used as a building block in other algorithms.\r\n\r\nIn this paper we improve and extend the results of Kushnir et al.\r\nFirst, for range searching we reduce the overhead term to the optimal $O(n)$, so for example if the ranges are halfspaces in $R^d$ bounded by hyperplanes then range searching can be done with a circuit of size $O(t\\cdot n^{1-1/d+\\varepsilon}+n)$, where $t$ is the size of the sub-circuit that checks whether a point lies under a hyperplane.\r\n\r\nSecond, we introduce a variation of copy-and-recurse that we call leveled copy-and-recurse. With this variation we improve range searching in the 1-dimensional case as well as traversal of other trees (e.g., binary trees and B-trees). \r\nThird, we show how to answer range emptiness queries under FHE more efficiently than range counting.\r\n\r\nWe implemented our algorithms and show that our techniques for range emptiness yield a solution that is $\\times 3.6$ faster than the previous results for a database of $2^{25}$ points.",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts are integral to decentralized systems like blockchains and enable the automation of processes through programmable conditions. However, their immutability, once deployed, poses challenges when addressing errors or bugs. Existing solutions, such as proxy contracts, facilitate upgrades while preserving application integrity. Yet, proxy contracts bring issues such as storage constraints and proxy selector clashes - along with complex inheritance management. This paper introduces a novel upgradeable smart contract framework with version control, named \"decentraLized vErsion control and updAte manaGement in upgrAdeable smart coNtracts (LEAGAN).\" LEAGAN is the first decentralized updatable smart contract framework that employs data separation with Incremental Hash (IH) and Revision Control System (RCS). It updates multiple contract versions without starting anew for each update, and reduces time complexity, and where RCS optimizes space utilization through differentiated version control. LEAGAN also introduces the first status contract in upgradeable smart contracts, and which reduces overhead while maintaining immutability. In Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) experiments, LEAGAN shows 40\\% better space utilization, 30\\% improved time complexity, and 25\\% lower gas consumption compared to state-of-the-art models. It thus stands as a promising solution for enhancing blockchain system efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Let us assume that one of two trusted parties  (administrator) manages the information system (IS) and another one (user) is going to use the resources of this IS during the certain time interval. So they need establish secure user\u2019s access password to the IS resources of this system via selected authenticated key exchange protocol. So they need  to communicate via insecure communication channel and secretly con-struct a cryptographically strong session key that can serve for the establishment of secure  passwords in the form of tuples in certain alphabet during the certain time interval. Nowadays selected protocol has to be postquantum secure. We propose the implementation of this scheme in terms of Symbolic Computa-tions. The key exchange protocol is one of the key exchange algorithms of Noncommutative Cryptography with the platform of multivariate transformation of the affine space over selected finite commutative ring. The session key is a multivariate map on the affine space.  Platforms and multivariate maps are construct-ed in terms of Algebraic Graph Theory.",

    "abstract": "This work addresses the hintless single-server Private Information Retrieval (PIR) from the perspective of high-level protocol design and introduces PIRCOR and PIRCOR$^{*}$ that outperform the state-of-the-art PIRANA (Liu et. al., IEEE S&P 2024) and YPIR (Menon and  Wu, USENIX Security 2024) in terms of the query size and the query generation time. In PIRCOR, we construct an efficient Rotation-based Expanded Binary Code (REBC) to expand $\\alpha$ primary codewords into $\\beta$ expanded codewords by the Rotation-Mutual-Multiplication operation. By leveraging the innovative REBC, PIRCOR reduces the query size for single-query PIR by a factor of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{\\frac{\\delta-1}{\\delta}}\\right)$ compared to PIRANA, while also avoiding the $\\mathcal{O}(N +\\frac{|\\mathrm{DB}|}{N})$ linear scaling inherent in YPIR ($N$, $\\delta$ and $|\\mathrm{DB}|$ are the (R)LWE secret dimension, the number of codewords with a Hamming weight of $1$ and the number of database elements). Based on PIRCOR, we further present PIRCOR$^{*}$ by additionally introducing the Rotation-self-Multiplication operation, which achieves a $\\mathbf{50\\%}$ reduction in rotation operations and a smaller query size when $\\delta = 2$. \r\n \r\n Building upon PIRCOR and PIRCOR$^{*}$, we further propose their optimized variants, PIRCOR-op and PIRCOR$^{*}$-op, to further reduce the online response time. Similar to YPIR that leverage pre-processing, PIRCOR-op and PIRCOR$^{*}$-op allow all rotations and part of multiplications to be carried out in an offline stage before receiving the query. Additionally, we also design FHE-operator acceleration with leveled optimization and implementation optimization of ciphertext rotation.\r\n \r\nFor 8 KB element retrieval in an 8 GB database, PIRCOR achieves a $\\mathbf{10.7\\times}$ query size reduction compared to PIRANA. When benchmarked against YPIR, the improvements are even more striking: PIRCOR reduces the query size by $\\mathbf{26.8\\times}$ and accelerates query generation by a staggering $\\mathbf{6,080\\times}$. Notably, the enhanced PIRCOR$^{*}$ achieves a $\\mathbf{53.6\\times}$ reduction in query size compared to YPIR, while improving query generation time by an impressive $\\mathbf{12,160\\times}$.",

    "abstract": "Threshold public-key encryption securely distributes private key shares among multiple participants, requiring a minimum number of them to decrypt messages. We introduce a quantum-resistant threshold public-key encryption scheme based on the code-based Niederreiter cryptosystem that achieves security against chosen ciphertext attacks. A previous attempt was made recently by Takahashi, Hashimoto, and Ogata (published at DCC in 2023) but we show that it contains a critical security flaw that allow adversaries to exploit malformed ciphertexts to gain information about the secret key.  \r\n\r\nIn this work, we formalize a generic conversion enhancing security of (classical) public-key encryption from one-wayness against passive attacks to indistinguishability against chosen-ciphertext attacks. The conversion uses a non-interactive zero-knowledge argument with strong security properties to ensure ciphertext well-formedness. We then provide an instantiation for Niederreiter encryption based on recent techniques introduced in the \"MPC-in-the-head\" paradigm. The publicly verifiable validity of ciphertexts makes this scheme suitable for threshold public-key encryption and prevents an attack similar to the one on Takahashi-Hashimoto-Ogata scheme. To improve the multi-party computation protocol for decryption (involving secure computations on polynomials), we introduce a field-switching technique that allows to significantly reduce the shared secret key size and computational overhead.",

    "abstract": "AES-GCM has been the status quo for efficient symmetric encryption for decades. As technology and cryptographic applications evolved over time, AES-GCM has posed some challenges to certain use-cases due to its default 96-bit nonce size, 128-bit block size, and lack of key commitment. Nonce-derived schemes are one way of addressing these challenges: Such schemes derive multiple keys from nonce values, then apply standard AES-GCM with the derived keys (and possibly another 96-bit nonce). The approach overcomes the nonce length and data limit issues since each derived key is only used to encrypt a few messages. By itself, the use of nonce-derived keys does not address key commitment, however. Some schemes chose to include a built-in key commitment mechanism, while others left it out of scope.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we explore efficient key commitment methods that can be added to any nonce-derived scheme in a black-box manner. Our focus is on options that use the underlying block cipher and no other primitive, are efficient, and only use standard primitives which are FIPS-approved. For concreteness we focus here specifically on adding key commitment to XAES-256-GCM, a nonce-scheme originally proposed by Filippo Valsorda, but these methods can be adapted to any other nonce-derived scheme. We propose an efficient CMAC-based key commitment solution, and prove its security in the ideal-cipher model. We argue that adding this solution yields a FIPS-compliant mode, quantify the data and message length limits of this mode and compare this combination to other nonce-derived modes. We also benchmark our key committing XAES-256-GCM performance.",

    "abstract": "It is a widely accepted standard practice to implement cryptographic software so that secret inputs do not influence the cycle count. Software following this paradigm is often referred to as \"constant-time\" software and typically involves following three rules: 1) never branch on a secret-dependent condition, 2) never access memory at a secret-dependent location, and 3) avoid variable-time arithmetic operations on secret data. The third rule requires knowledge about such variable-time arithmetic instructions, or vice versa, which operations are safe to use on secret inputs. For a long time, this knowledge was based on either documentation or microbenchmarks, but critically, there were never any guarantees for future microarchitectures. This changed with the introduction of the data-operand-independent-timing (DOIT) mode on Intel CPUs and, to some extent, the data-independent-timing (DIT) mode on Arm CPUs. Both Intel and Arm document a subset of their respective instruction sets that are intended to leak no information about their inputs through timing, even on future microarchitectures if the CPU is set to run in a dedicated DOIT (or DIT) mode.\r\nIn this paper, we present a principled solution that leverages DOIT to enable cryptographic software that is future-proof constant-time, in the sense that it ensures that only instructions from the DOIT subset are used to operate on secret data, even during speculative execution after a mispredicted branch or function return location. For this solution, we build on top of existing security type systems in the Jasmin framework for high-assurance cryptography.\r\nWe then use our solution to evaluate the extent to which existing cryptographic software built to be \"constant-time\" is already secure in this stricter paradigm implied by DOIT and what the performance impact is to move from constant-time to future-proof constant-time.",

    "abstract": "A group signature scheme enables users of a group to anonymously sign messages on behalf of the group, while a designated authority can revoke anonymity when needed to ensure user accountability. Among group signature schemes,  fully dynamic ones are particularly desirable as they allow new users to join and misbehaved existing users to be revoked without requiring system-wide updates.\r\nThis paper introduces DGSP, a post-quantum fully dynamic group signature scheme that addresses key limitations of existing schemes like DGMT and SPHINX-in-the-Head (SITH). Leveraging the properties of ${\\rm SPHINCS}^+$, DGSP achieves a superior balance between scalability and efficiency by (i) supporting up to $2^{60}$ users, (ii) requiring negligible setup time, and (iii) featuring efficient algorithms with short signatures of constant-size. Notably, while DGMT is limited to $2^{15}$ users, DGSP extends this to $2^{60}$  while keeping signatures compact\u2014only 3.03 to 4.93 times larger than those of DGMT, yet just 0.021 to 0.004 times the size of SITH signatures. This makes DGSP a compelling solution for applications requiring both large-scale user support and signature efficiency in the post-quantum setting. Moreover, DGSP strengthens managerial accountability compared to DGMT by (i) enabling users to verify their certificates generated by the manager and (ii) ensuring public verifiability of the manager's signature attribution. Although SITH claims to support $2^{60}$ users, our analysis reveals that its opening algorithm is highly inefficient, making it impractical to handle such a large number of users. \r\nOur security analysis shows that DGSP achieves unforgeability, anonymity, and traceability in the standard model. We also provide a complete implementation of DGSP. Our experimental study exhibits that DGSP is superior over existing schemes in terms of efficiency and scalability.",

    "abstract": "Reverse firewalls (RFs), introduced by Mironov and Stephens Davidowitz at Eurocrypt 2015, provide a defence mechanism for cryptographic protocols against subversion attacks. In a subversion setting, an adversary compromises the machines of honest parties, enabling the leakage of their secrets through the protocol transcript. Previous research in this area has established robust guarantees, including resistance against data exfiltration for an RF. In this work, we present a new perspective focused on the implementation specifics of RFs. The inherently untrusted nature of RFs exposes their real-world implementations to the risk of Trojan insertion \u2014 an especially pressing issue in today\u2019s outsourced supply chain ecosystem. We argue how Trojan-affected RF implementations can compromise their core exfiltration resistance property, leading to a complete breakdown of the RF\u2019s security guarantees. \r\n\r\nBuilding on this perspective, we propose an enhanced definition for ``Trojan-resilient Reverse Firewalls'' (Tr-RF), incorporating an additional Trojan resilience property. We then present concrete instantiations of Tr-RFs for Coin Tossing (CT) and Oblivious Transfer (OT) protocols, utilizing techniques from Private Circuit III (CCS'16) to convert legacy RFs into Tr-RFs. We also give simulation-based proofs to claim the enhanced security guarantees of our Tr-RF instantiations. Additionally, we offer concrete implementations of our Tr-RF based CT and OT protocols utilizing the Open-Portable Trusted Execution Environment (OP-TEE). Through OP-TEE, we practically realize assumptions made in Private Circuit III that are critical to ensuring Tr-RF security, bridging the gap between theoretical models and real-world applications. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first practical implementation of reverse firewalls for any cryptographic functionality. Our work emphasizes the importance of evaluating protocol specifications within implementation-specific contexts.",

    "abstract": "Mix networks (mixnets) offer robust anonymity even against adversaries monitoring all network links; however, they impose high latency on communications. To address this, recent research has explored strategic low-latency routing within mixnets. While these strategies appear to reduce latency, their impact on mixnet anonymity has not been carefully assessed, raising concerns about potential deanonymization of clients. Tackling this challenge, this paper first quantifies the anonymity loss associated with low-latency routing techniques in mixnets. Building on these insights, second, we introduce a novel low-latency routing method that maintains mixnet anonymity while achieving significant latency reductions compared to the state-of-the-art solution LARMix (NDSS, 2024). Our approach also ensures a more balanced load distribution among mixnet nodes. Moreover, under adversarial conditions where parts of the mixnet are compromised, our method does not confer significant advantages to the adversary, unlike LARMix. Thus, our proposal emerges as the optimal choice for low-latency routing in mixnets. Furthermore, we note that this version expands on both the analytical and experimental results of the previously published paper in NCA 2024, specifically through investigating the anonymity of Loopix-like mixnets.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new method for retrieving the algebraic structure of a generic alternant code given an arbitrary generator matrix, provided certain conditions are met. We then discuss how this challenges the security of the McEliece cryptosystem instantiated with this family of codes. The central object of our work is the quadratic hull related to a linear code, defined as the intersection of all quadrics passing through the columns of a given generator or parity-check matrix, where the columns are considered as points in the affine or projective space. The geometric properties of this object reveal important information about the internal algebraic structure of the code. This is particularly evident in the case of generalized Reed-Solomon codes, whose quadratic hull is deeply linked to a well-known algebraic variety called the rational normal curve. By utilizing the concept of Weil restriction of affine varieties, we demonstrate that the quadratic hull of a generic dual alternant code inherits many interesting features from the rational normal curve, on account of the fact that alternant codes are subfield-subcodes of generalized Reed-Solomon codes. If the rate of the generic alternant code is sufficiently high, this allows us to construct a polynomial-time algorithm for retrieving the underlying generalized Reed-Solomon code from which the alternant code is defined, which leads to an efficient key-recovery attack against the McEliece cryptosystem when instantiated with this class of codes. Finally, we discuss the generalization of this approach to Algebraic-Geometry codes and Goppa codes.",

Existing efforts to accelerate ZKP primarily focus on specific components, such as polynomial commitment schemes or elliptic curve operations, but fail to deliver an integrated, flexible, and efficient end-to-end solution that includes witness generation.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we present ZKPoG, a GPU-based ZKP acceleration platform that achieves full end-to-end optimization. ZKPoG addresses three key challenges: (1) designing a witness-generation-incorporated flow for Plonkish circuits, enabling seamless integration of frontend and backend with GPU acceleration; (2) optimizing memory usage to accommodate large-scale circuits on affordable GPUs with limited memory; and (3) introducing an automated compiler for custom gates, simplifying adaptation to diverse applications. Experimental results on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU show on average $22.8\\times$ end-to-end acceleration compared to state-of-the-art CPU implementations and on average $12.7\\times$ speedup over existing GPU-based approaches.",

    "abstract": "We present conceptually simple constructions of verifiable random functions (VRF) that fulfill strong notions of unbiasability recently introduced by Giunta and Stewart [EC:GS24]. VRFs with such strong properties were previously only known in the random oracle model or from the decisional Diffie\u2013Hellman assumption with preprocessing. In contrast, our constructions are based on generic assumptions and are thus the first to be plausibly post-quantum secure. Moreover, our constructions fulfill several additional properties such as:\r\n\u2022 If the underlying VRF is aggregate, key-homomorphic or computable in \\(\\mathsf{NC}^1\\), then so is our VRF.\r\n\u2022 For any verification key, the VRF output has almost the same min-entropy as the VRF input.\r\nLastly, we outline a path towards a lattice-based VRF (without setup).",

    "abstract": "In recent years, online anonymity has become increasingly important but is under threat due to the challenges of moderating anonymous spaces. A promising cryptographic solution, known as anonymous blocklisting, allows users to post anonymously while still enabling moderation. Moderation via anonymous blocklisting roughly works by requiring that when users post a message they attach a cryptographic proof that they did not author any posts on a \u201cblocklist\u201d. \r\nExisting anonymous blocklisting schemes are unfortunately still far from achieving practical performance for large blocklists. This is essentially due to all prior works requiring a user to (cryptographically) reprocess blocklist entries many times. Relatedly, prior works have relatively high verification times and proof sizes.\r\nIn this work, we introduce ALPACA, the first anonymous blocklisting system with the property that a user only needs to do a constant amount of work per blocklist entry. Thus, our scheme has asymptotically optimal performance. Our scheme is also the first to have verification times and proof sizes that are independent of the number of blocklist entries.\r\nOur key technique is a new variant of incrementally verifiable computation (IVC), designed to ensure anonymity. Along the way, we introduce new definitions to formally establish security. On a mid-range laptop, ALPACA\u2019s proof generation time is always 6.15 seconds and proof size is 25.6KBs. On a server, the verification time is always 400ms.",

    "abstract": "Lattices are the basis of most NIST-recommended post-quantum cryptography (PQC) schemes, required to thwart the threat posed by the eventual construction of large-scale quantum computers. At the same time, lattices enable more advanced cryptographic constructions, such as fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), which is increasingly used for privacy-preserving applications like machine learning. This work delves into the efficiency and trade-off assessment of polynomial multiplication algorithms and their applications to PQC, FHE, and other schemes. Such algorithms are at the core of lattice-based cryptography and may become a critical bottleneck when deploying PQC- and FHE-based solutions on resource-constrained devices. We propose a formal analysis of so-called incompleteness in the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT). Although this concept is not new, our systematization shows how to optimize polynomial multiplication in quotient rings, considering factors such as the degree of incompleteness, the associated prime moduli, constraints of the target platform, and target security level. Besides efficiency, we formally show that the systematized family of incomplete NTT variants supports a larger set of prime moduli. This property enables new trade-offs for algorithms like the FIPS-approved module-lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism (ML-KEM) and faster amortized bootstrapping in FHE schemes. Our results include shorter ciphertexts in ML-KEM with only a modest hit in performance and a 6-42% performance boost in the NTT computation of a state-of-the-art FHE solution.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of how to find the inverse of shift invariant (SI) transformations proposed in Daemen's thesis. In particular, two of them have been used in practice: $y_i=x_i\\oplus \\overline{x_{i+1}}x_{i+2}$ and $y_i=x_i\\oplus \\overline{x_{i+1}}x_{i+2}x_{i+3}$. The first one is the well-known $\\chi$ transformation used in \\textsf{SHA-3}, \\textsf{Subterranean 2.0} and \\textsf{Rasta}, while the second one is used in a recently proposed ZK-friendly hash function called Monolith. While the concrete formula of the inverse of $\\chi$ of arbitrary size has been given and proved by Liu et al. at JoC 2022, it remains unknown how to deduce such a formula and how to systematically study other SI transformations.\r\n    In this work, we aim to provide a general method and flow to find the inverse of SI transformations, though it is still limited to some specific types and it may not work for all such transformations. However, such a general method does shed new insight on how to find their inverse, as we can apply this method to several different SI transformations, including the one used in Monolith. We expect that this method can be further generalized and applied to more SI transformations.",

The notion of verifiable HE (vHE) is introduced to detect malicious server\u2019s behaviors, but current vHE schemes are either more than four orders of magnitude slower than the underlying HE operations (Atapoor et. al, CIC 2024) or fast but incompatible with server- side private inputs (Chatel et. al, CCS 2024).\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose a vHE framework ZHE: effi- cient Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) that prove the correct execution of HE evaluations while protecting the server\u2019s private inputs. More precisely, we first design two new highly- efficient ZKPs for modulo operations and (Inverse) Number Theoretic Transforms (NTTs), two of the basic operations of HE evaluations. Then we build a customized ZKP for HE evaluations, which is scalable, enjoys a fast prover time and has a non-interactive online phase. Our ZKP is applicable to all Ring-LWE based HE schemes, such as BGV and CKKS. Finally, we implement our protocols for both BGV and CKKS and conduct extensive experiments on various HE workloads. Compared to the state-of-the-art works, both of our prover time and verifier time are improved; especially, our prover cost is only roughly 27-36\u00d7 more expensive than the underlying HE operations, this is two to three orders of magnitude cheaper than state-of-the-arts.",

    "abstract": "Differential Fault Attacks (DFAs) have recently emerged as a significant threat against stream ciphers specifically designed for Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption (HHE).\r\nIn this work, we propose DFAs on the $\\textsf{FRAST}$ cipher, which is a cipher specifically tailored for Torus-based Fully Homomorphic Encryption (TFHE). The round function of $\\textsf{FRAST}$ employs random S-boxes to minimize the number of rounds, and can be efficiently evaluated in TFHE. With our specific key recovery strategy, we can mount the DFA with a few faults. Under the assumption of precise fault injection, our DFA can recover the key within one second using just 4 or 6 faults. When discarding the assumption and considering a more practical fault model, we can still achieve key recovery in a few minutes without increasing the number of faults. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first third-party cryptanalysis on $\\textsf{FRAST}$. We also explored countermeasures to protect $\\textsf{FRAST}$. Our analysis revealed that negacyclic S-boxes, a key component of TFHE-friendly ciphers, are unsuitable for incorporating linear structures to resist DFA.  Consequently, we recommend removing the negacyclic restriction in the penultimate round of FRAST and introducing non-zero linear structures into the S-boxes of the last two rounds. We believe that our work will provide valuable insights for the design of TFHE-friendly ciphers.",

    "abstract": "Generic Secure Multiparty Computation (Generic MPC) recently received much attraction in the blockchain realm as it allows mutually distrustful parties to jointly compute a global function using their private inputs while keeping them private; and more so; the expression of the function can be done in a programmable manner (hence `generic'); as opposed to the first rising star cryptographic technique Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) which only allows computation on private input of a single party (via the `commit-and-prove' approach). While ZKP, by nature, allows public verifiability, Generic MPC is not so: Generic MPC mostly focuses on Malicious Security in which the computing result is verifiable only among the computing parties. Yet, in the blockchain realm, public verifiability is important, as the consensus protocol is not just among the computing parties but also external servers. A few works were done to bridge this gap (albeit not in the blockchain realm), i.e., Public Auditable MPC. Public Audtitability is a stronger property than Public Verifiability: the first one certifies the computation done in the MPC, while the latter certifies only the relation between the outputs and the inputs. However, they are non-constant round protocols and only for Secret-Sharing-based MPC, i.e., round complexity scales linearly with the circuit multiplicative depth, while round latency is an important cost metric in the blockchain domain. We address this problem by providing a Public Auditable Garbled Circuit protocol that is maliciously secure, publicly auditable, and constant-round. Our protocol is efficient, with only minimal overhead in terms of round, communication, and public transcript size.",

    "abstract": "At CANS 2024, Zbudila et al. presented MaSTer, a maliciously secure multi-party computation protocol for truncation. It allows adversaries to manipulate outputs with a bounded additive error while avoiding detection with a certain probability. In this work, we analyse the broader implications of adversarial exploitation in probabilistic truncation protocols, specifically in relation to MaSTer. We propose three attack strategies aimed at inducing misclassification in deep neural network (DNN) inference. Our empirical evaluation across multiple datasets demonstrates that while adversarial influence remains negligible under realistic constraints, certain configurations and network architectures exhibit increased vulnerability. By improving the understanding of the risks associated with probabilistic truncation protocols in privacy-preserving machine learning, our work demonstrates that the MaSTer protocol is robust in realistic settings.",

    "abstract": "We propose BLASter, a proof of concept LLL implementation that demonstrates the practicality of multiple theoretical improvements. The implementation uses the segmentation strategy from Neumaier\u2013Stehl\u00e9 (ISSAC 2016), parallelism and Seysen's reduction that was proposed by Kirchner\u2013Espitau\u2013Fouque (CRYPTO 2021) and implemented in OptLLL, and the BLAS library for linear algebra operations. It consists of only 1000 significant lines of C++ and Python code, and is made publicly available.\r\n\r\nFor q-ary lattices that fplll can handle without multiprecision (dimension <180), BLASter is considerably faster than fplll, OptLLL and Ryan\u2013Heninger's flatter (CRYPTO 2023), without degrading output reduction quality. Thanks to Seysen's reduction it can further handle larger dimension without resorting to multiprecision, making it more than 10x faster than flatter and OptLLL, and 100x faster than fplll in dimensions 256 to 1024.\r\n\r\nIt further includes segmented BKZ and segmented deep-LLL variants. The latter provides bases as good as BKZ-15 and has a runtime that is only a couple of times more than our LLL baseline.\r\n\r\nThis remains a proof of concept: the effective use of higher precision \u2014 which is needed to handle \\(\\textit{all}\\) lattices \u2014 has further obstacles and is left for future work. Still, this work contains many lessons learned, and is meant to motivate and guide the development of a robust and modern lattice reduction library, which shall be much faster than fplll.",

    "abstract": "Authenticity-oriented (previously named as privacy-free) garbling\r\nschemes of Frederiksen et al. Eurocrypt \u201915 are designed to satisfy\r\nonly the authenticity criterion of Bellare et al. ACM CCS \u201912, and to be\r\nmore efficient compared to full-fledged garbling schemes. In this work,\r\nwe improve the state-of-the-art authenticity-oriented version of half gates\r\n(HG) garbling of Zahur et al. Crypto \u201915 by allowing it to be bandwidth-free\r\nif any of the input wires of an AND gate is freely settable by the\r\ngarbler. Our full solution AuthOr then successfully combines the ideas\r\nfrom information-theoretical garbling of Kondi and Patra Crypto \u201917 and\r\nthe HG garbling-based scheme that we obtained. AuthOr has a lower\r\ncommunication cost (i.e. garbled circuit or GC size) than HG garbling\r\nwithout any further security assumption. Theoretically, AuthOr\u2019s GC\r\nsize reduction over HG garbling lies in the range between 0 to 100%,\r\nand the exact improvement depends on the circuit structure. We have\r\nimplemented our scheme and conducted tests on various circuits that are\r\nconstructed by independent researchers. Our experimental results show\r\nthat in practice, the GC size gain may be up to roughly 98%.",

    "abstract": "This whitepaper introduces Clementine, a secure, collateral-efficient, trust-minimized, and scalable Bitcoin bridge based on BitVM2 that enables withdrawals from rollups or other side systems to Bitcoin. Clementine proposes a new Bitcoin light client that remains secure against adversaries controlling less than 50% of Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate, assuming at least one honest Watchtower in a permissioned set. The protocol is collateral-efficient, reusing locked funds over time and reducing unnecessary dust outputs through the strategic use of 0-value outputs, and scalable, enabling a single challenge per Operator to slash multiple misbehaviors. This increases throughput and reduces on-chain load without compromising security. Clementine enables trust-minimized and efficient peg-outs from Citrea to Bitcoin, making zk-rollups on Bitcoin practical and unlocking new paths for native scalability and interoperability.",

    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables arbitrary and unlimited computations directly on encrypted data. Notably, the TFHE scheme allows users to encrypt bits or small numbers (4-6 bits) and compute any univariate function using programmable bootstrapping (PBS), while simultaneously refreshing the ciphertext noise. Since both linear and non-linear functions can be evaluated using PBS, it is possible to compute arbitrary functions and circuits of unlimited depth without any accuracy loss. Nevertheless, a major limitation of TFHE, compared to other FHE schemes, is that it operates on a single ciphertext at a time, and the underlying message size remains small. For larger messages with longer bit sizes, the execution overhead of PBS grows exponentially with the number of message bits. A recent approach, called Without-padding PBS (WoPBS), enables computation of much larger lookup tables (10-28 bits), with the execution cost scaling linearly with the number of message bits. The significant encoding mismatch between the PBS and WoPBS, however, complicates the use of both approaches within the same circuit execution.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we introduce novel switching algorithms that enable ciphertexts to be converted back and forth between the PBS and WoPBS contexts without impacting the input noise. Moreover, we introduce a new method to bootstrap ciphertexts within the WoPBS context, allowing for unlimited XOR operations at negligible cost. To enhance runtime, we further introduce optimized parameters for both contexts. We validate our techniques through the homomorphic evaluation of AES encryption and decryption, demonstrating transciphering applications that outperform related works.",

    "abstract": "One-way functions (OWFs) form the foundation of modern cryptography, yet their unconditional existence remains a major open question. In this work, we study this question by exploring its relation to lossy reductions, i.e., reductions $R$ for which it holds that $I(X;R(X)) \\ll n$ for all distributions $X$ over inputs of size $n$.\r\nOur main result is that either OWFs exist or any lossy reduction for any promise problem $\\Pi$ runs in time $2^{\\Omega(\\log\\tau_\\Pi / \\log\\log n)}$, where $\\tau_\\Pi(n)$ is the infimum of the runtime of all (worst-case) solvers of $\\Pi$ on instances of size $n$. More precisely, by having a reduction with a better runtime, for an arbitrary promise problem $\\Pi$, and by using a non-uniform advice, we construct (a family of) OWFs. In fact, our result requires a milder condition, that $R$ is lossy for sparse uniform distributions (which we call mild-lossiness). It also extends to $f$-reductions as long as $f$ is a non-constant permutation-invariant Boolean function, which includes $\\text{And-, Or-, Maj-, Parity-}$, $\\text{Mod}_k$-, and $\\text{Threshold}_k$-reductions.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we show that worst-case to average-case Karp reductions and randomized encodings are special cases of mild-lossy reductions and improve the runtime above as $2^{\\Omega(\\log \\tau_\\Pi)}$ when these mappings are considered. Restricting to weak fine-grained OWFs, this runtime can be further improved as $\\Omega(\\tau_\\Pi)$. \r\nIntuitively, the latter asserts that if weak fine-grained OWFs do not exist then any instance randomization of any $\\Pi$ has the same runtime (up to a constant factor) as the best worst-case solver of $\\Pi$.\r\n\r\nTaking $\\Pi$ as $k\\text{Sat}$, our results provide sufficient conditions under which (fine-grained) OWFs exist assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). Conversely, if (fine-grained) OWFs do not exist, we obtain impossibilities on instance compressions (Harnik and Naor, FOCS 2006) and instance randomizations of $k\\text{Sat}$ under the ETH. \r\nMoreover, the analysis can be adapted to studying such properties of any $\\text{NP}$-complete problem.\r\n\r\nFinally, we partially extend these findings to the quantum setting; the existence of a pure quantum mildly-lossy reduction for $\\Pi$ within the runtime $2^{o(\\log\\tau_\\Pi / \\log\\log n)}$ implies the existence of one-way state generators, where $\\tau_\\Pi$ is defined with respect to quantum solvers.",

    "abstract": "For very long messages, the reliable broadcast protocol  with the best communication complexity to date is the Minicast protocol of Locher & Shoup [2024].  To reliably broadcast a message $m$ to $n$ parties, Minicast has communication complexity $\\sim 1.5 |m| n$, when $|m|$ is large.  However, the round complexity of Minicast is 4, which is worse than the 3 rounds of the classical protocol of Bracha.  We give a new reliable broadcast protocol whose communication complexity is essentially the same as that of Minicast, but whose round complexity is just 3.  Like Minicast, our new protocol does not rely on any cryptography other than hash functions.  We also give a new 2-round protocol that relies on signatures.  For large $|m|$, its communication complexity is also $\\sim 1.5 |m| n$, unless the sender provably misbehaves, in which case its communication complexity may degrade to at most $\\sim 2 |m| n$.",

    "abstract": "In the $k$-Orthogonal Vectors ($k$-OV) problem we are given $k$ sets, each containing $n$ binary vectors of dimension $d=n^{o(1)}$, and our goal is to pick one vector from each set so that at each coordinate at least one vector has a zero. It is a central problem in fine-grained complexity, conjectured to require $n^{k-o(1)}$ time in the worst case.\r\n\r\nWe propose a way to plant a solution among vectors with i.i.d. $p$-biased entries, for appropriately chosen $p$, so that the planted solution is the unique one. Our conjecture is that the resulting $k$-OV instances still require time $n^{k-o(1)}$ to solve, on average.\r\n\r\nOur planted distribution has the property that any subset of strictly less than $k$ vectors has the same marginal distribution as in the model distribution, consisting of i.i.d. $p$-biased random vectors. We use this property to give average-case search-to-decision reductions for $k$-OV.",

    "abstract": "The Augot-Finiasz system is a public-key encryption (PKE) scheme based on Reed-Solomon codes and was later followed by analogous versions in the rank metric. Although these schemes were eventually broken, their fundamental idea remains exciting. Notably, these schemes are significantly different from the McEliece system as there is no need to hide the code and, as such, promise much better parameters. Further, they admit a simple description where both the public key and ciphertext are just corrupted codewords of a public code. An interesting question is whether the general idea can be made to work, i.e., resist all known attacks, by using other code classes. This paper shows how to generalize the Augot-Finiasz system to other code families. We reduce the correctness and security of this framework to simple assertions about the code class with which it is instantiated. Specifically, its correctness is equivalent to the existence of an efficient error-erasure decoder, and its security reduces to an easily understood hardness assumption, called \"supercode decoding\", close to the syndrome decoding problem.",

    "abstract": "The dream of achieving data privacy during external computations has\r\nbecome increasingly concrete in recent years. Indeed, since the early days of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) more than a decade ago, new cryptosystems and techniques have constantly optimized the efficiency of computation on encrypted data.\r\nHowever, one of the main disadvantages of FHE, namely its significant ciphertext expansion factor, remains at the center of the efficiency bottleneck of FHE schemes. To tackle the issue of slow uplink FHE data transmission, we use transciphering. With transciphering, the client naturally encrypts its data under a symmetric scheme and sends them to the server with (once and for all) an FHE encryption of the symmetric scheme\u2019s key. With its larger computing power, the server then evaluates the symmetric scheme\u2019s decryption algorithm within the homomorphic domain to obtain homomorphic ciphertexts that allow it to perform the requested calculations.\r\nSince the first use of this method a bit more than ten years ago, papers on the homomorphic evaluation of AES have been numerous. And as the AES execution is the application chosen by NIST in the FHE part of its recent call for proposals on threshold encryption, the stakes of such work go up another level. But what about other standardized block ciphers? Is the AES the more efficient option? In this work, we leverage on two methods which have successfully been applied to the\r\nhomomorphic evaluation of AES to study several state-of-the-art symmetric block ciphers (namely CLEFIA, PRESENT, PRINCE, SIMON, SKINNY). That is to say, we implement a representative set of symmetric block ciphers using TFHE.\r\nThese implementations allow us to compare the efficiency of this set of symmetric schemes and to categorize them. We highlight the characteristics of block ciphers that are fast to execute in the homomorphic domain and those that are particularly costly.\r\nFinally, this classification of operation types enables us to sketch out what the ideal block cipher for transciphering homomorphic data in integer mode might look like.",

    "abstract": "The power of adaptivity in algorithms has been intensively studied in diverse areas of theoretical computer science. In this paper, we obtain a number of sharp lower bound results which show that adaptivity provides a significant extra power in cryptanalytic time-space tradeoffs with (possibly unlimited) preprocessing time.  \r\n\r\n    Most notably, we consider the discrete logarithm (DLOG) problem in a generic group of $N$ elements. The classical `baby-step giant-step' algorithm for the problem has time complexity $T=O(\\sqrt{N})$, uses $O(\\sqrt{N})$ bits of space (up to logarithmic factors in $N$) and achieves constant success probability.\r\n\r\n    We examine a generalized setting where an algorithm obtains an advice string of $S$ bits and is allowed to make $T$ arbitrary non-adaptive queries that depend on the advice string (but not on the challenge group element for which the DLOG needs to be computed). \r\n    \r\n    We show that in this setting, the $T=O(\\sqrt{N})$ online time complexity of the baby-step giant-step algorithm cannot be improved, unless the advice string is more than $\\Omega(\\sqrt{N})$ bits long. This lies in stark contrast with the classical adaptive Pollard's rho algorithm for DLOG, which can exploit preprocessing to obtain the tradeoff curve $ST^2=O(N)$. We obtain similar sharp lower bounds for the problem of breaking the Even-Mansour cryptosystem in symmetric-key cryptography and for several other problems. \r\n    \r\n    To obtain our results, we present a new model that allows analyzing non-adaptive preprocessing algorithms for a wide array of search and decision problems in a unified way. \r\n    \r\n    Since previous proof techniques inherently cannot distinguish between adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms for the problems in our model, they cannot be used to obtain our results. Consequently, we rely on information-theoretic tools for handling distributions and functions over the space $S_N$ of permutations of $N$ elements. Specifically, we use a variant of Shearer's lemma for this setting, due to Barthe, Cordero-Erausquin, Ledoux, and Maurey (2011), and a variant of the concentration inequality of Gavinsky, Lovett, Saks and Srinivasan (2015) for read-$k$ families of functions, that we derive from it. This seems to be the first time a variant of Shearer's lemma for permutations is used in an algorithmic context, and it is expected to be useful in other lower bound arguments.",

    "abstract": "Authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) schemes are responsible for securing increasingly critical digital infrastructures, worldwide. Unfortunately, current widely deployed schemes suffer from various limitations that make them difficult to use securely in practice. For example, schemes like AES-GCM limit the amount of data that can be encrypted with a single key,  therefore limiting its secure scaling to modern workloads. At the same time, practitioners may not be able to move away from the use of AES-GCM due to mature and widely deployed implementations, legacy constraints, and compliance. \r\n \r\nIn this paper, we provide approaches to improve the secure scaling of AEAD schemes via what we call derived-nonce, derived-key (DNDK) transforms. At a high level, such transforms use a root key to derive a nonce and key for use with an underlying scheme. The challenge is doing so in a way that introduces as little overhead as possible, and relying on a small number of assumptions on the used primitives. We provide some general results about secure scaling transforms and a concrete design for AES-GCM that is called DNDK-GCM. It requires as little as three additional AES calls to enable use of the same key to encrypt up to $2^{64}$ bytes of data, even when using random nonces. We also provide a detailed performance analysis. DNDK-GCM is now a draft IETF standard, and is already deployed at the cloud scale by companies including Meta.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present an efficient secure multi-party computation MPC protocol that provides strong security guarantees in settings with a dishonest majority of participants who may behave arbitrarily. Unlike the popular MPC implementation known as SPDZ [Crypto \u201912], which only ensures security with abort, our protocol achieves both complete identifiability and robustness. With complete identifiability, honest parties can detect and unanimously agree on the identity of any malicious party. Robustness allows the protocol to continue with the computation without requiring a restart, even when malicious behavior is detected. Additionally, our approach addresses the performance limitations observed in the protocol by Cunningham et al. [ICITS \u201917], which, while achieving complete identifiability, is hindered by the costly exponentiation operations required by the choice of commitment scheme.\r\n\r\nOur protocol is based on the approach by Rivinius et al. [S&P \u201922], utilizing lattice-based commitment for better efficiency. We achieves robustness with the help of a semi-honest trusted third party. We benchmark our robust protocol, showing the efficient recovery from parties\u2019 malicious behavior.\r\n\r\nFinally, we benchmark our protocol on a ML-as-a-service scenario, wherein clients off-load the desired computation to the servers, and verify the computation result. We benchmark on linear ML inference, running on various datasets. While our efficiency is slightly lower compared to SPDZ\u2019s, we offer stronger security properties that provide distinct advantages.",

    "abstract": "We put forth a new paradigm for practical secure multiparty computation (MPC) in the preprocessing model, where a feasible one-time setup can enable a lifetime of efficient online secure computations. \r\nOur protocols match the security guarantees and low costs of the cheapest category of MPC solutions, namely 3-party protocols (3PC) secure against a single malicious party, with the qualitative advantages that one party communicates data sublinear in the circuit size, and can go offline after its initial messages. This \"2+1\"-party structure can alternatively be instantiated between 2 parties with the aid of a (possibly untrusted) dealer. Within such existing protocols, we provide comparable online performance while improving the storage and offline dealer-to-party communication requirements by more than 3 orders of magnitude. \r\n\r\nAt the technical level, we build on a novel combination of the Fully Linear Interactive Oracle Proof (FLIOP)-based protocol design of Boyle et al. (CRYPTO 2021) and pseudorandom correlation generators. We provide an extensive assortment of algorithmic and implementation-level optimizations, design efficient distributed proofs of well-formedness of complex FLIOP correlations, and make them circuit-independent. We implement and benchmark our end-to-end system against the state of the art in the $(2+1)$ regime, a dealer-aided variant of SPDZ for Boolean circuits.\r\n\r\nWe additionally extend our techniques to the $(n+1)$ party setting, where a dealer aids general dishonest-majority MPC, and provide a variant of the protocol which further achieves security with identifiable abort.",

    "abstract": "An identity-based ring signature (IRS) is an attractive cryptographic primitive having numerous applications including e-cash and e-voting, that enables a user to authenticate sensitive documents on behalf of a ring of user identities chosen by the signer and provides anonymity and unforgeability. We introduce the first quantum-tokenized identity-based ring signature (QTIRS) scheme qtIRS and its variant D-qtIRS with signature delegation assuming the existence of obfuscated membership-checking circuits and a computationally sound non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proof system. We emphasize that our schemes are dynamic where a user can join or leave the system without disturbing others, allow unrestricted ring size with signature size independent of the ring size and provide security in the standard model. We enhance our security framework by minimizing restrictions for the adversary and allowing a broader domain to forge and introduce the notion of strong existential unforgeability against adaptive-chosen-message-and-identity attack (sEU-ACMI) and strong anonymity (sAnon). Our scheme qtIRS achieves sEU-ACMI and sAnon security while our scheme D-qtIRS attains strong existential unforgeability against adaptive-chosen-message-and-identity attack with signature delegation (sEU-ACMID) and sAnon. Most interestingly, our D-qtIRS features signature delegation and leased key revocation in the IRS setting, enabling a lessor to grant a limited signing authority to a lessee and revoke the delegated authority whenever needed. Additionally, we have shown the existence of obfuscated membership-checking circuits which is of independent interest.",

Although MPC has advanced significantly and attracts a growing industry interest, open-source implementations are still at an early stage, with no production-ready code and a poor understanding of their actual security guarantees.\r\nIn this work, we study the real-world security of modern MPC implementations, focusing on the SPDZ protocol (Damg\u00e5rd et al., CRYPTO 2012, ESORICS 2013), which provides security against malicious adversaries when all-but-one of the participants may be corrupted. We identify a novel type of MAC key leakage in the MAC check protocol of SPDZ, which can be exploited in concurrent, multi-threaded settings, compromising output integrity and, in some cases, input privacy. In our analysis of three SPDZ implementations (MP-SPDZ, SCALE-MAMBA, and FRESCO), two are vulnerable to this attack, while we also uncover further issues and vulnerabilities with all implementations. We propose mitigation strategies and some recommendations for researchers, developers and users, which we hope can bring more awareness to these issues and avoid them reoccurring in future.",

    "abstract": "Multi-party private set union (mPSU) allows multiple parties to compute the union of their private input sets without revealing any additional information. \r\nExisting efficient mPSU protocols can be categorized into symmetric key encryption (SKE)-based and public key encryption (PKE)-based approaches. However, neither type of mPSU protocol scales efficiently to a large number of parties, as they fail to fully utilize available computational resources, leaving participants idle during various stages of the protocol execution.\r\n\r\nThis work examines the limitation of existing protocols and proposes a unified framework for designing efficient mPSU protocols.  We then introduce an efficient Parallel mPSU for Large-Scale Entities (PULSE) that enables parallel computation, allowing all parties/entities to perform computations without idle time, leading to significant efficiency improvements, particularly as the number of parties increases.  Our protocol is based on PKE and secure even when up to $n-1$ semi-honest parties are corrupted. We implemented PULSE and compared it to state-of-the-art mPSU protocols under different settings, showing a speedup of $1.91$ to $3.57\\times$ for $n=8$ parties for various set sizes.",

    "abstract": "AES has cemented its position as the primary symmetric-key primitive for a wide range of cryptographic applications, which motivates the analysis on the concrete security of AES's instantiations in practice, for instance, the collision resistance of AES-based hashing, the key commitment security of AES-based authenticated encryption schemes, and the one-wayness of AES-based one-way functions in ZK and MPC protocols. In this work, we introduce single-color initial structures into meet-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, a systematic technique to identify attack trails that enable efficient neutral word generation and low-memory attacks. As a result, we have attained: (1) the first classical one-block collision attack on 7-round AES-MMO/MP, marking the first advancement in attack rounds for more than a decade and matching the attack rounds in the quantum setting; (2) the first one-block collision attack on 4-round AES-128-DM, which bridges the gap in Taiyama et al.'s claim at Asiacrypt 2024 from an MITM perspective; (3) the first improvement in single known plaintext key recovery attack on 5-round AES-128 in over a decade; (4) comprehensive results on the security margin of Rijndael-192 and Rijndael-256 in multiple instantiations. These breakthroughs deepen our understanding of AES-like structure, and contribute as a scrutiny of the security of AES-based instantiations.",

However, due to a lack of public documentation and source code, the specific security guarantees it provides are unclear. Seeking to rectify this situation, we combine the limited public documentation with information we gather through reverse-engineering its implementation to provide a formal description of the subset of WhatsApp that provides multi-device group messaging. We utilise this description to state and prove the security guarantees that this subset of WhatsApp provides. Our analysis is performed within a variant of the Device-Oriented Group Messaging model, which we extend to support device revocation.

    "abstract": "NTRU schemes have been extensively studied as post-quantum proposals within the category of lattice-based constructions.\r\nNumerous designs have been introduced with security assumptions based on the NTRU hard problem; some focused on security, and others were motivated by faster computations. Recently, some proposals for noncommutative NTRU have appeared in the literature, claiming more resistance to some algebraic attacks. While these proposals provide practical cryptosystems, they fail to perform similarly to the original NTRU over the ring of integers. This work introduces the first construction of noncommutative NTRU that matches the speed of NTRU over the ring of integers.\r\nAdditionally, we present another construction over the ring of Eisenstein integers, demonstrating that performance can be further enhanced. We comprehensively implement the Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) based on our constructions and compare their efficiency and compactness to both commutative and noncommutative NTRU variants in the literature. Our findings indicate that the new designs provide competitive memory and time requirements while utilizing noncommutative algebra. For example, our noncommutative KEM based on the twisted dihedral group ring over the ring of integers achieves encapsulation and decapsulation speeds comparable to NTRU-HPS, with a key generation speed that is 2.5 times faster. Additionally, our construction based on the ring of Eisenstein integers is at least 1.6 times faster for key generation and 1.3 times faster for both encapsulation and decapsulation compared to NTRU-HPS.",

    "abstract": "The Matrix Equivalence Digital Signature (MEDS) scheme a code-based candidate in the first round of NIST\u2019s Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization process, offers competitively small signature sizes but incurs high computational costs for signing and verification. This work explores how a high-performance FPGA-based hardware implementation can enhance MEDS performance by leveraging the inherent parallelism of its computations, while examining the trade-offs between performance gains and resource costs. This work in particular proposes a unified hardware architecture capable of efficiently performing both signing and verification operations within a single combined design. The architecture jointly supports all security parameters, including the dynamic, run-time handling of different prime fields without the need to re-configure the FPGA. This work also evaluates the resource overhead of supporting different prime fields in a single design, which is relevant not only for MEDS but also for other cryptographic schemes requiring similar flexibility. This work demonstrates that custom hardware for PQC signature schemes can flexibly support different prime fields with limited resource overhead. For example, for NIST security Level I, our implementation achieves signing times of 4.5 ms to 65.2 ms and verification times of 4.2 ms to 64.5 ms utilizing 22k to 72k LUTs and 66 to 273 DSPs depending on design variant and optimization goal.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring code integrity in browser-based applications remains a longstanding challenge exacerbated by the complexity of modern web environments. We propose Web-based Code Assurance and Transparency, a novel code integrity verification and enforcement mechanism that prevents the execution of unverified code, unlike previous approaches premised on user-visible error indicators or permissive failure modes. WEBCAT remains compatible with modern web features, uses existing cryptographic components without reinventing primitives or requiring expensive infrastructure, and provides verifiable logs of all system components, even under degraded operational conditions. It follows a separation-of-concerns model in which hosting providers require no special trust or cryptographic keys to deploy developer-signed applications, reflecting real-world deployment scenarios in which trusted applications may be served by multiple less-trusted hosts.\r\n \r\nWe evaluate our approach by porting Jitsi, GlobaLeaks, Element, CryptPad, Standard Notes, and Bitwarden, demonstrating compatibility across a diverse set of applications. Benchmark results indicate an overhead of up to 2% for non-enrolled domains on cold starts and up to 20% for enrolled ones. Under warm start conditions, the overhead reaches 25% for enrolled domains and 5% for non-enrolled ones\u2014lower than previous methods while addressing a larger threat model and remaining compatible with existing applications.",

    "abstract": "Fault injection attacks represent a class of threats that can compromise embedded systems across multiple layers of abstraction, such as system software, instruction set architecture (ISA), microarchitecture, and physical implementation. Early detection of these vulnerabilities and understanding their root causes, along with their propagation from the physical layer to the system software, is critical in securing the cyberinfrastructure. \r\nThis work presents a comprehensive methodology for conducting controlled fault injection attacks at the pre-silicon level and an analysis of the underlying system for root-causing behavior. As the driving application, we use the clock glitch attacks in AI/ML applications for critical misclassification. Our study aims to characterize and diagnose the impact of faults within the RISC-V instruction set and pipeline stages, while tracing fault propagation from the circuit level to the AI/ML application software. This analysis resulted in discovering two new vulnerabilities through controlled clock glitch parameters. First, we reveal a novel method for causing instruction skips, thereby preventing the loading of critical values from memory. This can cause disruption and affect program continuity and correctness. Second, we demonstrate an attack that converts legal instructions into illegal ones, thereby diverting control flow in a manner exploitable by attackers. Our work underscores the complexity of fault injection attack exploits and emphasizes the importance of preemptive security analysis.",

    "abstract": "Masking is one of the most prevalent and investigated countermeasures against side-channel analysis. As an alternative to the simple (e.g., additive) encoding function of Boolean masking, a collection of more algebraically complex masking types has emerged. Recently, inner product masking and the more generic code-based masking have proven to enable higher theoretical security properties than Boolean masking. In CARDIS 2017, Poussier et al. connected this ``security order amplification'' effect to the bit-probing model, demonstrating that for the same shared size, sharings from more complex encoding functions exhibit greater resistance to higher-order attacks. Despite these advantages, masked gadgets designed for code-based implementations face significant overhead compared to Boolean masking. Furthermore, existing code-based masked gadgets are not designed for efficient bitslice representation, which is highly beneficial for software implementations. Thus, current code-based masked gadgets are constrained to operate over words (e.g., elements in $\\mathbb{F}_{2^k}$), limiting their applicability to ciphers where the S-box can be efficiently computed via power functions, such as AES. In this paper, we address the aforementioned limitations. We first introduce foundational masked linear and non-linear circuits that operate over bits of code-based sharings, ensuring composability and preserving bit-probing security, specifically achieving $t$-Probe Isolating Non-Interference ($t$-PINI). Utilizing these circuits, we construct masked ciphers that operate over bits, preserving the security order amplification effect during computation. Additionally, we present an optimized bitsliced masked assembly implementation of the SKINNY cipher, which outperforms Boolean masking in terms of randomness and gate count. The third-order security of this implementation is formally proven and validated through practical side-channel leakage evaluations on a Cortex-M4 core, confirming its robustness against leakages up to one million traces.",

    "abstract": "The conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS) setting is among the most basic primitives studied in information-theoretic cryptography.  Motivated by a connection to non-local quantum computation and position-based cryptography, CDS with quantum resources has recently been considered. Here, we study the differences between quantum and classical CDS, with the aims of clarifying the power of quantum resources in information-theoretic cryptography. We establish the following results:\r\n\r\n1) For perfectly correct CDS, we give a separation for a promise version of the not-equals function, showing a quantum upper bound of $O(\\log n)$ and classical lower bound of $\\Omega(n)$. \r\n\r\n2) We prove a $\\Omega(\\log \\mathsf{R}_{0,A\\rightarrow B}(f)+\\log \\mathsf{R}_{0,B\\rightarrow A}(f))$ lower bound on quantum CDS where $\\mathsf{R}_{0,A\\rightarrow B}(f)$ is the classical one-way communication complexity with perfect correctness. \r\n\r\n3) We prove a lower bound on quantum CDS in terms of two round, public coin, two-prover interactive proofs.\r\n\r\n4) We give a logarithmic upper bound for quantum CDS on forrelation, while the best known classical algorithm is linear. We interpret this as preliminary evidence that classical and quantum CDS are separated even with correctness and security error allowed. \r\n\r\nWe also give a separation for classical and quantum private simultaneous message passing for a partial function, improving on an earlier relational separation. Our results use novel combinations of techniques from non-local quantum computation and communication complexity.",

    "abstract": "Many user-centric applications face a common privacy problem: the need to collect, store, and analyze sensitive user data. Examples include check-in/check-out based payment systems for public transportation, charging/discharging electric vehicle batteries in smart grids, coalition loyalty programs, behavior-based car insurance, and more. We propose and evaluate a generic solution to this problem. More specifically, we provide a formal framework integrating privacy-preserving data collection, storage, and analysis, which can be used for many different application scenarios, present an instantiation, and perform an experimental evaluation of its practicality.\r\n\r\nWe consider a setting where multiple operators (e.g., different mobility providers, different car manufacturers and insurance companies), who do not fully trust each other, intend to maintain and analyze data produced by the union of their user sets. The data is collected in an anonymous (wrt.\\ all operators) but authenticated way and stored in so-called user logbooks. In order for the operators to be able to perform analyses at any time without requiring user interaction, the logbooks are kept on the operator's side. Consequently, this potentially sensitive data must be protected from unauthorized access. To achieve this, we combine several selected cryptographic techniques, such as threshold signatures and oblivious RAM. The latter ensures that user anonymity is protected even against memory access pattern attacks.\r\n\r\nTo the best of our knowledge, we provide and evaluate the first generic framework that combines data collection, operator-side data storage, and data analysis in a privacy-preserving manner, while providing a formal security model, a UC-secure protocol, and a full implementation. With three operators, our implementation can handle over two million new logbook entries per day.",

    "abstract": "Classic McEliece is one of the code-based Key Encapsulation Mechanism finalists in the ongoing NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization process. Several key-recovery side-channel attacks on the decapsulation algorithm have already been published. However none of them discusses the feasibility and/or efficiency of the attack in the case of noisy side-channel acquisitions. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing two improvements on the recent key-recovery attack published by Dr\u0103goi et al.. First, we introduce an error correction algorithm for the lists of Hamming weights obtained by side-channel measurements, based on the assumption, validated experimentally, that the error on a recovered Hamming weight is bounded to $\\pm1$. We then offer a comparison between two decoding efficiency metrics, the theoretical minimal error correction capability and an empirical average correction probability. We show that the minimal error correction capability, widely used for linear codes, is not suitable for the (non-linear) code formed by the lists of Hamming weights. Conversely, experimental results show that out of 1 million random erroneous lists of $2t=128$ Hamming weights, only 2 could not be corrected by the proposed algorithm. This shows that the probability of successfully decoding a list of erroneous Hamming weights is very high, regardless of the error weight. In addition to this algorithm, we describe how the secret Goppa polynomial $g$, recovered during the first step of the attack, can be exploited to reduce both the time and space complexity of recovering the secret permuted support $\\mathcal{L}$.",

    "abstract": "Decentralized governance plays a critical role in blockchain communities, allowing stakeholders to shape the evolution of platforms such as Cardano, Gitcoin, Aragon, and MakerDAO through distributed voting on proposed projects in order to support the most beneficial of them. In this context, numerous voting protocols for decentralized decision-making have been developed, enabling secure and verifiable voting on individual projects (proposals). However, these protocols are not designed to support more advanced models such as quadratic voting (QV), where the voting power, defined as the square root of a voter\u2019s stake, must be distributed among the selected by voter projects. Simply executing multiple instances of a single-choice voting scheme in parallel is insufficient, as it can not enforce correct voting power splitting. To address this, we propose an efficient blockchain-based voting protocol that supports liquid democracy under the QV model, while ensuring voter privacy, fairness and verifiability of the voting results. In our scheme, voters can delegate their votes to trusted representatives (delegates), while having the ability to distribute their voting power across selected projects. We model our protocol in the Universal Composability framework and formally prove its UC-security under the Decisional Diffie\u2013Hellman (DDH) assumption. To evaluate the performance of our protocol, we developed a prototype implementation and conducted performance testing. The results show that the size and processing time of a delegate\u2019s ballot scale linearly with the number of projects, while a voter\u2019s ballot scales linearly with both the number of projects and the number of available delegation options. In a representative setting with 64 voters, 128 delegates and 128 projects, the overall traffic amounts to approximately 2.7 MB per voted project, confirming the practicality of our protocol for modern blockchain-based governance systems.",

    "abstract": "Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) are peer-to-peer protocols that serve as building blocks for more advanced applications. Recent examples, motivated by blockchains, include decentralized storage networks (e.g., IPFS), data availability sampling, or Ethereum's peer discovery protocol.\r\n\r\nIn the blockchain context, DHTs are vulnerable to Sybil attacks, where an adversary compromises the network by joining with many malicious nodes. Mitigating such attacks requires restricting the adversary's ability to create a lot of Sybil nodes. Surprisingly, the above applications take no such measures. Seemingly, existing techniques are unsuitable for the proposed applications.\r\n\r\nFor example, a simple technique proposed in the literature uses proof of work (PoW), where nodes periodically challenge their peers to solve computational challenges. This, however, does not work well in practice. Since the above applications do not require honest nodes to have a lot of computational power, challenges cannot be too difficult. Thus, even moderately powerful hardware can sustain many Sybil nodes.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we investigate using Proof of Space (PoSp) to limit the number of Sybils DHTs. While PoW proves that a node wastes computation, PoSp proves that a node wastes disk space. This aligns better with the resource requirements of the above applications. Many of them are related to storage and ask honest nodes to contribute a substantial amount of disk space to ensure the application's functionality.\r\n\r\nWith this synergy in mind, we propose a mechanism to limit Sybils where honest nodes dedicate a fraction of their disk space to PoSp. This guarantees that the adversary cannot control a constant fraction of all DHT nodes unless it provides a constant fraction of whole the disk space contributed to the application in total. Since this is typically a significant amount, attacks become economically expensive.",

    "abstract": "There is rising interest in combining Differential Privacy (DP) and Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) techniques to protect distributed database query evaluations from both adversaries taking part in the computation and those observing the outputs. This requires implementing both the query evaluation and noise generation parts of a DP mechanism directly in MPC. While query evaluation can be done using existing highly optimized MPC techniques for secure function evaluation, efficiently generating the correct noise distribution is a more novel challenge. \r\n    Due to the inherent nonlinearity of sampling algorithms for common noise distributions, this challenge is quite non-trivial, as is evident from the substantial number of works proposing protocols for multiparty noise sampling. In this work, we propose a new approach for joint noise sampling that leverages recent advances in multiparty lookup table (LUT) evaluations. The construction we propose is largely agnostic to the target noise distribution and builds on obliviously evaluating the LUT at an index drawn from a distribution that can be very cheaply generated in MPC, thus translating this cheap distribution into the much more complicated target noise distribution. In our instantiation, the index is a concatenation of cheaply biased bits, and we approximate a discrete Laplace distribution to a negligible statistical distance. We demonstrate the concrete efficiency of the construction by implementing it using 3-party replicated secret sharing (RSS) in the honest-majority setting with both semi-honest and malicious security. In particular, we achieve sub-kilobyte communication complexity, being an improvement over the state-of-the-art by several orders of magnitude and a computation time of a few milliseconds. Samples of a discrete Laplace distribution are generated with (amortized over $1000$ samples) 362 bytes of communication and under a millisecond computation time per party in the semi-honest setting. Using recent results for batched multiplication checking, we have an overhead for malicious security that, per sample, amortizes to below a byte of communication and 10 ms of runtime.\r\n    Finally, our open-source implementation extends the online-to-total communication trade-off for MAESTRO-style lookup tables which might be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Delay- and Disruption-tolerant Networks (DTNs) enable communication in challenging environments like space and underwater. Despite the need for secure communication, key management remains an unresolved challenge in DTNs.\r\nBoth DTN security protocols, BSP and BPSec, explicitly exclude key management from their scope, and research in this area remains limited. Traditional Internet-based key management methods are largely unsuitable due to the unique constraints of DTNs. In this paper, we present BERMUDA, a BPSec-compatible key management framework for unicast messaging. Our approach combines established building blocks, including a hierarchical PKI and ECDH, with an adapted version of NOVOMODO for certificate revocation. To evaluate its applicability, we implement a DTN chat application as an example use case and analyze the system's scalability. While our findings demonstrate the feasibility of BERMUDA for DTNs, we also show limitations related to scalability and computational load in resource-constrained scenarios. By bridging the gap between conceptual designs and practical deployment, this work advances key management research in DTNs, contributing to secure communication in these demanding networks.",

    "abstract": "Attribute-based encryption (ABE) enables fine-grained access control but traditionally depends on a central authority to issue decryption keys. Key-policy registered ABE removes this trust assumption by letting users generate their own keys and register public keys with an untrusted curator, who aggregates them into a compact master public key for encryption.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose a black-box construction of key-policy registered attribute-based encryption from lattice assumptions in the standard model. Technically, our starting point is the registration-based encryption scheme by D\u00f6ttling et al. (Eurocrypt, 2023). Building on this foundation, we incorporate the public-coin evasive learning with errors (LWE) assumption and the tensor LWE assumption introduced by Wee (Eurocrypt, 2022) to construct a registered ABE scheme that supports arbitrary bounded-depth circuit policies. Compared to prior private-coin approaches, our scheme is based on more intuitive and transparent security assumptions. Furthermore, the entire construction relies solely on standard lattice-based homomorphic evaluation techniques, without relying on other expensive cryptographic primitives. The scheme also enjoys scalability: the sizes of the master public key, helper decryption key and ciphertext grow polylogarithmically with the number of users. Each user's key pair remains succinct, with both the public and secret keys depending solely on the security parameter and the circuit depth.",

    "abstract": "Attribute-based encryption can be considered a generalization of public key encryption, enabling fine-grained access control over\r\nencrypted data using predetermined access policies. In general, we distinguish between key-policy and ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption schemes. Our new scheme is built upon the multi-authority\r\nattribute-based encryption with an honest-but-curious central authority\r\nscheme in a key-policy setting presented earlier by Bo\u017eovi\u0107 et al., and it\r\ncan be considered an extension of their scheme. In their paper, trust was\r\nshared between the central authority and the participating authorities,\r\nwho were responsible for issuing attribute-specific secret keys. The central authority was not capable of decrypting any message as long as there\r\nexists an honest attribute authority. In our new scheme, we maintain this\r\nfeature, and add another level of security by allowing users to participate\r\nin the key generation process and contribute to the final user-specific attribute secret keys. Users gain more control over their own secret keys,\r\nand they will be the only parties with access to the final user-specific\r\nsecret keys. Furthermore, no secure channels, only authenticated communication channels are needed between users and authorities. After the\r\nmodifications our scheme will be closer to the registered multi-authority\r\nattribute-based encryption. We refer to our scheme as a partially registered type of multi-authority attribute-based encryption scheme. We\r\nprove the security of our scheme in the Selective-ID model.",

    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows computations on encrypted data without revealing any information about the data itself. However, FHE ciphertexts include noise for security reasons, which increases during operations and can lead to decryption errors. This paper addresses the noise introduced during bootstrapping in Torus Fully Homomorphic Encryption (TFHE), particularly focusing on approximation errors during modulus switching and gadget decomposition. We propose a mean compensation technique that removes the mean term from the noise equations, achieving up to a twofold reduction in noise variance. This method can be combined with bootstrap key unrolling for further noise reduction. Mean compensation can reduce the error probability of a standard parameter set from $2^{-64.30}$ to $2^{-100.47}$, or allows the selection of more efficient parameters leading to a speedup of bootstrapping up to a factor $2.14\\times$.",

    "abstract": "SPDZ-style and BMR-style protocols are widely known as practical MPC protocols that achieve active security in the dishonest majority setting.  However, to date, SPDZ-style protocols have not achieved constant rounds, and BMR-style protocols have struggled to achieve scalable communication or computation.  Additionally, there exists fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)-based MPC protocols that achieve both constant rounds and scalable communication, but they face challenges in achieving active security in the dishonest majority setting and are considered impractical due to computational inefficiencies.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose an MPC framework that constructs an efficient and scalable FHE-based MPC protocol by integrating a linear secret sharing scheme (LSSS)-based MPC and FHE. The resulting FHE-based MPC protocol achieves active security in the dishonest majority setting and constant complexity in online communication, computation per gate, rounds, and private input size. Notably, when instantiated with the SPDZ protocol and gate FHE for the framework, the resulting FHE-based MPC protocol efficiently achieves active security in the dishonest majority setting by using SPDZ-style MAC and ensures the computation per gate time within 3 ms. Moreover, its offline phase achieves scalable communication and computation, both of which grow linearly with the number of parties $n$. In other words, the proposed FHE-based MPC preserves the key advantages of existing FHE-based MPCs and simultaneously overcomes the weaknesses of them. As a result, the proposed FHE-based MPC is a highly practical and secure like SPDZ-style and BMR-style protocols.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, we introduce the concept of circuit-privacy, which ensures that external adversaries who eavesdrop on communications do not obtain information about the circuit. We rigorously prove that our construction inherently satisfy circuit- privacy, thereby establishing a novel security option for MPC.",

    "abstract": "Passports, identity cards and travel visas are examples of machine readable travel documents (MRTDs) or eMRTDs for their electronic variants. The security of the data exchanged between these documents and a reader is secured with a standardized password authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocol known as PACE.\r\n\r\nA new world-wide protocol migration is expected with the arrival of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standards. In this paper, we focus on the impact of this migration on constrained embedded devices as used in eMRTDs. We present a feasibility study of a candidate post-quantum secure PAKE scheme as the replacement for PACE on existing widely deployed resource-constrained chips. In a wider context, we study the size, performance and security impact of adding post-quantum cryptography with a focus on chip storage and certificate chains for existing eMRTDs.\r\n\r\nWe show that if the required post-quantum certificates for the eMRTD fit in memory, the migration of existing eMRTD protocols to their post-quantum secure equivalent is already feasible but a performance penalty has to be paid. When using a resource constrained SmartMX3 P71D600 smart card, designed with classical cryptography in mind, then execution times of a post-quantum secure PAKE algorithm using the recommended post-quantum parameter of the new PQC standard ML-KEM can be done in under a second. This migration will be aided by future inclusion of dedicated hardware accelerators and increased memory to allow storage of larger keys and improve performance.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce HydraProofs, the first vector commitment (VC) scheme that achieves the following two properties. (i) The prover can produce all the opening proofs for different elements (or consecutive sub-arrays) for a vector of size N in optimal time O(N). (ii) It is directly compatible with a family of zkSNARKs that encode their input as a multi-linear polynomial, i.e., our VC can be directly used when running the zkSNARK on its pre-image, without the need to open'' the entire vector pre-image inside the zkSNARK. To the best of our knowledge, all prior VC schemes either achieve (i) but are not efficiently pluggable'' into zkSNARKs (e.g., a Merkle tree commitment that requires re-computing the entire hash tree inside the circuit), or achieve (ii) but take (NlogN) time. We then combine HydraProofs with the seminal GKR protocol and apply the resulting zkSNARK in a setting where multiple users participate in a computation executed by an untrusted server and each user wants to ensure the correctness of the result and that her data was included. Our experimental evaluation shows our approach outperforms prior ones by 4-16x for prover times on general circuits. Finally, we consider two concrete application use cases, verifiable secret sharing and verifiable robust aggregation. For the former, our construction achieves the first scheme for Shamir's secret sharing with linear time prover (lower than the time needed for the dealer computation). For the second we propose a scheme that works against misbehaving aggregators and our experiments show it can be reasonably deployed in existing schemes with minimal slow-downs.",

    "abstract": "Arithmetization-Oriented (AO) symmetric primitives play an important role in the efficiency and security of zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems. The design and cryptanalysis of AO symmetric-key primitives is a new topic particularly focusing on algebraic aspects. An efficient AO hash function aims at lowering the multiplicative complexity in the arithmetic circuit of the hash function over a suitable finite field. The AO hash function Anemoi was proposed in CRYPTO 2023.   \r\n\r\nIn this work we present an in-depth Groebner basis (GB) cryptanalysis of Anemoi over GF(p). The main aim of any GB cryptanalysis is to obtain a well-structured set of polynomials representing the target primitive, and finally solve this system of polynomials using an efficient algorithm.\r\n\r\nWe propose a new polynomial modelling for Anemoi that we call ACICO. We show that using ACICO one can obtain a GB defined by a well-structured set of polynomials. Moreover, by utilising ACICO we can prove the exact complexity of the Groebner basis computation (w.r.t Buchberger's algorithm) in the cryptanalysis of Anemoi. The structured GB further allows us to prove the dimension of the quotient space which was conjectured in a recently published work. \r\nAfterwards, we provide the complexity analysis for computing the variety (or the solutions) of the GB polynomial system (corresponding to Anemoi) which is the final step in GB cryptanalysis, by using known approaches. In particular, we show that GB polynomial structure allows us to use the Wiedemann algorithm and improve the efficiency of cryptanalysis compared to previous works.\r\n\r\nOur GB cryptanalysis is applicable to more than two branches (a parameter in Anemoi), while the previously published results showed cryptanalysis only for two branches. Our complexity analysis implies that the security of Anemoi should not be relied upon the GB computation.\r\n\r\nWe also address an important mathematical question in GB cryptanalysis of Anemoi namely, does the Anemoi polynomial system has a Shape form?, positively. By proving this we guarantee that upon application of basis conversion method like FGLM one can obtain a convenient system of polynomials that is easy to solve.",

    "abstract": "Key derivation functions can be used to derive variable-length random strings that serve as cryptographic keys. They are integral to many widely-used communication protocols such as TLS, IPsec and Signal. NIST SP 800-108 specifies several key derivation functions based on pseudorandom functions such as \\mode{CMAC} and \\mode{HMAC}, that can be used to derive additional keys from an existing cryptographic key. This standard either explicitly or implicitly requests their KDFs to be variable output length pseudorandom function, collision resistant, and preimage resistant. Yet, since the publication of this standard dating back to the year of 2008, until now, there is no formal analysis to justify these security properties of KDFs. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we give the formal security analysis of key derivation functions in NIST SP 800-108. We show both positive and negative results regarding these key derivation functions. For KCTR-CMAC, KFB-CMAC, and KDPL-CMAC that are key derivation functions based on CMAC in counter mode, feedback mode, and double-pipeline mode respectively, we prove that all of them are secure variable output length pseudorandom functions and preimage resistance. We show that KFB-CMAC and KDPL-CMAC are collision resistance. While for KCTR-CMAC, we can mount collision attack against it that requires only six block cipher queries and can succeed with probability 1/4. For KCTR-HMAC, KFB-HMAC, and KDPL-HMAC that are key derivation functions based on HMAC in modes, we show that all of them behave like variable output length pseudorandom functions. When the key of these key derivation functions is of variable length, they suffer from collision attacks. For the case when the key of these key derivation function is of fixed length and less than $d-1$ bits where $d$ is the input block size of the underlying compression function, we can prove that they are collision resistant and preimage resistant.",

    "abstract": "Most practical synchronous Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols, such as Sync HotStuff (S&P 2020), follow the convention of partially synchronous BFT and adopt a deterministic design. Indeed, while these protocols achieve O(n) time complexity, they exhibit impressive performance in failure-free scenarios. \r\n\r\nThis paper challenges this conventional wisdom, showing that a randomized paradigm terminating in expected O(1) time may well outperform prior ones even in the failure-free scenarios. Our framework reduces synchronous BFT to a new primitive called multi-valued Byzantine agreement with strong external validity (MBA-SEV). Inspired by the external validity property of multi-valued validated Byzantine agreement (MVBA), the additional validity properties allow us to build a BFT protocol where replicas agree on the hashes of the blocks. Our instantiation of the paradigm, Sonic, achieves O(n) amortized message complexity per block proposal, expected O(1) time, and enables a fast path of only two communication step. \r\n\r\nOur evaluation results using up to 91 instances on Amazon EC2 show that the peak throughput of Sonic and P-Sonic (a pipelining variant of Sonic) is 2.24x-14.52x and 3.08x-24.25x that of Sync HotStuff, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The literature on computational differential privacy (CDP) has focused almost exclusively on definitions that are computational analogs of `pure' $(\\epsilon,0)$-DP. We initiate the formal study of computational versions of approximate DP, i.e. $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP with non-negligible $\\delta$. We focus on IND-CDP and SIM$_{\\forall\\exists}$-CDP and show that the hierarchy between them when $\\delta > 0$ potentially differs substantially from when $\\delta = 0$. In one direction, we show that for $\\delta < 1$, any mechanism which is $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-SIM$_{\\forall\\exists}$-CDP also is $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-IND-CDP, but only if $\\epsilon$ is logarithmic in the security parameter. As a special case, this proves that the existing implication from $(\\epsilon,0)$-SIM$_{\\forall\\exists}$-CDP to $(\\epsilon,0)$-IND-CDP does not hold for arbitrary $\\epsilon$, as previously claimed. Furthermore, we prove that when the parameters are the same in IND-CDP and SIM$_{\\forall\\exists}$-CDP and $\\epsilon$ is superlogarithmic, there exists a natural task that can be solved whilst satisfying SIM$_{\\forall\\exists}$-CDP but which no IND-CDP mechanism can solve. This is the first separation in the CDP literature which is not due to using a task contrived specifically in order to give rise to the separation. \r\n    In the other direction, we show that the techniques for establishing an implication from $(\\epsilon,0)$-IND-CDP to $(\\epsilon,0)$-SIM$_{\\forall\\exists}$-CDP extend only to that a mechanism being $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-IND-CDP implies it is also $(\\epsilon,\\delta')$-SIM$_{\\forall\\exists}$-CDP with $\\delta' > \\delta$. Finally, we show that the Groce-Katz-Yerukhimovich barrier results against separations between CDP and statistical DP hold also in the setting of non-negligible $\\delta$.",

In its TCP variant, ADNL secures communication\r\nbetween clients and specialized nodes called liteservers, which\r\nprovide access to blockchain data. We identify two crypto-\r\ngraphic design flaws in this protocol: a handshake that permits\r\nsession-key replay and a non-standard integrity mechanism\r\nwhose security critically depends on message confidentiality.\r\nWe transform these vulnerabilities into an efficient plaintext-\r\nrecovery attack by exploiting two ADNL communication pat-\r\nterns, allowing message reordering across replayed sessions.\r\nWe then develop a plaintext model for this scenario and con-\r\nstruct an efficient algorithm that recovers the keystream using\r\na fraction of known plaintexts and a handful of replays. We\r\nimplement our attack and show that an attacker intercepting\r\nthe communication between a TON liteserver and a widely de-\r\nployed ADNL client can recover the keystream used to encrypt\r\nserver responses by performing eight connection replays to the\r\nserver. This allows the decryption of sensitive data, such as\r\naccount balances and user activity patterns.

    "abstract": "Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocols are fundamental components of threshold cryptography, enabling key generation in a trustless manner for a range of cryptographic operations such as threshold encryption and signing. Of particular widespread use are DKG protocols for discrete-logarithm based cryptosystems. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we present a comprehensive analysis of existing DKG protocols in the discrete-logarithm setting, with the goal of identifying cryptographic techniques and design principles that facilitate the development of secure and resilient protocols. To offer a structured overview of the literature, we adopt a modular approach and classify DKG protocols based on their underlying network assumption and cryptographic tools. These two factors determine how DKG protocols manage secret sharing and reach consensus as their essential building blocks. We also highlight various insights and suggest future research directions that could drive further advancements in this area.",

    "abstract": "The Fiat-Shamir transform is one of the most widely applied methods for secure signature construction. Fiat-Shamir starts with an interactive zero-knowledge identification protocol and transforms this via a hash function into a non-interactive signature. The protocol's zero-knowledge property ensures that a signature does not leak information on its secret key $\\mathbf s$, which is achieved by blinding $\\mathbf s$ via proper randomness $\\mathbf y$.\r\nMost prominent Fiat-Shamir examples are DSA signatures and the new post-quantum standard Dilithium.\r\n\r\nIn practice, DSA signatures have experienced fatal attacks via leakage of a few bits of the randomness $\\mathbf y$ per signature.\r\nSimilar attacks now emerge for lattice-based signatures, such as Dilithium.\r\n\r\nWe build on, improve and generalize the pioneering leakage attack on Dilithium by Liu, Zhou, Sun, Wang, Zhang, and Ming.\r\nIn theory, their original attack can recover a 256-dimensional subkey of Dilithium-II (aka ML-DSA-44) from leakage in a single bit of $\\mathbf{y}$ per signature, in any bit position $j \\geq 6$.\r\nHowever, the memory requirement of their attack grows exponentially in the bit position $j$ of the leak.\r\nAs a consequence, if the bit leak is in a high-order position, then their attack is infeasible.\r\n\r\nIn our improved attack, we introduce a novel transformation, that allows us to get rid of the exponential memory requirement.\r\nThereby, we make the attack feasible for $all$ bit positions $j \\geq 6$.\r\nFurthermore, our novel transformation significantly reduces the number of required signatures in the attack.\r\n\r\nThe attack applies more generally to all Fiat-Shamir-type lattice-based signatures.\r\nFor a signature scheme based on module LWE over an $\\ell$-dimensional module, the attack uses a 1-bit leak per signature to efficiently recover a $\\frac{1}{\\ell}$-fraction of the secret key.\r\nIn the ring LWE setting, which can be seen as module LWE with $\\ell = 1$, the attack thus recovers the whole key. \r\nFor Dilithium-II, which uses $\\ell = 4$, knowledge of a $\\frac{1}{4}$-fraction of the 1024-dimensional secret key lets its security estimate drop significantly from $128$ to $84$ bits.",

We identify an abstract criterion common to all their policy classes which suffices to present the construction in a fully black-box way and allows for a slight strengthening of the supported policy classes. The construction of Pointcheval et al. is based on pairings. We additionally provide a new lattice-based instantiation from (public-coin) evasive LWE.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we revisit existing constructions for policies that can be viewed as a conjunction of local policies (one per encryptor). Existing constructions from MDDH (Agrawal et al., CRYPTO 2023) and LWE (Francati et al., EUROCRYPT 2023) do not support encryption w.r.t. different labels. We show how this feature can be included. Notably, the security model of Francati et al. additionally guarantees attribute-hiding but does not capture collusions. Our new construction is also attribute-hiding and provides resilience against any polynomially bounded number of collusions which must be fixed at the time of setup.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, the notion of semi-regular sequences, originally proposed by Fr\u00f6berg, becomes very important not only in Mathematics, but also in Information Science, in particular Cryptology.  For example, it is highly expected that randomly generated polynomials form a semi-regular sequence, and based on this observation, secure cryptosystems based on polynomial systems can be devised. In this paper, we deal with a semi regular sequence and its variant, named a generalized cryptographic semi-regular sequence, and give precise analysis on the complexity of computing a Gr\u00f6bner basis of the ideal generated by such a sequence with help of several regularities of the ideal related to Lazard's bound on maximal Gr\u00f6bner basis degree and other bounds. We also study the genericness of the property that a sequence is semi-regular, and its variants related to Fr\u00f6berg's conjecture. Moreover, we discuss on the genericness of another important property that the initial ideal is weakly reverse lexicographic, related to Moreno-Soc\u00edas' conjecture, and show some criteria to examine whether both Fr\u00f6berg's conjecture and Moreno-Soc\u00edas' one hold at the same time.",

    "abstract": "Sampling from non-uniform randomness according to an algorithm which keeps the internal randomness used by the sampler hidden is increasingly important for cryptographic applications, such as timing-attack-resistant lattice-based cryptography or certified differential privacy. In this paper we present a provably efficient sampler that maintains random sample privacy, or random sample hiding, and is applicable to arbitrary discrete random variables. Namely, we present a constant-time version of the classic Knuth-Yao algorithm that we name \"trimmed-tree\" Knuth-Yao. We establish distribution-tailored Boolean circuit complexity bounds for this algorithm, in contrast to the previous naive distribution-agnostic bounds. For a $\\sigma^2$-sub-Gaussian discrete distribution where $b_t$ is the number of bits for representing the domain, and $b_p$ is the bits for precision of the PDF values, we prove the Boolean circuit complexity of the trimmed-tree Knuth-Yao algorithm has upper bound $O(\\sigma b_p^{3/2} b_t)$, an exponential improvement over the naive bounds, and in certain parameter regimes establish the lower bound $\\widetilde{\\Omega}( ( \\sigma + b_p ) b_t )$. Moreover, by proving the subtrees in the trimmed-tree Knuth-Yao circuit are small, we prove it can computed by running $b_p$ circuits of size $O(\\sigma b_p^{1/2} b_t)$ in parallel and then running $O(b_p b_t )$ sequential operations on the output. We apply these circuits for trimmed-tree Knuth-Yao to constructing random variable commitment schemes for arbitrary discrete distributions, giving exponential improvements in the number of random bits and circuit complexity used for certified differentially private means and counting queries over large datasets and domains.",

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been a growing interest in anonymous credentials (ACs) as they can mitigate the risk of personal data being processed by untrusted actors without consent and beyond the user's control. Furthermore, due to the privacy-by-design paradigm of ACs, they can prove possession of personal attributes, such as an authenticated government document containing sensitive personal information, while preserving the privacy of the individual by not actually revealing the data. Typically, AC specifications consider the privacy of individuals during the presentation of an AC, but often neglect privacy-preserving approaches for enhanced security features such as AC non-duplication or AC revocation. To achieve more privacy-friendly enhanced security features of non-duplication and privacy-preserving revocation, an AC can be partially stored on secure, trusted hardware and linked to a status credential that reflects its revocation status.\r\nIn this paper, we specify an AC system that satisfies the requirements of minimality of information, unlinkability, non-duplication, and privacy-preserving revocation.\r\nThis is achieved by adapting the hardware binding method of the Direct Anonymous Attestation protocol with the BBS+ short group signatures of Camenisch et al. and combining it with status credentials.",

    "abstract": "Byzantine Agreement (BA) allows $n$ processes to propose input values to reach consensus on a common, valid $L_o$-bit value, even in the presence of up to $t < n$ faulty processes that can deviate arbitrarily from the protocol. Although strategies like randomization, adaptiveness, and batching have been extensively explored to mitigate the inherent limitations of one-shot agreement tasks, there has been limited progress on achieving good amortized performance for multi-shot agreement, despite its obvious relevance to long-lived functionalities such as state machine replication. \r\n\r\nObserving that a weak form of accountability suffices to identify and exclude malicious processes, we propose new efficient and deterministic multi-shot agreement protocols for multi-value validated Byzantine agreement (MVBA) with a strong unanimity validity property (SMVBA) and interactive consistency (IC). Specifically, let $\\kappa$ represent the size of the cryptographic objects needed to solve Byzantine agreement when $n<3t$. We achieve both IC and SMVBA with $O(1)$ amortized latency, with a bounded number of slower instances.  The SMVBA protocol has $O(nL_o +n\\kappa)$ amortized communication and the IC has  $O(nL_o + n^2\\kappa)$ amortized communication. For input values larger than $\\kappa$, our protocols are asymptotically optimal. These results mark a substantial improvement\u2014up to a linear factor, depending on $L_o$\u2014over prior results. To the best of our knowledge, the present paper is the first to achieve the long-term goal of implementing a state machine replication abstraction of a distributed service that is just as fast and efficient as its centralized version, but with greater robustness and availability.",

    "abstract": "Private set union (PSU) allows two parties to compute the union of their sets without revealing anything else. It can be categorized into balanced and unbalanced scenarios depending on the size of the set on both sides. Recently, Jia et al. (USENIX Security 2024) highlight that existing scalable PSU solutions suffer from during-execution leakage and propose a PSU with enhanced security for the balanced setting. However, their protocol's complexity is superlinear with the size of the set. Thus, the problem of constructing a linear enhanced PSU remains open, and no unbalanced enhanced PSU exists. In this work, we address these two open problems: \r\n\r\n-Balanced case: We propose the first linear enhanced PSU. Compared to the state-of-the-art enhanced PSU (Jia et al., USENIX Security 2024), our protocol achieves a $2.2 - 8.8\\times$ reduction in communication cost and a $1.2 - 8.6\\times$ speedup in running time, depending on set sizes and network environments. \r\n\r\n-Unbalanced case: We present the first unbalanced enhanced PSU, which achieves sublinear communication complexity in the size of the large set. Experimental results demonstrate that the larger the difference between the two set sizes, the better our protocol performs. For unbalanced set sizes $(2^{10},2^{20})$ with single thread in $1$Mbps bandwidth, our protocol requires only $2.322$ MB of communication. Compared with the state-of-the-art enhanced PSU, there is $38.1\\times$ shrink in communication and roughly $17.6\\times$ speedup in the running time.",

    "abstract": "Threshold ECDSA schemes distribute the capability of issuing signatures to multiple parties. They have been used in practical MPC wallets holding cryptocurrencies. However, most prior protocols are not robust, wherein even one misbehaving or non-responsive party would mandate an abort. Robust schemes have been proposed (Wong et al., NDSS \u201923, \u201924), but they do not match state-of-the-art number of rounds which is only three (Doerner et al., S&P \u201924). In this work, we propose robust threshold ECDSA schemes RompSig-Q and RompSig-L that each take three rounds (two of which are broadcasts). Building on the works of Wong et al. and\r\nfurther optimized towards saving bandwidth, they respectively take each signer (1.0\ud835\udc61 + 1.6) KiB and 3.0 KiB outbound broadcast communication, and thus exhibit bandwidth efficiency that is competitive in practical scenarios where broadcasts are natively handled. RompSig-Q preprocesses multiplications and features fast online signing; RompSig-L leverages threshold CL encryption for scalability and dynamic participation.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in maliciously secure garbling have significantly improved the efficiency of constant-round multi-party computation. Research in the field has primarily focused on reducing communication complexity through row reduction techniques and improvements to the preprocessing phase with the use of simpler correlations.\r\nIn this work, we present two contributions to reduce the communication complexity of state of the art multi-party garbling with an arbitrary number of corruptions. First, we show how to achieve full row reduction for $n$-party garbled circuits in HSS17-style protocols (Hazay et al., Asiacrypt'17 & JC'20) and authenticated garbling (Yang et al., CCS'20), reducing the size of the garbled circuit by 25% from $4n\\kappa$ to $3n\\kappa$ and from $(4n-6)\\kappa$ to $3(n-1)\\kappa$ bits per AND gate, respectively. Achieving row reduction in multi-party garbling has been an open problem which was partly addressed by the work of Yang et al. for authenticated garbling. In our work, we show a full row reduction for both garbling approaches, thus addressing this open problem completely.\r\nSecond, drawing inspiration from the work of Dittmer et al. (Crypto 2022), we propose a new preprocessing protocol to obtain the required materials for the garbling phase using large field triples that can be generated with sublinear communication. The new preprocessing significantly reduces the communication overhead of garbled circuits. Our optimizations result in up to a $6\\times$ reduction in communication compared to HSS17 and a $2.2\\times$ reduction over the state of the art authenticated garbling of Yang et al. for 3 parties in a circuit with 10 million AND gates.",

    "abstract": "The isogeny-based post-quantum digital signature algorithm SQIsign offers the most compact key and signature sizes among all candidates in the ongoing NIST call for additional post-quantum signature algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first Simple Power Analysis (SPA) side-channel attack on SQIsign, demonstrating its feasibility for key recovery.\r\nOur attack specifically targets secret-dependent computations within Cornacchia's algorithm, a fundamental component of SQIsign's quaternion module. At the core of this algorithm, a secret-derived yet ephemeral exponent is used in a modular exponentiation subroutine. By performing SPA on the modular exponentiation, we successfully recover this ephemeral exponent. We then develop a method to show how this leaked exponent can be exploited to ultimately reconstruct the secret signing key of SQIsign.\r\nOur findings emphasize the critical need for side-channel-resistant implementations of SQIsign, highlighting previously unexplored vulnerabilities in its design.",

    "abstract": "With the rise of in-vehicle and car-to-x communication systems, ensuring robust security in automotive networks is becoming increasingly vital. As the industry shifts toward Ethernet-based architectures, the IEEE 802.1AE MACsec standard is gaining prominence as a critical security solution for future in-vehicle networks (IVNs). MACsec utilizes the MACsec Key Agreement Protocol (MKA), defined in the IEEE 802.1X standard, to establish secure encryption keys for data transmission. However, when applied to 10BASE-T1S Ethernet networks with multidrop topologies, MKA encounters a significant challenge known as the real-time paradox. This paradox arises from the competing demands of prioritizing key agreement messages and real-time control data, which conflict with each other. Infineon addresses this challenge with its innovative In-Line Key Agreement (IKA) protocol. By embedding key agreement information directly within a standard data frame, IKA effectively resolves the real-time paradox and enhances network performance. This paper establishes a theoretical worst-case delay bound for key agreement in multidrop 10BASE-T1S IVNs with more than two nodes, using Network Calculus techniques. The analysis compares the MKA and IKA protocols in terms of performance. For a startup scenario involving a 16-node network with a 50 bytes MPDU size, the MKA protocol exhibits a worst-case delay that is 1080% higher than that of IKA. As the MPDU size increases to 1486 bytes, this performance gap narrows significantly, reducing the delay difference to just 6.6%.",

    "abstract": "SQIsign, the only isogeny-based signature scheme submitted to NIST\u2019s additional signature standardization call, achieves the smallest public key and signature sizes among all post-quantum signature schemes. However, its existing implementation, particularly in its quaternion arithmetic operations, relies on GMP\u2019s big integer functions, which, while efficient,  are often not designed for constant-time execution.\r\nIn this work, we take a step toward side-channel-protected SQIsign by implementing constant-time techniques for SQIsign\u2019s big integer arithmetic, which forms the computational backbone of its quaternion module. For low-level fundamental functions including Euclidean division, exponentiation and the function that computes integer square root, we either extend or tailor existing solutions according to SQIsign's requirements such as handling signed integers or scaling them for integers up to $\\sim$12,000 bits. Further, we propose a novel constant-time modular reduction technique designed to handle dynamically changing moduli.Our implementation is written in C without reliance on high-level libraries such as GMP and we evaluate the constant-time properties of our implementation using Timecop with Valgrind that confirm the absence of timing-dependent execution paths. We provide experimental benchmarks across various SQIsign parameter sizes to demonstrate the performance of our constant-time implementation.",

    "abstract": "Multi-signatures allow a given set of parties to cooperate in order to create a digital signature whose size is independent of the number of signers. At the same time, no other set of parties can create such a signature. While non-interactive multi-signatures are known (e.g. BLS from pairings), many popular multi-signature schemes such as MuSig2 (which are constructed from pairing-free discrete logarithm-style assumptions) require interaction. Such interactive multi-signatures have recently found practical applications e.g. in the cryptocurrency space.\r\n\r\nMotivated by classical and emerging use cases of such interactive multi-signatures, we introduce the first systematic treatment of interactive multi-signatures in the universal composability (UC) framework. Along the way, we revisit existing game-based security notions and prove that constructions secure in the game-based setting can easily be made UC secure and vice versa.\r\n    \r\nIn addition, we consider interactive multi-signatures where the signers must interact in a fixed pattern (so-called ordered multi-signatures). Here, we provide the first construction of ordered multi-signatures based on the one-more discrete logarithm assumption, whereas the only other previously known construction required pairings. Our scheme achieves a stronger notion of unforgeability, guaranteeing that the adversary cannot obtain a signature altering the relative order of honest signers. We also present the first formalization of ordered multi-signatures in the UC framework and again show that our stronger game-based definitions are equivalent to UC security.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present Functional Encryption (FE) schemes for Attribute-Weighted Sums (AWS), introduced by Abdalla, Gong and Wee (Crypto 2020) in the registration-based setting (RFE). In such a setting, users sample their own public/private key pairs $(\\mathsf{pk}_i, \\mathsf{sk}_i)$; a key curator registers user public keys along with their functions $h_i$; encryption takes as input $N$ attribute-value pairs $\\{\\vec x_\\ell, \\vec z_\\ell\\}_{\\ell\\in[N]}$ where $\\vec x_\\ell$ is public and $\\vec z_\\ell$ is private; and decryption recovers the weighted sum $\\sum_{\\ell\\in[N]}h_i(\\vec x_\\ell)^\\mathsf{T}\\vec z_\\ell$ while leaking no additional information about $\\vec z_\\ell$. Recently, Agrawal, Tomida and Yadav (Crypto 2023) studied the attribute-based case of AWS (AB-AWS) providing fine-grained access control, where the function is described by a tuple $(g_i, h_i)$, the input is extended to $(\\vec y, \\{\\vec x_\\ell, \\vec z_\\ell\\}_{\\ell \\in [N]})$ and decryption recovers the weighted sum only if $g_i(\\vec y) = 0$. Our main results are the following:\r\n\r\n- We build the first RFE for (AB-)1AWS functionality, where $N=1$, that achieves adaptive indistinguishability-based security under the (bilateral) $k$-Lin assumption in prime-order pairing groups. Prior works achieve RFE for linear and quadratic functions without access control in the standard model, or for attribute-based linear functions in the generic group model.\r\n\r\n- We develop the first RFE for AB-AWS functionality, where $N$ is unbounded, that achieves very selective simulation-based security under the bilateral $k$-Lin assumption. Here, \u201cvery selective\u201d means that the adversary declares challenge attribute values, all registered functions and corrupted users upfront. Previously, SIM-secure RFEs were only constructed for linear and quadratic functions without access control in the same security model.   \r\n\r\nWe devise a novel nested encoding mechanism that facilitates achieving attribute-based access control and unbounded inputs in the registration-based setting for AWS functionalities, proven secure in the standard model. In terms of efficiency, our constructions feature short public parameters, secret keys independent of $N$, and compact ciphertexts unaffected by the length of public inputs. Moreover, as required by RFE properties, all objective sizes and algorithm costs scale poly-logarithmically with the total number of registered users in the system.",

    "abstract": "Lightweight block ciphers such as PIPO and FLY are designed to operate efficiently and securely in constrained environments. While the differential attack on PIPO-64-128 has already been studied by the designers, no concrete differential attack had been conducted for PIPO-64-256 and FLY. Motivated by this gap, we revisit the security of PIPO against differential attacks and generalize the analysis framework to make it applicable to structurally related ciphers. Based on this generalized framework, we search for key-recovery-attack-friendly distinguishers and apply clustering techniques to enhance their effectiveness in key-recovery attacks. As a result, we improve the previously proposed differential attack on PIPO-64-128, reducing the time complexity by a factor of $2^{31.7}$. Furthermore, we propose a 13-round differential attack on PIPO-64-256, which covers two more rounds than the previous result. We also apply the same methodology to FLY and present the first differential attack on 12-round FLY, reaching one round beyond the best-known distinguisher. We believe this work improves the understanding of the structures of FLY and PIPO, and provides a basis for future research on advanced key-recovery attacks for related cipher designs.",

    "abstract": "Bitcoin is based on the Blockchain, an open ledger containing information about each transaction in the Bitcoin network. Blockchain serves many purposes, but it allows anyone to track all transactions and activities of each Bitcoin address. The privacy of the network is being threatened by some organizations that track transactions. Tracking and subsequent filtering of coins lead to the loss of exchangeability of Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nDespite Bitcoin\u2019s transparency, it is possible to increase user privacy using a variety of existing methods. One of these methods is called CoinJoin, was proposed by Bitcoin developer Greg Maxwell in 2013. This technology involves combining several users transactions to create a single transaction with multiple inputs and outputs, which makes transaction analysis more complicated.\r\n\r\nThis work describes the KeyJoin, a privacy-focused CoinJoin protocol based on the keyed-verification anonymous credentials (KVAC).",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a side-channel attack targeting the LESS and CROSS post-quantum digital signature schemes, resulting in full key recovery for both. These schemes have advanced to the second round of NIST\u2019s call for additional signatures. By leveraging correlation power analysis and horizontal attacks, we are able to recover the secret key by observing the power consumption during the multiplication of an ephemeral secret vector with a public matrix. The attack path is enabled by the presence of a direct link between the secret key elements and the ephemeral secret, given correct responses. This attack targets version 1.2 of both schemes. In both settings we can recover the secret key in a single trace for the NIST\u2019s security level I parameter set.  Additionally, we propose improvements to the existing horizontal attack on CROSS, reducing the required rounds that need to be observed by an order of magnitude for the same parameter sets.",

    "abstract": "Multi-signatures over pairing-free cyclic groups have seen significant advancements in recent years, including achieving two-round protocols and supporting key aggregation.\r\nKey aggregation enables the combination of multiple public keys into a single succinct aggregate key for verification and has essentially evolved from an optional feature to a requirement.\r\n\r\nTo enhance the concrete security of two-round schemes, Pan and Wagner (Eurocrypt 2023, 2024) introduced the first tightly secure constructions in this setting.\r\nHowever, their schemes do not support key aggregation, and their approach inherently precludes a single short aggregate public key.\r\nThis leaves the open problem of achieving tight security and key aggregation simultaneously.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we solve this open problem by presenting the first tightly secure two-round multi-signature scheme in pairing-free groups supporting key aggregation.\r\nAs for Pan and Wagner's schemes, our construction is based on the DDH assumption.\r\nIn contrast to theirs, it also has truly compact signatures, with signature size asymptotically independent of the number of signers.",

    "abstract": "Voter privacy and end-to-end (E2E) verifiability are critical features of electronic voting (e-voting) systems to safeguard elections. To achieve these properties commonly a perfect bulletin board (BB) is assumed that provides consistent, reliable, and tamper-proof storage and transmission of voting data. However, in practice, BBs operate in asynchronous and unreliable networks, and hence, are susceptible to vulnerabilities such as equivocation attacks and dropped votes, which can compromise both verifiability and privacy. Although prior research has weakened the perfect BB assumption, it still depends on trusting certain BB components.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we present and initiate a formal exploration of designing e-voting systems based on fully untrusted BBs. For this purpose, we leverage the notion of accountability and in particular use accountable BBs. Accountability ensures that if a security breach occurs, then cryptographic evidence can identify malicious parties. Fully untrusted BBs running in asynchronous networks bring new challenges. Among others, we identify several types of attacks that a malicious but accountable BB might be able to perform and propose a new E2E verifiability notion for this setting. Based on this notion and as a proof of concept, we construct the first e-voting system that is provably E2E verifiable and provides vote privacy  even when the underlying BB is fully malicious. This establishes an alternative to traditional e-voting architectures that rely on (threshold) trusted BB servers.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we present an improvement for QR UOV and a reparation of VOX.\r\n    Thanks to the use of the perturbation minus we are able to fully exploit the parameters in order to reduce the public key. It also helps us to repair the scheme VOX. With QR UOV- we are able to significantly reduce the size of the public key at the cost of a small increase of the signature size. While with VOX- we can obtain a public key as short as $6KB$. VOX- also maintains a very short signature size.\r\n    We also show that the use of minus perturbation is very useful with schemes that uses the QR (Quotient ring perturbation).",

    "abstract": "In key-and-message homomorphic encryption (KMHE), the key space is a subset of the message space, allowing encryption of secret keys such that the same homomorphism can be applied to both the key and the message of a given ciphertext.\r\nKMHE with suitable security properties is the main building block for constructing rerandomizable garbling schemes (RGS, Gentry et al., CRYPTO 2010), which enable advanced cryptographic applications like multi-hop homomorphic encryption, the YOSO-like MPC protocol SCALES (Acharya et al., TCC 2022 and CRYPTO 2024), and more.\r\n\r\nThe BHHO scheme (Boneh et al., CRYPTO 2008) is currently the only known KMHE scheme suitable for constructing RGS. An encryption of a secret key consists of $\\mathcal{O}(\\lambda^{2})$ group elements, where $\\lambda$ is the security parameter, which incurs a significant bandwidth and computational overhead that makes the scheme itself, and the RGS protocols building upon it, impractical.\r\n\r\nWe present a new, more efficient KMHE scheme with linear-size ciphertexts.\r\nDespite using heavier cryptographic tools (pairings instead of plain DDH-hard groups), the concrete ciphertext size and computational costs are very significantly reduced. We are able to shrink the ciphertext by 97.83 % (from 16.68 MB to 360 kB) and reduce the estimated computations for encryption by 99.996 % (from 4 minutes to 0.01 seconds) in comparison to BHHO.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we introduce gate KMHE as a new tool to build more efficient RGS. Our RGS construction shrinks the size of a garbled gate by 98.99 % (from 133.43 MB to 1.35 MB) and decreases the estimated cost of garbling by 99.998 % (from 17 minutes to 0.02 seconds per gate) in comparison to Acharya et al. \r\n\r\nIn summary, our work shows for the first time that RGS and the SCALES protocol (and hence YOSO-like MPC) are practically feasible for simple circuits.",

    "abstract": "Noisy linear algebraic assumptions with respect to random matrices, in particular Learning with Errors ($\\mathsf{LWE}$) and Alekhnovich Learning Parity with Noise (Alekhnovich $\\mathsf{LPN}$), are among the most investigated assumptions that imply post-quantum public-key encryption (PKE). They enjoy elegant mathematical structure. Indeed,  efforts to build post-quantum PKE and advanced primitives such as homomorphic encryption and indistinguishability obfuscation have increasingly focused their attention on these two assumptions and their variants.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this increasing reliance on these two assumptions for building  post-quantum cryptography leaves us vulnerable to potential quantum (and classical) attacks on Alekhnovich $\\mathsf{LPN}$ and $\\mathsf{LWE}$. Quantum algorithms is a rapidly advancing area, and we must stay prepared for unexpected cryptanalytic breakthroughs. Just three decades ago, a short time frame in the development of our field, Shor's algorithm rendered most then-popular number theoretic and algebraic assumptions quantumly broken. Furthermore, within the last several years, we have witnessed major classical and quantum \r\nbreaks on several assumptions previously introduced for post-quantum cryptography. Therefore, we ask the following question:\r\n\r\nIn a world where both $\\mathsf{LWE}$ and Alekhnovich $\\mathsf{LPN}$ are broken, can there still exist noisy linear assumptions that remain plausibly quantum hard and imply PKE?\r\n\r\nTo answer this question positively, we introduce two natural noisy-linear algebraic assumptions that are both with respect to random matrices, exactly like $\\mathsf{LWE}$ and Alekhnovich $\\mathsf{LPN}$, but with different error distributions. Our error distribution combines aspects of both small norm and sparse error distributions. We design a PKE from these assumptions and give evidence that these assumptions are likely to still be secure even in a world where both the $\\mathsf{LWE}$ and Alekhnovich $\\mathsf{LPN}$ assumptions  are simultaneously broken. We also study basic properties of these assumptions, and show that in the parameter settings we employ to build PKE, neither of them are ``lattice'' assumptions in the sense that we don't see a way to attack them using a lattice closest vector problem solver, except via $\\mathsf{NP}$-completeness reductions.",

    "abstract": "The performance of traditional BFT protocols significantly decreases as $n$ grows ($n$ for the number of replicas), and thus, they support up to a few hundred replicas. Such scalability issues severely limit the application scenarios of BFT. Meanwhile, the committee sampling technique has the potential to scale the replica size significantly by selecting a small portion of replicas as the committee and then conveying the consensus results to the rest. \r\nHowever, this technique is rarely used in BFT, and there is still a lack of methods to scale the traditional BFT protocol being deployed to support more replicas rather than the costly re-deployment of new protocols.\r\nThis paper introduces Walnut, a secure and generic committee-sampling-based modular consensus. Specifically, we use the verifiable random function for committee election and integrate committee rotation with the consensus. This resulting construction ensures that each selected committee is of a fixed size and acknowledged by all replicas, even in a partially synchronous network. For Walnut, we provide a rigorous definition and outline the necessary properties of each module to achieve safety and liveness.  \r\nTo clarify Walnut's effectiveness, we apply this framework to HotStuff to obtain the Walnut-HS protocol, together with a proof of fit-in. We also implement Walnut-HS and compare its performance with HotStuff, using up to 100 Amazon EC2 instances in WAN. The experiments show that Walnut-HS can easily scale to 1,000 replicas with only a slight performance degradation, while HotStuff performs poorly or even breaks when $n\\!>\\!200$. Besides, Walnut-HS performs well in comparison with Hotstuff for small-scale experiments. For example, the peak throughput of Walnut-HS is at most 38.6% higher than HotStuff for $n\\!=\\!100$.",

    "abstract": "Proxy re-encryption (PRE) is a powerful primitive for secure cloud storage sharing. Suppose Alice stores encrypted datasets (ciphertexts) in a cloud server (proxy). If Bob requests data sharing, Alice shares the ciphertexts by computing and sending a re-encryption key to the proxy, which will perform the re-encryption operation that generates the ciphertexts that are decryptable to Bob. Still, the proxy cannot access the plaintexts/datasets. Traditionally, the re-encryption key can convert all of Alice's ciphertexts, and the proxy should operate the re-encryption on the ciphertexts selected by the users (Alice/Bob). There is a trust issue: Alice must grant full decryption rights (losing control) to rely on proxy-enforced access policies (vulnerable to collusion). Existing PRE schemes fail to reconcile fine-grained control with collusion resistance. If Alice uses different keys to encrypt each dataset, the re-encryption complexity is linear to the number of requested datasets. We propose full-authority data sharing, a novel paradigm combining ciphertext-dependent PRE (cdPRE) and dynamic key generation (dKG). Unlike traditional PRE, cdPRE binds re-encryption keys to specific ciphertexts, ensuring collusion resistance (i.e., proxy + Bob cannot access unauthorised data). dKG dynamically connects keys via key derivation functions; for example, the chain system reduces per-dataset delegation cost to $O(1)$ for sequential release in publication/subscription systems (vs. $O(k)$ in trivial solutions, where $k$ is the number of datasets). We instantiate this paradigm with Kyber (NIST-PQC standardised) and AES, prove its security, and experimentally verify the high efficiency of the scheme.",

    "abstract": "We present an algorithm for the CSIDH protocol that is fully deterministic and strictly constant time. It does not require dummy operations and can be implemented without conditional branches. Our proof-of-concept C implementation shows that a key exchange can be performed in a constant (i.e. fixed) number of finite field operations, independent of the secret keys. The algorithm relies on a technique reminiscent of the standard Montgomery ladder, and applies to the computation of isogenies that divide an endomorphism of smooth degree represented by its kernel. We describe our method in the general context of class group actions on oriented elliptic curves, giving rise to a large family of non-interactive key exchanges different from CSIDH.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we characterize graphs of  \\emph{(graph-labeling) incremental proofs of sequential work} (iPoSW). First, we define \\emph{incremental} graphs and prove they are necessary for iPoSWs. Relying on space pebbling complexity of incremental graphs, we show that the depth-robust graphs underling the PoSW of Mahmoody et al.\\ are not incremental, and hence, their PoSW cannot be transformed into an iPoSW. \r\n\r\nSecond, and  toward a generic iPoSW construction, we define graphs whose structure is compatible with the incremental sampling technique (D\u00f6ttling et al.). These are \\emph{dynamic} graphs.  We observe that the graphs underlying all PoSWs, standalone or incremental, are dynamic. We then generalize current iPoSW schemes  by giving a generic construction that transforms any PoSW whose underlying graph is incremental and dynamic into an iPoSW.  As a corollary,  we get a new iPoSW based on the modified Cohen-Pietrzak graph (Abusalah et al.). When used in constructing blockchain light-client bootstrapping protocols (Abusalah et al.) such an iPoSW, results in the most efficient bootstrappers/provers, in terms of both proof size and space complexity.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, we show that previous iPoSW definitions allow for trivial solutions. To overcome this, we provide a refined definition that captures the essence of iPoSWs and is satisfied by all known iPoSW constructions.",

    "abstract": "TRaccoon is an efficient 3-round lattice-based T-out-of-N threshold signature, recently introduced by del Pino et al. (Eurocrypt 2024). While the design resembles the classical threshold Schnorr signature, Sparkle (Crites et al., Crypto 2023), one shortfall is that it has no means to identify malicious behavior, a property highly desired in practice. This is because to resist lattice-specific attacks, TRaccoon relies on a technique called masking, informally blinding each partial signature with a one-time additive mask. del Pino et al. left it as an open problem to add a mechanism to identify malicious behaviors to TRaccoon.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose TRaccoon-IA, a TRaccoon with an efficient identifiable abort protocol, allowing to identify malicious signers when the signing protocol fails. The identifiable abort protocol is a simple add-on to TRaccoon, keeping the original design intact, and comes with an added communication cost of 60 + 6.4 |T| KB only when signing fails. Along the way, we provide the first formal security analysis of a variant of LaBRADOR (Beullens et al., Crypto 2023) with zero-knowledge, encountering several hurdles when formalizing it in detail. Moreover, we give a new game-based definition for interactive identifiable abort protocols, extending the popular game-based definition used to prove unforgeability of recent threshold signatures.",

    "abstract": "Secret sharing is a cornerstone of modern cryptography, underpinning the secure distribution and reconstruction of secrets among authorized participants. In these schemes, succinctness\u2014measured by the size of the distributed shares\u2014has long been an area of both great theoretical and practical interest, with large gaps between constructions and best known lower bounds. In this paper, we present a novel computational secret sharing scheme for monotone Boolean circuits that achieves substantially shorter share sizes than previously known constructions in the standard model. Our scheme attains a public share size of $n + \\mathsf{poly}(\\lambda, \\log |C|)$ and a user share size of $\\lambda$, where n denotes the number of users, $C$ is the monotone circuit and $\\lambda$ is the security parameter, thus effectively eliminating the dependence on the circuit size. This marks a significant improvement over earlier approaches, which exhibited share sizes that grew with the number of gates in the circuit. Our construction makes use of indistinguishability obfuscation and injective one-way functions.",

    "abstract": "Local differential privacy (LDP) enables individuals to report sensitive data while preserving privacy. Unfortunately, LDP mechanisms are vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where adversaries controlling a fraction of the reporting users can significantly distort the aggregate output--much more so than in a non-private solution where the inputs are reported directly. In this paper, we present two novel solutions that prevent poisoning attacks under LDP while preserving its privacy guarantees.  \r\nOur first solution, $\\textit{V}\\epsilon\\textit{rity-}{\\textit{Auth}}$, addresses scenarios where the users report inputs with a ground truth available to a third party. The second solution, $\\textit{V}\\epsilon\\textit{rity}$, tackles the more challenging case in which the users locally generate their input and there is no ground truth which can be used to bootstrap verifiable randomness generation.",

    "abstract": "The study by Gohr et.al at  CRYPTO 2019 and sunsequent related works have shown that neural networks can uncover previously unused features, offering novel insights into cryptanalysis. Motivated by these findings, we employ neural networks to learn features specifically related to integral properties and integrate the corresponding insights into optimized search frameworks. These findings validate the framework of using neural networks for feature exploration, providing researchers with novel insights that advance established cryptanalysis methods.\r\n\r\nNeural networks have inspired the development of more precise integral search models. By comparing the integral distinguishers obtained via neural networks with those identified by classical methods, we observe that existing automated search models often fail to find optimal distinguishers. To address this issue, we develop a meet-in-the-middle search framework that balances model accuracy and computational efficiency. As a result, we reduce the number of active plaintext bits required for an 11-round integral distinguisher on SKINNY-64-64, and further identify a 12-round key-dependent integral distinguisher\u2014achieving one additional round over the previous best-known result.\r\n\r\nThe integral distinguishers discovered by neural networks enable key-recovery attacks on more rounds. We identify a 7-round key-independent integral distinguisher from neural networks with even only one active plaintext cell, which is based on linear combinations of bits. This distinguisher enables a 15-round key-recovery attack on SKINNY-n-n through a strategy with 3 rounds of forward decryption and 5 rounds of backward encryption, improving upon the previous record by one round. The same distinguisher also enhances attacks on SKINNY-n-2n and SKINNY-n-3n. Additionally, we discover an 8-round key-dependent integral distinguisher using neural network that further reduces the time complexity of key-recovery attacks against SKINNY.",

    "abstract": "The Signal Protocol, underpinning secure messaging for billions, faces the challenge of migrating to a post-quantum world while preserving critical properties like asynchrony and deniability. While Signal\u2019s PQXDH key exchange protocol addresses post-quantum confidentiality, full migration of the X3DH protocol remains elusive. Relying on a split KEM (K-Waay, USENIX \u201924) offers a promising migration path, but it has so far suffered from size limitations compared to concurrent works leveraging\r\nring signatures. \r\n\r\nThis work introduces Sparrow-KEM and Sym-Sparrow-KEM, novel asymmetric and symmetric split KEMs respectively, i.e. for which keys can be used interchangeably for sending and receiving, or only in one direction. They are designed to optimize the K-Waay protocol for size efficiency. Leveraging the MLWE assumption, these constructions reduce by a factor 5.1\u00d7 the communication of prior post-quantum X3DH based on split KEMs, plus provides a 40\u00d7 speedup. Additionally, Sym-Sparrow-KEM is the first symmetric split-KEM to offer deniability, IND-1KCA, and IND-1BatchCCA security, capturing implicit authentication properties. We provide formal security proofs for both schemes, including deniability. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of a compact and deniable post-quantum X3DH protocol based on split KEMs.",

    "abstract": "Localized side-channel analysis makes it possible to evaluate only the relevant chip area by measuring near-field electromagnetic (EM) emanations. Compared to global power measurements, this can lead to more powerful attacks as the signal-to-noise ratio is higher and irrelevant circuit components are not included in the recorded measurements. Especially for profiled attacks and their reproduction, the probe position in a localized scenario is of utmost importance. Ideally a probe should be placed identically during the profiling and attack phases, as small variations can have a large impact on the success of the attack. In this work we present our methodology \u2013 ProbeNav \u2013 to accurately reposition an EM probe which is optimized for localized measurements, i.e., near-field measurements. We evaluate cross-correlation, Oriented Fast and rotated Brief (ORB) and particle filters to re-calibrate the coordinate system of our setup. As a result, our methodologies show that precise positioning on a STM32F303 microcontroller is possible for a profiled attack scenario with different EM probes. Furthermore, by requiring only a single trace per position, profiling is 3 times and repositioning 28 faster in terms of number of collected traces compared to the state of the art.",

    "abstract": "We introduce posterior security of digital signatures, the additional security features after the original signature is generated. It is motivated by the scenario that some people store their secret keys in secure hardware and can only obtain a standard signature through a standardized interface. In this paper, we consider two different posterior security features: anonymity and message hiding.\r\n\r\nWe first introduce incognito signature, a new mechanism to anonymize a standard signature. Different from other ring or group signatures, the signer generates a standard (non-anonymous) signature first. The signature is then anonymized by a converter before sending to the verifier, by hiding the signer public key with a set of decoy public keys. We then introduce concealed signature which hides the message in a commitment. The standard signature is converted such that it can be verified with the commitment. The models of  posterior anonymity and  posterior message hiding capture the separation of the signer and the converter. Anonymity or message hiding is provided by the converter after the creation of a standard signature by the signer.\r\n\r\nWe give generic constructions of incognito signature and concealed signature. It can be applied to standard signatures like Schnorr. It gives the first practical anonymized ECDSA signature, and the signature size is logarithmic to the number of decoy public keys $n$. The existing ring signature scheme with ECDSA keys is at least 152 times longer than our scheme for $n \\le 4096$.\r\n\r\nThe incognito signature and concealed signature can be composed to provide posterior anonymity and message hiding. It is useful in applications like two-tier central bank digital currency, where users want to hide their addresses (public keys) and transaction amounts (messages) when the payment is settled in the interbank layer.",

    "abstract": "Side-channel analysis remains a critical threat to public-key cryptographic implementations. Simple Power Analysis (SPA) techniques can extract secret keys from a single power trace, often using clustering-based classification methods. However, traces captured in real-world environments often suffer from misalignment and variable trace lengths due to unstable clocks and random delays. As a result, clustering methods are required to use alignment methods that may alter the original information of the traces. To address this problem, this work proposes Dynamic Time Classification (DTC) as an alternative approach to classify cryptographic operations in SPA based on Dynamic Time Warping. Unlike clustering methods, DTC inherently compares power traces without requiring fixed-length segments, which greatly improved the adaptability to unequal traces and thus allows us to classify different operations relatively stably. Experimental results on public-key cryptographic algorithms and post-quantum algorithm implementations show that DTC are no less accurate than clustering methods and are more robust to timing variations. This work also systematically divides the features of different operations and explores the effects of different SPA methods on different types of feature. This work also conducts experiments with and without random delays for different categories, compares the experimental accuracy of different alignment methods, and discusses the feasibility of DTW as a preprocessing method.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by applications to efficient secure computation, we consider the following problem of encrypted matrix\u2013vector product (EMVP).  Let $\\mathbb F$ be a finite field.  In an offline phase, a client uploads an encryption of a matrix $M \\in \\mathbb F^{m\\times \\ell}$ to a server, keeping only a short secret key.  The server stores the encrypted matrix \\(\\hat{M}\\).\r\n\r\nIn the online phase, the client may repeatedly send encryptions \\(\\hat{ q}_i\\) of query vectors \\(q_i \\in \\mathbb F^\\ell\\),  which enables the client and the server to locally compute compact shares of the matrix\u2013vector product \\(Mq_i\\).  The server learns nothing about \\(M\\) or \\(q_i\\).  \r\nThe shared output can either be revealed to the client or processed by another protocol.\r\n\r\nWe present efficient EMVP protocols based on variants of the learning parity with noise (LPN) assumption and the related learning subspace with noise (LSN) assumption.\r\n\r\nOur EMVP protocols are field-agnostic in the sense that the parties only perform arithmetic operations over \\(\\mathbb F\\), and are close to optimal with respect to both communication and computation.  In fact, for sufficiently large \\(\\ell\\) (typically a few hundreds), the online computation and communication costs of our LSN-based EMVP can be \\emph{less than twice} the costs of computing \\(Mq_i\\) in the clear.\r\n\r\nCombined with suitable secure post-processing protocols on the secret-shared output, our EMVP protocols are useful for a variety of secure computation tasks, including encrypted fuzzy search and secure ML.\r\n\r\nOur technical approach builds on recent techniques for private information retrieval in the secret-key setting.  The core idea is to encode the matrix \\(M\\) and the queries \\(q_i\\) using a pair of secret dual linear codes, while defeating algebraic attacks by adding noise.",

Their paper also poses an open problem on  how to formally integrate modulus switching into this framework to reduce attack costs. The main purpose of this paper is to give a solution of this open problem  by presenting an improved provable dual attack method that incorporates modulus switching and Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) techniques. First, we design a modulus switching mechanism that eliminates practical errors via the Poisson summation formula. By embedding the inherent noise from modulus switching into a rational lattice framework, our approach effectively preventing the risk of attack failure caused by the merging of such errors with LWE noise. Theoretical guarantees (Theorems 4 and 5) rigorously quantify the parameter ranges for successful attacks. Second, we introduce a CRT-based secret recovery method that aggregates partial secrets from independent sub-attacks. By leveraging the Chinese Remainder Theorem to reconstruct full secrets from congruence relations, our method adapts to arbitrary secret distributions.  Furthermore, by using a tighter variant of Banaszczyk's measure inequality,  we obtain a precise parameter range for the dual attack's efficacy through rigorous mathematical proof, and achieve the same complementary gap  with the contradictory regime (proposed by Ducas et al.) as in Pouly et al.'s work.   Experiments show 15-29 bit superior performance in attack estimation compared to the original framework.",

    "abstract": "Anonymous communication is one of the fundamental tools to achieve privacy for communication over the internet. Almost all existing design strategies (e.g., onion routing/Tor, mixnets) for anonymous communication rely on the existence of some honest server/router in the network infrastructure to provide anonymity. A recent seminal work by Shi and Wu (Eurocrypt 2021) proposes the first cryptographic design for a non-interactive anonymous router (NIAR) that can use a single untrusted server or router to permute a set of messages without revealing the permutation to the untrusted router. This work is a really important step towards showing the possibility of designing such protocol from standard cryptographic assumptions. However, their construction is only of theoretical nature and still leaves many open questions towards realizing such systems in practice:  (1) the cryptographic building blocks (multi-client functional encryption, correlated pseudorandom function) used in their design are really difficult to implement in practice. (2) Their setup phase takes the permutation as an input to generate the encryption/decryption keys; which means that the messages from the same sender in different rounds will be at the same position in the output vector, unless the setup phase is run before every round with a new permutation. (3) It is not known how to realize such a setup procedure, that initializes a random permutation obliviously, without any trusted entities in the system.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose the first (somewhat) practical design, which we call sPAR, that solves the above problems using homomorphic encryption techniques. Our design also relies on a one-time setup phase, however the setup phase does not take any specific permutation as input. Instead, our design generates a fresh permutation for every round based on the random values locally generated by the clients. Already existing practical instantiations of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes make our design implementable and deployable in practice. Our design presents a new direction for designing anonymous communication systems. Unlike some existing systems like Tor, sPAR does not scale to millions of users, however, we demonstrate with a proof-of-concept implementation that sPAR could easily support around hundred users with a few seconds of latency for each message.",

    "abstract": "Mix networks (mixnets) safeguard client anonymity by forwarding traffic through multiple intermediary nodes (mixnodes), which reorder and delay messages to obscure communication patterns against a global passive adversary capable of monitoring all network transmissions.\r\n The anonymity provided by mixnets is usually assessed with a discrete-event simulator, gauging a target message's indistinguishability among output messages. While useful for comparative analysis, this approach only approximates the mixnet's anonymity potential. Hence, this paper sheds light on the necessity of considering the client (originator of messages) itself to gauge anonymity accurately. We further provide an algorithm (simulator) to simulate client anonymity for Loopix mixnets. We conduct experiments to optimize general Loopix mixnet parameters, considering both message and client anonymity. Our findings indicate that message anonymity often provides an upper bound and can yield misleading results for mixnet optimization, underscoring the importance of client anonymity. Additionally, we explore scenarios where client anonymity is significantly compromised due to an insufficient number of clients. To address these cases, we propose a multimixing strategy that enhances client anonymity by effectively merging varied traffic types with different mixing characteristics.",

    "abstract": "The security of block ciphers such as AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 relies on the assumption that their ciphertext outputs are computationally indistinguishable from random permutations. While distinguishers have been proposed for reduced-round variants or under non-standard models such as known-key or chosen-key settings, no effective distinguisher has been demonstrated for the full-round AES ciphers in the standard secret-key model.\r\n\r\nThis work introduces FESLA (Feature Enhanced Statistical Learning Attack), a hybrid statistical learning framework that integrates outputs from a suite of classical statistical tests with machine learning and deep learning classifiers to construct ciphertext-only distinguishers for AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256. In contrast to existing approaches based on handcrafted or bitwise features, FESLA aggregates intermediate statistical metrics as features, enabling the capture of persistent structural biases in ciphertext distributions.\r\n\r\nExperimental evaluation across multiple datasets demonstrates consistent 100% classification accuracy using Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Logistic Regression, and Na\u00efve Bayes classifiers. Generalization and robustness are confirmed through k-fold cross-validation, including on previously unseen ciphertext samples.\r\n\r\nThese results establish the first ciphertext-only distinguishers for full-round AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 under the secret-key model, and underscore the potential of machine learning\u2013augmented cryptanalysis based on principled statistical feature engineering.",

    "abstract": "Cryptographic implementations are vulnerable to active physical attacks where adversaries inject faults to extract sensitive information. Existing fault models, such as the threshold and random fault models, assume limitations on the amount or probability of injecting faults. Such models, however, insufficiently address the case of practical fault injection methods capable of faulting a large proportion of the wires in a circuit with high probability. Prior works have shown that this insufficiency can lead to concrete key recovery attacks against implementations proven secure in these models. We address this blind spot by introducing the uniform random fault model, which relaxes assumptions on the amount/probability of faults and instead assumes a uniform probabilistic faulting of all wires in a circuit or region. We then show that security in this new model can be reduced to security in the random fault model by inserting canaries in the circuit to ensure secret-independent fault detection. We prove that combining canaries with a more classical fault countermeasure such as redundancy can lead to exponential fault security in the uniform random fault model at a polynomial cost in circuit size in the security parameter. Finally, we discuss the interactions between our work and the practical engineering challenges of fault security, shedding light on how the combination of state-of-the-art countermeasures may protect against injections of many high probability faults, while opening a path to methodologies that formally analyze the guarantees provided by such countermeasures.",

    "abstract": "Implementations of modern FHE schemes are available in various highly-optimized libraries. Many of these libraries are designed to allow developers who may not have deep expertise in FHE to build fast and secure privacy-preserving applications. To support such users, the API of these libraries often hides the internals of the schemes in question from the user. However, this design choice makes it hard for users of these libraries to modify existing schemes, or implement new ones; work that is often valuable when conducting research on FHE schemes.\r\nWe present our new Rust library Fheanor, which aims to facilitate such research on FHE schemes. The core target user is an FHE researcher, rather than an application developer. Most importantly, the design of Fheanor is very modular, and mirrors the mathematical structure of the available FHE schemes. By exposing the mathematical structure, but still hiding implementation details, it is easy to modify or extend the functionality of FHE schemes implemented in the library and still preserve high performance. Indeed, Fheanor demonstrates performance that is close to that of HElib or SEAL, with the potential for optimizations in the future.\r\nFheanor implements several features that have not, or have only rarely, been implemented in previous libraries. These include non-power-of-two cyclotomic rings, single-RNS based ring arithmetic, the CLPX/GBFV scheme, and bootstrapping for BFV and BGV. \r\nIn addition, this paper presents new theoretical contributions that are also implemented in Fheanor. The first is an extension of optimal digit extraction circuits, used in BFV/BGV bootstrapping, to the case 2^23. The second is a more efficient algorithm for computing the trace in the non-power-of-two cyclotomic setting.",

    "abstract": "Scalable data availability (DA) is essential for high-throughput, decentralized blockchains, enabling lightweight nodes to verify block availability without incurring the prohibitive costs of full data replication. \r\nReed-Solomon (RS) code commitment schemes underpin modern DA protocols by ensuring that dispersed data fragments can be verified as part of a valid codeword, even in the presence of malicious block producers. \r\nHowever, state-of-the-art schemes such as FRIDA (Crypto'24), while computationally efficient, incur substantial per-node communication overhead at the scale of thousands of network nodes, often 5.7$\\times$ the size of the actual data fragment.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we introduce CONDA, a new interleaved RS code commitment scheme that significantly reduces the communication overhead while retaining FRIDA's prover efficiency. \r\nAt its core is a novel evaluation consolidation technique for polynomial commitment scheme (PCS) that reduces the problem of proving $n$ evaluations at fixed points (one per verifier) to a single evaluation at a random point, using logarithmic communication.\r\nThis technique is lightweight, hash-based, and compatible with any multilinear PCS.\r\n\r\nTo further optimize for DA applications, we introduce LightLigero, a new multilinear PCS that improves upon DeepFold (Sec'25) with $O(\\log n)$ reduction in proof size and only $30\\%$ slowdown in prover time.\r\nCombining CONDA and LightLigero yields an efficient DA scheme for thousands of nodes. \r\n\r\nOur implementation demonstrates a 4$\\times$ reduction in communication cost compared to FRIDA, while incurring only a 25\\% increase in prover time. \r\nIt also achieves near-best prover time and near-best communication cost simultaneously among all code commitment schemes.\r\nCONDA also offers at least $3\\times$ smaller proofs and $4\\times$ faster provers than state-of-the-art verifiable secret sharing constructions such as ZXH+22 (Sec'22) and PolyFRIM (Sec'24).",

    "abstract": "Homomorphic encryption provides many opportunities for privacy-aware processing, including with methods related to machine learning. Many of our existing cryptographic methods have been shown in the past to be susceptible to side channel attacks. With these, the implementation of the cryptographic methods can reveal information about the private keys used, the result, or even the original plaintext. An example of this includes the processing of the RSA exponent using the Montgomery method, and where 0's and 1's differ in their processing time for modular exponentiation. With FHE, we typically use lattice methods, and which can have particular problems in their implementation in relation to side channel leakage. This paper aims to outline a range of weaknesses within FHE implementations as related to side channel analysis. It outlines a categorization for side-channel analysis, some case studies, and mitigation strategies.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a unified approach to quantum cryptanalysis that reduces all \\emph{standard abelian hidden subgroup problems} (SAHSPs), including integer factorization, discrete logarithm in finite fields (DLP), and discrete logarithm on elliptic curves, to a single core problem: the \\emph{elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem} (ECDLP). \r\nThis reduction forms the foundation of a framework for quantum cryptanalysis based on ECDLP. At the core of this framework is a \\emph{semi-agnostic quantum algorithm} for solving ECDLP, which requires only partial knowledge of the problem's group structure. By operating on singular curves, we can translate problems such as integer factorization and finite field DLP into the ECDLP.\r\nLeveraging the semi-agnostic algorithm for ECDLP, we propose a \\emph{universal, reconfigurable quantum circuit} design that can solve any SAHSP instance by executing the ECDLP solver with appropriate curve and field parameters, without requiring problem-specific customization.\r\nWe prove that solving ECDLP in this model is sufficient to solve all instances of SAHSPs, establishing ECDLP as a \\emph{complete problem} for this class. \r\nThese results unify the structure of Shor's algorithm across all SAHSPs, eliminating the need for custom quantum circuits for each problem. This demonstrates the practical feasibility of universal quantum cryptanalysis and underscores the urgency of transitioning to cryptographic systems that remain secure against quantum-capable adversaries.",

    "abstract": "Proximity testing for linear codes is a fundamental problem in coding theory with critical applications in cryptographic protocols, blockchain, and distributed storage systems. This work addresses the proximity gaps for linear codes, a crucial aspect for efficiently verifying whether a batch of codewords is close to a given code. We present a general framework for deriving proximity gaps from the list-decodability properties of the underlying linear code.\r\n\r\nOur main result shows that if a code $C\\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_q^n$ is $(p,L)$-list-decodable, then the probability that a random combination of a batch of $t$ codewords containing a $\\delta$-far codeword (for $\\delta\\le 1-\\sqrt{1-p+\\varepsilon}$) remains $\\delta$-far from $C$ is bounded by $O(\\frac{tL^2pn}{q}+\\frac{t}{\\varepsilon q})$. This result also establishes a form of (mutual) correlated agreement for linear codes, which can be used to strengthen soundness analyses in protocols that rely on proximity testing, thereby reducing query complexity and enabling practical instantiations over smaller finite fields.\r\nIn particular, we apply our main result to randomly punctured Reed\u2013Solomon codes and folded Reed\u2013Solomon codes\u2014both of which are known to achieve list-decodability up to capacity\u2014and derive linear proximity gaps for these families under the Johnson bound.",

    "abstract": "Threshold signatures improve upon digital signatures by splitting the trust and robustness among multiple parties. In a (T, N) threshold signature any set of T parties can produce a signature but no set of less than T users can do so. Many such constructions are now available in the pre-quantum setting but post-quantum threshold schemes are still running heavy, with the state-of-the-art boasting signature sizes that are still an order of magnitude larger than post-quantum digital signatures.\r\n\r\nWe propose a novel very efficient threshold signature scheme, with a signature size close to that of a single Dilithium signature for any threshold T of at most 8 users. Our construction reduces to well-studied problems (MLWE and SelfTargetMSIS) and does not need any heavy machinery, essentially consisting in just T parallel executions of the Dilithium signature scheme. Though the resulting scheme is remarkably simple, many technical difficulties, such as sharing a secret in small shares, or simulating rejecting transcripts, have kept such an efficient threshold signature out of reach until now.",

    "abstract": "We initiate the study of multi-authority attribute-based functional encryption for noisy inner-product functionality, and propose two new primitives: (1) multi-authority attribute-based (noisy) inner-product functional encryption (MA-AB(N)IPFE), and (2) multi-authority attribute-based evasive inner-product functional encryption (MA-ABevIPFE). The MA-AB(N)IPFE primitive generalizes the existing multi-authority attribute-based inner-product functional encryption schemes by Agrawal et al. [AGT21], by enabling approximate inner-product computation under decentralized attribute-based control. This newly proposed notion combines the approximate function evaluation of noisy inner-product functional encryption (IPFE) with the decentralized key-distribution structure of multi-authority attribute-based encryption. To better capture noisy functionalities within a flexible security framework, we formulate the MA-ABevIPFE primitive under a generic-model view, inspired by the evasive IPFE framework by Hsieh et al. [HLL24]. It shifts the focus from pairwise ciphertext indistinguishability to a more relaxed pseudorandomness-based game.\r\n\r\n  To support the above notions, we introduce two variants of lattice-based computational assumptions: \r\n- The evasive IPFE assumption (evIPFE): it generalizes the assumption introduced in [HLL24] to the multi-authority setting and admits a reduction from the evasive LWE assumption proposed by Waters et al. [WWW22];\r\n\r\n- The indistinguishability-based evasive IPFE assumption (IND-evIPFE): it is an indistinguishability-based variant of the evasive IPFE assumption designed to capture the stronger security guarantees required by our MA-AB(N)IPFE scheme.\r\n\r\n  We present concrete lattice-based constructions for both primitives supporting subset policies, building upon the framework of [WWW22]. Our schemes are proven to be statically secure in the random oracle model under the standard LWE assumption and the newly introduced assumptions. Additionally, we demonstrate that our MA-AB(N)IPFE scheme can be transformed, via standard modulus switching, into a noiseless MA-ABIPFE scheme that supports exact inner-product functionality consistent with the MA-IPFE syntax in [AGT21,DP23]. This yields the first lattice-based construction of such a primitive. All our schemes support arbitrary polynomial-size attribute policies and are secure in the random oracle model under lattice assumptions with a sub-exponential modulus-to-noise ratio, making them practical candidates for noise-tolerant, fine-grained access control in multi-authority settings.",

They showed that $N$ can be factored when $d$ is less than a certain bound that depends on $r$ and $s$ in the situation $rs\\geq 2$, which is not extendable to $r=s=1$.

    "abstract": "We establish new lower bounds on the size of practical garbled circuits, which hold against any scheme satisfying the following simple properties:\r\n    (1) Its security is based on symmetric-key cryptography only. More formally, security holds in Minicrypt, a model in which a random oracle is the only available source of cryptography.\r\n    (2) The evaluation algorithm makes non-adaptive queries to the random oracle.\r\n    (3) The evaluation algorithm \"knows\" which of its oracle queries are made by which other input combinations.\r\nThese restrictions are reasonable for garbling single gates. In particular, unlike prior attempts at lower bounds, we make no assumptions about the internal behavior of the garbling algorithms --- i.e., how it uses random oracle outputs and wire labels to compute the garbled gate, etc.\r\n\r\nWe prove separate lower bounds depending on whether the scheme uses the free-XOR technique (Kolesnikov & Schneider, ICALP 2008). In the free-XOR case, we prove that a garbled AND-gate requires $1.5\\lambda$ bits; thus, the garbling scheme of Rosulek & Roy (Crypto 2022) is optimal. In the non-free-XOR case, we prove that a garbled AND-gate requires $2\\lambda$ bits and a garbled XOR-gate requires $\\lambda$ bits; thus, the garbling scheme of Gueron, Lindell, Nof, and Pinkas (CCS 2015) is optimal.\r\n\r\nWe prove our lower bounds using tools from information theory. A garbling scheme can be characterized as a joint distribution over various quantities: wire labels, garbled gate information, random oracle responses. We show that different properties of a garbling scheme imply certain Shannon-type information inequalities about this distribution. We then use an automated theorem prover for Shannon-type inequalities to prove that our inequalities imply lower bounds on the entropy---hence, size---of the garbled gate information.",

    "abstract": "Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based BFT consensus protocols often suffer from limited throughput and scalability due to bandwidth-intensive data replication to all participants. However, it is sufficient to replicate data to a smaller sub-committee of parties that holds an honest majority with high probability.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we introduce tribe-assisted reliable broadcast, a novel primitive that ensures reliable broadcast (RBC) properties within a smaller honest-majority sub-committee\u2014referred to as a clan\u2014drawn from the entire network, called the tribe. Leveraging this primitive, we develop two efficient DAG-based BFT consensus protocols. First, we present a single-clan protocol, in which a single clan is elected from the tribe, and data is disseminated exclusively to this designated clan using tribe-assisted RBC. We then extend this design to a multi-clan setting, where multiple clans are elected and data is distributed within each respective clan via the same mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that both protocols offer substantial improvements in throughput and latency over existing DAG-based BFT protocols, even at moderately large scales.",

    "abstract": "We examine the use of blockcipher-based key derivation beyond the birthday bound, arguing that the analysis step of PRP/PRF switching can be eliminated in many cases. To support this, we consider a modified ``ideal model'' for keying cryptographic applications in the multi-instance setting, where keys are chosen to be random \\emph{but distinct}, rather than completely independent).\r\n\r\nOur analysis shows that typical cryptographic applications remain secure in this model. One consequence is that it is typically safe to derive close to $2^n$ keys using an $n$-bit blockcipher in counter mode. In particular, considering the practice of nonce-derived keys for authenticated encryption, our results imply that modes such as XAES-256-GCM that use CMAC-based key derivation are safe to use with more than $2^{64}$ distinct nonces.",

    "abstract": "A verifiable delay function (VDF) requires a specified number of sequential steps to compute, yet the validity of its output can be verified efficiently, much faster than recomputing the function from scratch. VDFs are a versatile cryptographic tool, with many industrial applications, such as blockchain consensus protocols, lotteries and verifiable randomness. Unfortunately, without exceptions, all known practical VDF constructions are broken by quantum algorithms. In this work, we investigate the practicality of VDFs with plausible post-quantum security. We propose Papercraft, a working implementation of a VDF based entirely on lattice techniques and thus plausibly post-quantum secure. Our VDF is based on new observations on lattice-based succinct argument systems with many low-level optimisations, yielding the first lattice-based VDF that is implementable on today's hardware. As an example, our Papercraft implementation can verify a computation of almost 6 minutes in just 7 seconds. Overall, our work demonstrates that lattice-based VDFs are not just a theoretical construct, paving the way for their practical deployment.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic-committee Proactive Secret Sharing (DPSS) has gained increased attention for its ability to dynamically update shareholder committees and refresh secret shares, even under adversaries that gradually corrupt all nodes. However, existing state-of-the-art asynchronous DPSS protocols suffer from significant $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ message complexity and $\\mathcal{O}(\\lambda n^3)$ communication complexity, where $\\lambda$ denotes the security parameter and $n$ is the committee size.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, under the trusted setup assumption, we propose the first asynchronous DPSS protocol with $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ message complexity in all scenarios. Additionally, our protocol achieves $\\mathcal{O}(\\lambda n^2)$ communication complexity in the optimistic case, where all nodes are honest and the network is synchronous, and $\\mathcal{O}(\\lambda n^3)$ communication complexity in the worst case. Without a trusted setup, in the optimistic case, the message complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$, and the communication complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(\\lambda n^2 \\log n)$. In the worst case, our protocol preserves state-of-the-art message and communication complexities, i.e., $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(\\lambda n^3)$, respectively. Besides, our protocol supports batch amortization and accommodates high thresholds. For committee sizes of 4 to 400, the estimated concrete communication cost of our DPSS is 19--100x (resp., 8--14x) smaller in the optimistic case (resp., worst case) compared to the state-of-the-art. Experiments in AWS show that our DPSS achieves a latency of 1.9--8 seconds for committee sizes from 4 to 64. Single-machine benchmarks reveal a (computational) runtime reduction of up to 44%.",

    "abstract": "Homomorphic encryption is a powerful tool that enables computation on encrypted data without requiring decryption. While many Fully Homomorphic Encryption schemes, supporting arbitrary computations on encrypted data, have been developed using lattice-based and AGCD-based approaches, progress in composite groups has been limited to Partial Homomorphic Encryption schemes, which only support either addition or multiplication. This paper introduces the first $\\ell$-leveled homomorphic encryption schemes over composite groups, based on factoring problem, that achieve both multiplicative and additive homomorphic properties. %Additionally, a modified version of Rothblum\u2019s transformation technique is developed to provide public key variants of the symmetric schemes. \r\nOur novel design eliminates the need for relinearization operation, which is common in LWE-based HE schemes, and removes the requirement for the circular security assumption. For applications where the traffic must be indistinguishable as encrypted, a scrambled scheme is designed using a labeling technique. While the initial schemes offer an expanded message space, the introduction of the double-sized Message technique enables the encryption of messages up to twice the size without increasing the ciphertext size. Implementation results show that our schemes significantly outperform existing solutions, particularly in multiplication operations, achieving speeds up to 1000 times faster than well-known schemes such as BFV, BGV, CKKS, and TFHE.",

    "abstract": "Phase-locked loops (PLLs) embedded within field-program-mable gate arrays (FPGAs) or system-on-chip FPGAs (SoCs) present a promising methodology for the generation of random numbers. Their widespread integration across these platforms, combined with their isolated operational characteristics and robust entropy generation, as substantiated by prior research, positions PLL-based true random number generators (PLL-TRNGs) as highly effective solutions for this purpose. The present study focuses on the implementation of PLL-TRNGs utilizing the ZC702 Rev1.1 Evaluation Board, which incorporates the Zynq-7020 SoC from Xilinx. For experimental validation, a configuration involving three such boards is employed. The parameters governing the PLL-TRNG are optimized through a backtracking algorithm. Additionally, a novel, platform-adaptive technique is proposed to enhance the rate of random data bit generation while preserving entropy characteristics.  The system's performance is rigorously evaluated against the criteria established by the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) AIS-20/31 Tests, with a detailed account of the implementation process provided. Furthermore, the study demonstrates the minimal resource utilization of the PLL-TRNG design within a SoC, thereby underscoring its suitability for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, where logic resources are often highly constrained.",

    "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies enable transactions among mutually distrustful users, necessitating strong privacy, namely, concealing both transfer amounts and participants' identities, while maintaining practical efficiency. While UTXO-based cryptocurrencies offer mature solutions achieving strong privacy and supporting multi-receiver transfers, account-based cryptocurrencies currently lack practical solutions that simultaneously guarantee these properties.\r\n\r\nWith the aim to close this gap, we propose a generic framework for account-based cryptocurrencies that achieve strong  privacy and support multi-receiver transfers, and then give a practical instantiation called \\textit{Anonymous PGC}. Experimental results demonstrate that, for a 64-sized anonymity set and 8 receivers, Anonymous PGC outperforms Anonymous Zether (IEEE S\\&P 2021) --- which offers limited anonymity and no multi-receiver support --- \r\nachieving 2.6$\\times$ faster transaction generation, 5.1$\\times$ faster verification, \r\nand 2.1$\\times$ reduction in transaction size. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlong the way of building Anonymous PGC, we present two novel $k$-out-of-$n$ proofs. First, we generalize the Groth-Kohlweiss (GK) $1$-out-of-$n$ proof (EUROCRYPT 2015) to the $k$-out-of-$n$ case, resolving an open problem of its natural generalization. Particularly, the obtained $k$-out-of-$n$ proof lends itself to integrate with range proofs in a seamless way, yielding an efficient $k$-out-of-$n$ range proof, which demonstrates that $k$ witnesses among $n$ instances lie in specific ranges. Second, we extend the Attema-Cramer-Fehr (ACF) $k$-out-of-$n$ proof (CRYPTO 2021) to support distinct group homomorphisms, improving its expressiveness while reducing both prover and verifier complexities from quadratic to linear. We believe these two $k$-out-of-$n$ proofs are of independent interest, and will find more applications in privacy-preserving scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Private set intersection (PSI) enables a sender holding a set $Q$ and a receiver holding a set $W$ to securely compute the intersection $Q\\cap W$. Fuzzy PSI (FPSI) is a PSI variant where the receiver learns the items $q\\in Q$ for which there exists $w\\in W$ such that $\\dist(q, w) \\leq  \\delta$ with respect to some distance metric. Recently, Gao et al. (ASIACRYPT 2024) proposed the first FPSI protocols for $L_\\infty$ and $L_{p\\in[1,\\infty)}$ distance with linear complexity. They summarized their FPSI construction into two steps: fuzzy mapping and fuzzy matching. However, their realizations of the two steps heavily rely on public key operations, namely the DH-key exchange and additively homomorphic encryption, resulting in low efficiency.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose new FPSI protocols for $L_\\infty$ and $L_{p\\in[1,\\infty)}$ distances, primarily leveraging symmetric-key primitives. \r\nWe revisit the definition of fuzzy mapping and rigorously redefine it as a cryptographic scheme. We further introduce consistency for fuzzy mapping scheme, which could simplify the fuzzy matching step into plain PSI.\r\nWe then demonstrate how to execute fuzzy mapping step satisfying consistency. We also propose several new technologies to completely avoid the extensive use of computationally expensive public-key operations burden inherent in existing solutions.\r\n\r\nWe implement our FPSI protocols and compare them with the state-of-the-art FPSI protocols. Experiments show that our protocols perform better than state-of-the-art under all the parameters we tested. Specifically, our protocols achieve a $2.2-83.9 \\times $ speedup in running time and $1.5-11.5 \\times$ shrinking in communication cost, depending on set sizes, dimension and distance threshold.",

    "abstract": "We introduce PaCo, a novel and efficient bootstrapping procedure for the CKKS homomorphic encryption scheme, where PaCo stands for \u201c(Bootstrapping via) Partial CoeffToSlot\u201d. At a high level, PaCo reformulates the CKKS decryption equation in terms of blind rotations and modular additions. This reformulated decryption circuit is then evaluated homomorphically within the CKKS framework. Our approach makes use of the circle group in the complex plane to simulate modular additions via complex multiplication, and utilizes alternative polynomial ring structures to support blind rotations. These ring structures are enabled by a variant of the CoeffToSlot operation, which we call a partial CoeffToSlot. This yields a new bootstrapping approach within CKKS, achieving a computational complexity which is logarithmic in the number of complex slots. We further introduce a parallelized variant that enables bootstrapping over all CKKS slots with enhanced throughput, highlighting PaCo\u2019s suitability for practical and large-scale homomorphic applications. In addition to the bootstrapping technique itself, we develop several supporting tools \u2014 particularly in the context of bit-reversing and alternative ring structures for CKKS \u2014 which can be of independent interest to the community. Finally, a proof-of-concept implementation confirms that PaCo achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art methods for CKKS bootstrapping.",

    "abstract": "This work revisits the current Decentralized Storage Network (DSN) definition to propose a novel general construction based on a UTxO based ledger. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first adaptively secure UTxO blockchain-aided DSN. More concretely, we revisit the currently existing designs to thoroughly formalize the DSN definition and its security. Moreover we present a general construction, which a client delegates data to a DSN that keeps custody of it during a jointly agreed period. Our newly proposed approach, leveraged by the Extended UTxO (EUTxO) Model, neatly allows the storage network to offer automatic verifiability, i.e., without any interaction of the data owner, via proofs published in the blockchain.  In summary, this work presents a redesign of the DSN with the aid of a EUTxO based blockchain, by (1) putting forth a formal and rigorous description of a blockchain-aided DSN protocol, (2) offering a thorough description of a practical EUTxO based DSN, and (3) detailing a security analysis showing that our protocol is adaptively secure by providing (rational) security guarantees.",

    "abstract": "The Generalized BFV [Geelen and Vercauteren; Eurocrypt'25] is an efficient fully homomorphic encryption scheme that supports integer computations over large cyclotomic moduli. However, the only known bootstrapping approach cannot support large precision as it uses BFV linear transformation as a subroutine. In this work, we introduce a GBFV bootstrapping that relies on CKKS bootstrapping as in the BFV bootstrapping from CKKS [Kim et al.; CCS'24]. The new bootstrapping can handle arbitrary precision, notably bootstrapping the CLPX scheme [Chen et al.; CT-RSA'18] for the first time, bootstrapping up to $500,000$ bits of plaintext modulus in less than $20$ seconds. In addition, we introduce conversions between GBFV and CKKS and discuss its impact.",

    "abstract": "Hash-based signatures have been studied for decades and have recently gained renewed attention due to their post-quantum security. At the core of the most prominent hash-based signature schemes, XMSS and SPHINCS+, lies a one-time signature scheme based on hash chains due to Winternitz. In this scheme, messages are encoded into vectors of positions (i.e., vertices in a hypercube) in the hash chains, and the signature contains the respective chain elements. The encoding process is crucial for the efficiency and security of this construction. In particular, it determines a tradeoff between signature size and computational costs. Researchers have been trying to improve this size-time tradeoff curve for decades, but all improvements have been arguably marginal.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we revisit the encoding process with the goal of minimizing verification costs and signature sizes. As our first result, we present a novel lower bound for the verification cost given a fixed signature size. Our lower bound is the first to directly apply to general encodings including randomized, non-uniform, and non-injective ones.\r\n\r\nThen, we present new encodings and prove their security. Inspired by our lower bound, these encodings follow a counterintuitive approach: we map messages non-uniformly into the top layers of a much bigger hypercube than needed but the encoding itself has (hard to find) collisions. With this, we get a 20 % to 40 % improvement in the verification cost of the signature while keeping the same security level and the same size.\r\nOur constructions can be directly plugged into any signature scheme based on hash chains, which includes SPHINCS+ and XMSS.",

    "abstract": "SPEEDY is a family of ultra-low-latency block ciphers designed by Leander et al. in 2021. In 2023, Boura et al. proposed a differential attack on the full 7-round variant,  SPEEDY-7-192. However, shortly thereafter, Beyne and Neyt demonstrated that this attack was invalid, as the dominant differential characteristic it relied upon had probability zero. A similar issue affects another differential attack proposed the same year by Wang et al., which also targets SPEEDY-7-192 and suffers from the same flaw. As a result, although SPEEDY-7-192 was initially believed to be broken, it remained unbroken in practice, and the question of finding a valid attack on this cipher remained an open problem. In this work, we resolve this problem by presenting the first valid differential attack on SPEEDY-7-192. We verify the validity of our distinguisher using the quasidifferential framework. Moreover, our search for the differential distinguisher is significantly more rigorous than in the previous  works, allowing us to explore a larger portion of the search space. We also fully exploit probabilistic extensions of the distinguisher to identify optimal parameters for the key recovery step. Our attack on SPEEDY-7-192 has data and time complexities of 2^{186.36} encryption calls and a memory complexity of 2^{84} 192-bit states. In addition, we present differential attacks on 4-round SPEEDY-5-192 and 5-round SPEEDY-6-192 which currently represent the best attacks against these smaller variants.",

    "abstract": "Program obfuscation aims to hide the inner workings of a program while preserving its functionality. In the quantum setting, recent works have obtained obfuscation schemes for specialized classes of quantum circuits. For instance, Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2024) constructed a quantum state obfuscation scheme, which supports the obfuscation of quantum programs represented as quantum states for pseudo-deterministic quantum programs with classical inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we improve upon existing results by constructing the first quantum state obfuscation scheme for unitary (or approximately unitary) quantum programs supporting quantum inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model. At the core of our obfuscation scheme are two novel ingredients: a functional quantum authentication scheme that allows key holders to learn specific functions of the authenticated quantum state with simulation-based security, and a compiler that represents an arbitrary quantum circuit as a projective linear-plus-measurement quantum program described by a sequence of non-adaptive Clifford gates interleaved with adaptive and compatible measurements.",

    "abstract": "Quasi-Abelian Syndrome Decoding (QA-SD) is a recently in-\r\ntroduced generalization of Ring-LPN that uses multivariate polynomials\r\nrings. As opposed to Ring-LPN, it enables the use of small finite field such as GF(3) and GF(4). It was introduced by Bombar et al (Crypto 2023) in order to obtain pseudorandom correlation generators for Beaver triples over small fields. This theoretical work was turned into a concrete and efficient protocol called F4OLEage by Bombar et al. (Asiacrypt 2024) that allows several parties to generate Beaver triples over GF(2).\r\n\r\nWe propose efficient algorithms to solve the decoding problem underlying\r\nthe QA-SD assumption. We observe that it reduce to a sparse multivariate polynomial interpolation problem over a small finite field where the\r\nadversary only has access to random evaluation points, a blind spot in\r\nthe otherwise rich landscape of sparse multivariate interpolation. We develop new algorithms for this problem: using simple techniques we interpolate polynomials with up to two monomials. By sending the problem\r\nto the field of complex numbers and using convex optimization techniques inspired by the field of \u201ccompressed sensing\u201d, we can interpolate\r\npolynomials with more terms.\r\n\r\nThis enables us to break in practice parameters proposed by Bombar et\r\nal. at Crypto\u201923 and Asiacrypt\u201924 as well as Li et al. at Eurocrypt\u201925\r\n(IACR flagship conferences Grand Slam). In the case of the F4OLEage\r\nprotocol, our implementation recovers all the secrets in a few hours with\r\nprobability 60%. This not only invalidates the security proofs, but it\r\nyields real-life privacy attacks against multiparty protocols using the\r\nBeaver triples generated by the broken pseudorandom correlation generators.",

    "abstract": "The keyed sponge construction has benefited from various efficiency advancements over time, most notably leading to the possibility to absorb over the entire state, as in the full-state keyed sponge. However, squeezing has always remained limited to blocks smaller than the permutation size, as security is determined by the capacity c, the size of the non-squeezed state. In this work, we present Macakey, an improved version of the full-state keyed sponge that not only absorbs over the entire state but also squeezes over the entire state. The scheme combines ideas of the full-state keyed sponge with those of the summation-truncation hybrid of Gunsing and Mennink. We demonstrate that, with no sacrifice in generic security and with only using c bits of extra storage, Macakey can significantly boost performance,  particularly in scenarios requiring large amounts of output. For example, using the 320-bit Ascon permutation with a 256-bit capacity, Macakey outputs five times as many bits as the full-state keyed sponge.",

    "abstract": "In the wake of Manulis and Nguyen's Eurocrypt'24 paper, new CCA security notions, vCCA and vCCAD, and associated construction blueprints have been proposed to leverage either CPA or CPAD secure FHE beyond the CCA1 security barrier. These two notions are the strongest CCA security notions so far achievable, respectively, by correct and approximate homomorphic schemes. However, the only known construction strategies intimately require advanced SNARK machinery, undermining their practicality. In this context, this paper is an attempt to achieve these advanced CCA security notions in the restricted case of linearly homomorphic encryption, without resorting to SNARKs. To do so, we investigate the relationship between the Linear-Only Homomorphism (LOH) assumption, an assumption that has been used for more than a decade at the core of several proof-of-knowledge constructions, and these two recent security notions (vCCA and vCCAD). On the bright side, when working under the correctness assumption, we establish that the LOH property is sufficient to achieve vCCA security in both the private and public key settings. In the public key setting, we further show that a surprisingly simple and previously known Paillier-based construction also achieves this level of security, at only twice the cost of the baseline scheme. We then turn our attention to LWE-based schemes for which the Pandora box of decryption errors opens up. In the private key setting, we are able to achieve CPAD and vCCAD security but only in a fairly restrictive non-adaptive setting, in which vCCAD collapses onto a weak relaxation of CCA1. Finally, we eventually achieve adaptive vCCAD security provided that the number of ciphertexts given to the adversary is suitably restricted.  While bridging the gap towards credible practicality requires further work, this is a first step towards obtaining linear homomorphic schemes achieving these recent CCA security notions by means only of relatively lightweight machinery.",

    "abstract": "Blind signature schemes are essential for privacy-preserving applications such as electronic voting, digital currencies or anonymous credentials. In this paper, we revisit Fischlin's framework for round-optimal blind signature schemes and its recent efficient lattice-based instantiations. Our proposed framework compiles any post-quantum hash-and-sign signature scheme into a blind signature scheme. The resulting scheme ensures blindness by design and achieves one-more unforgeability, relying solely on the unforgeability of the underlying signature scheme and the random oracle model.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this we introduce the notion of commit-append-and-prove (CAP) systems, which generalizes traditional commit-and-prove system by making their commitments updatable before proving. This building block allows us to unlock the technical challenges encountered when generalizing previous variants of the Fischlin's framework to any hash-and-sign signature scheme. We provide efficient CAP system instantiations based on recent MPC-in-the-Head techniques.\r\n\r\nWe showcase our framework by constructing blind versions of UOV and Wave, thereby introducing the first practical blind signatures based on multivariate cryptography and code-based cryptography. Our blind UOV signatures range from 3.8 KB to 11 KB, significantly outperforming previous post-quantum blind signatures, such as the 22 KB lattice-based blind signatures, which were the most compact until now.",

    "abstract": "Web3 applications, such as on-chain gaming, require unbiased and publicly verifiable randomness that can be obtained quickly and cost-effectively whenever needed. Existing services, such as those based on Verifiable Random Functions (VRF), incur network delays and high fees due to their highly interactive nature. FlexiRand [CCS 2023] addressed these problems by hiding the output of the VRF and using that as a seed to derive many randomnesses locally. These randomnesses are instantly available for usage. However, these randomnesses can not be verified independently (or instantly) without disclosing the seed, leaving scope for malicious actors to cheat.\r\n    \r\n    To solve this problem, we introduce a new notion, called instantly-verifiable VRF (iVRF), which enables the generation of many randomnesses from one VRF output seed, such that each of them is verifiable independently - this enables the $first$ solution to $cost-effectively$ generate randomnesses, such that they are $instantly$ $available$ and also $independently/instantly$ $verifiable$.\r\n\r\n    To instantiate we propose a generic construction called InstaRand - it combines any (possibly distributed) VRF at the server's end with another VRF at the client's end to construct an iVRF. Our specific instantiation uses the BLS-based GLOW-DVRF [Euro S&P 2021] at the server's end and the DDH-based VRF of Goldberg et al. [RFC 2023] at the client's end. We use the universal composability framework to analyze the security. Moreover, due to its generality, InstaRand can be instantiated with any post-quantum secure VRF to yield a post-quantum secure iVRF.\r\n\r\n    Our experiments demonstrate that our instantiation of InstaRand is $highly$ $practical$. The client incurs a $one-time$ cost to generate the seed (server's VRF output) by querying the GLOW-dVRF servers once. Once the seed is set up, the client locally generates the pseudorandom value on demand in $0.18~ms$, avoiding the client-server round-trip delay. Each value can be independently verified in $0.22~ms$. This yields a $400\\times$ improvement in terms of output generation and $20\\times$ improvement in verification cost over existing solutions.",

    "abstract": "Isogeny-based cryptography is cryptographic schemes whose security is based on the hardness of a mathematical problem called the isogeny problem, and is attracting attention as one of the candidates for post-quantum cryptography. A representative isogeny-based cryptography is the signature scheme called SQIsign, which was submitted to the NIST PQC standardization competition for additional signature. SQIsign has attracted much attention because of its very short signature and key size among candidates for the NIST PQC standardization. Recently, many new signature schemes using high-dimensional isogenies have been proposed, such as: SQIsignHD, SQIsign2D-West, SQIsgn2D-East, and SQIPrime. Last year, SQIsign advanced to Round 2 of the NIST competition and was updated to version 2.0 (we call it SQIsign-v2.0), which is based on SQIsign2D-West. SQIsign-v2.0 achieves smaller signature sizes and faster verification. However, the signing costs are relatively high. In this paper, we propose a new signature scheme `SQIsign2DPush', which has a smaller signing cost than SQIsign-v2.0 while the signature size and the verification cost are almost the same.",

    "abstract": "We give new constructions of pseudorandom functions (PRFs) computable in $\\mathsf{NC}^1$ from (variants of the) Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) assumption. Prior to our work, the only $\\mathsf{NC}^1$-computable PRF from LPN-style assumptions was due to Boyle et al. (FOCS 2020) who constructed a weak PRF from a new heuristic variant of LPN called variable-density LPN. We give the following three results:\r\n    (1) A weak PRF computable in $\\mathsf{NC}^1$ from standard LPN. \r\n    (2) A (strong) encoded-input PRF (EI-PRF) computable in $\\mathsf{NC}^1$ from sparse LPN. An EI-PRF is a PRF whose input domain is restricted to an efficiently sampleable and recognizable set. The input encoding can be computed in $\\mathsf{NC}^{1+\\epsilon}$ for any constant $\\epsilon > 0$, implying a strong PRF computable in $\\mathsf{NC}^{1+\\epsilon}$.\r\n    (3) A (strong) PRF computable in $\\mathsf{NC}^1$ from a (new, heuristic) seeded LPN assumption. In our assumption, columns of the public LPN matrix are generated by an $n$-wise independent distribution. Supporting evidence for the security of the assumption is given by showing resilience to linear tests.\r\n    As a bonus, all of our PRF constructions are key-homomorphic, an algebraic property that is useful in many symmetric-cryptography applications. No previously-known LPN-based PRFs are key-homomorphic, even if we completely ignore depth-efficiency. In fact, our constructions support key homomorphism for linear functions (and not only additive), a property that no previously-known PRF satisfies, including ones from LWE.  \r\n    Additionally, all of our PRF constructions nicely fit into the substitution-permutation network (SPN) design framework used in modern block ciphers (e.g. AES). No prior PRF construction that has a reduction to a standard cryptographic assumptions (let alone LPN) has an SPN-like structure.\r\n    Technically, all of our constructions leverage a new recursive derandomization technique for LPN instances, which allows us to generate LPN error terms deterministically. This technique is inspired by a related idea from the LWE literature (Kim, EUROCRYPT 2020) for which devising an LPN analogue has been an outstanding open problem.",

    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables computations on encrypted data without requiring decryption. However, each computation increases the noise level, which can eventually cause decryption failures once a certain threshold is reached. In particular, homomorphic multiplication significantly amplifies noise in the ciphertext. In this work, we revisit Ring-learning-With-Error (RLWE) based encryption proposed by Fan et al. and present an optimized noise growth approach by swapping the sample space for secret key and error distribution. Thereafter, we revisit BFV homomorphic multiplication proposed by Kim et al. (ASIACRYPT'21) and present an optimized noise bound. Later, we empirically check the hardness of proposed scheme using lattice estimator. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed method achieves more than 128-bit security and achieves a lower noise bound than existing techniques.",

    "abstract": "Exclusive ownership (EO) security is a feature of signature schemes that prevents adversaries from \"stealing\" an honestly generated signature by finding a new public key which verifies said signature. It is one of the beyond unforgeability features (BUFF) which were declared to be desirable features by NIST. The BUFF transform allows to generically achieve exclusive ownership (and other properties) at the cost of an increased signature size. In this work, we study the EO security of (different variants of) Fiat-Shamir signatures. As our main result, we show that the commonly used variant of Fiat-Shamir signatures (where signatures consist of challenge-response tuples) with \u03bb-bit challenges, can achieve about \u03bb-bit EO security through its implicit usage of the BUFF transform\u2014this presents a significant improvement to existing results that only provide \u03bb/2-bit of EO security. This benefit of our result comes without an increase in signature size. For other variants of Fiat-Shamir signatures, we show worse bounds, which nevertheless improve upon existing results. Finally, we apply our results to several signature schemes: SQIsign and LESS (both round-2 NIST candidates); ML-DSA (NIST standard); CSI-FiSh; and Schnorr signatures. This shows that all these schemes achieve significantly better bounds regarding their EO security compared to existing results.",

    "abstract": "Non-interactive publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) schemes enable the decentralized (re-)sharing of secrets in adversarial environments, allowing anyone to verify the correctness of distributed shares. Such schemes are essential for large-scale decentralized applications, including committee-based systems that require both transparency and robustness. However, existing PVSS schemes rely on group-based cryptography, resulting them vulnerable to quantum attacks and limiting their suitability for post-quantum applications.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose the first practical, fully lattice-based, non-interactive PVSS scheme, grounded on standard lattice assumptions for post-quantum security. At the heart of our design is a generic framework that transforms vector commitments and linear encryption schemes into efficient PVSS protocols. We enhance vector commitments by incorporating functional hiding and proof of smallness, ensuring that encrypted shares are both verifiable and privacy-preserving. Our construction introduces two tailored lattice-based encryption schemes, each supporting efficient proofs of decryption correctness. This framework provides strong verifiability guarantees while maintaining low proof sizes and computational efficiency, making it suitable for systems with large numbers of participants.",

    "abstract": "We study the security of a popular paradigm for constructing SNARGs, closing a key security gap left open by prior work. The paradigm consists of two steps: first, construct a public-coin succinct interactive argument by combining a functional interactive oracle proof (FIOP) and a functional commitment scheme (FC scheme); second, apply the Fiat\u2013Shamir transformation in the random oracle model. Prior work did not consider this generalized setting nor prove the security of this second step (even in special cases).\r\n\r\nWe prove that the succinct argument obtained in the first step satisfies state-restoration security, thereby ensuring that the second step does in fact yield a succinct non-interactive argument. This is provided the FIOP satisfies state-restoration security and the FC scheme satisfies a natural state-restoration variant of function binding (a generalization of position binding for vector commitment schemes).\r\n\r\nMoreover, we prove that notable FC schemes satisfy state-restoration function binding, allowing us to establish, via our main result, the security of several SNARGs of interest (in the random oracle model). This includes a security proof of Plonk, in the ROM, based on ARSDH (a falsifiable assumption).",

    "abstract": "Side-channel analysis (SCA) has become a crucial area in ensuring the security of hardware implementations against potential vulnerabilities. With advancements in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), neural network(NN)-assisted techniques for SCA have demonstrated significant effectiveness. However, a fundamental question remains unanswered: are traces corresponding to different subkeys equally hard to attack? This paper addresses this issue by leveraging explainable AI techniques to analyze the hardness levels and, consequently, the root cause of hardness. To systematically investigate this problem, we reintroduce hardness metrics in SCA, which have been known to the ML community. Those metrics include query hardness (QH), log odds (LO), and matrix-based R\u00e9nyi entropy (MRE). The challenge in this regard is that (virtually all) hardness metrics in ML cannot be adopted as they are. This is because ML and SCA metrics have conflicting goals, namely boosting accuracy and rank. Through careful experimentation, we identify the shortcomings of QH and LO in SCA and recommend MRE as a suitable hardness metric for SCA.\r\nWe also study how hardness has been seen in SCA, where recent work has suggested the influence of class \u201clabels\u201d on the attack difficulty. Employing rigorous evaluation, our paper demonstrates that no statistically significant evidence can be found to support this claim. This leads us to the question of how much traces\u2019 time samples affect the inherent hardness in distinguishing key candidates. Our novel explainable AI (XAI) approach not only answers this, but also makes a link between hardness and rank as the common performance metric in SCA. Our findings indicate that hardness values are influenced mainly by time samples rather than specific key labels. Furthermore, we examine whether hardness captures intrinsic properties of the traces, specifically, their lack of separability in feature space due to their inherent similarities. To this end, we introduce, for the first time in the context of SCA, the use of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) as a principled metric. MMD effectively links trace hardness with attack difficulty by quantifying distributional differences induced by traces\u2019 time samples. In addition to visualization techniques showing the root cause of hardness based on MMD, we employ XAI to explain the connection between MMD and attack hardness. Our proposed methodology enhances the understanding\r\nof attack difficulty in SCA and contributes to developing more robust evaluation metrics for profiling attacks.",

    "abstract": "Deterministic signatures are often used to mitigate the risks associated with poor-quality randomness, where the randomness in the signing process is generated by a pseudorandom function that takes a message as input. However, some studies have shown that such signatures are vulnerable to fault-injection attacks. To strike a balance, recent signature schemes often adopt \"hedged\" randomness generation, where the pseudorandom function takes both a message and a nonce as input. Aranha et al. (EUROCRYPT 2020) investigated the security of hedged Fiat-Shamir signatures against 1-bit faults and demonstrated security for certain types of bit-tampering faults. Grilo et al. (ASIACRYPT 2021) extended this proof to the quantum random oracle model.  Last year, NIST standardized the lattice-based signature scheme ML-DSA, which adopts the hedged Fiat-Shamir with aborts. However, existing security proofs against bit-tampering faults do not directly apply, as Aranha et al. left this as an open problem.  To address this gap, we analyze the security of ML-DSA against multi-bit fault-injection attacks. We provide a formal proof of security for a specific class of intermediate values, showing that faults at these points cannot be exploited. Furthermore, to highlight the infeasibility of stronger fault resilience, we present key-recovery attacks that exploit signatures generated under fault injection at the other intermediate values.",

    "abstract": "A conventional Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) protocol consumes fresh random coins from the local random source. However, recent studies of bad randomness expose the vulnerability of some AKE protocols under small subgroup attacks when the random coins are manipulated or being repeated. It is important to ensure the bad randomness of one random source will not affect the security of the AKE protocol as a whole. \r\n\r\nThus, we introduce the notion of remote randomness by introducing additional ephemeral keys generated by a fresh remote random source in the AKE protocol. In this paper, we argue that because of the thrive of cloud computing, it encourages high\r\nspeed internal data transfer within server clusters or virtual machines, including entropy pool data used in our remote randomness AKE protocols. We present a remote randomness modification to the HMQV protocol to demonstrate its resilience under the manipulation of local random sources. We then provide a new security model with the consideration of remote randomness and show thatthe modified AKE protocol is secure under our new model.",

    "abstract": "Secure multiparty computation (MPC) allows data owners to train machine learning models on combined data while keeping the underlying training data private. The MPC threat model either considers an adversary who passively corrupts some parties without affecting their overall behavior, or an adversary who actively modifies the behavior of corrupt parties. It has been argued that in some settings, active security is not a major concern, partly because of the potential risk of reputation loss if a party is detected cheating.\r\n\r\nIn this work we show explicit, simple, and effective attacks that an active adversary can run on existing passively secure MPC training protocols, while keeping essentially zero risk of the attack being detected. The attacks we show can compromise both the integrity and privacy of the model, including attacks reconstructing exact training data.\r\nOur results challenge the belief that a threat model that does not include malicious behavior by the involved parties may be reasonable in the context of PPML, motivating the use of actively secure protocols for training.",

    "abstract": "Private set intersection (PSI) allows two parties to jointly compute the intersection of their private sets without revealing any additional information. Structure-aware PSI (sa-PSI), introduced by Garimella et al. (Crypto'22), is a variant where Alice's input set has a publicly known structure and Bob's input set remains unstructured, enabling new applications like fuzzy PSI. Their construction relies solely on lightweight cryptographic primitives such as symmetric-key primitives and oblivious transfer (OT) extension. Since then, there has been active research on sa-PSI based on lightweight cryptography. Notably, recent work by Garimella et al. (Crypto'24) achieves sa-PSI with both communication and computation costs only scaling with the description size of Alice's set, rather than its potentially large cardinality. However, this line of work remains largely theoretical, lacking efficient concrete implementations.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we close this gap by presenting a new framework for sa-PSI that achieves practical efficiency. We identify and eliminate a hidden multiplicative overhead proportional to the security parameter (e.g., 128) in prior symmetric-key-based sa-PSI constructions. A key building block of our new framework is a distributed Function Secret Sharing (dFSS) key generation protocol tailored to the structure of Alice's set, which may be of independent interest. To demonstrate the practicality of our framework, we extend our dFSS protocol to support incremental evaluation, introduce new techniques for spatial hashing, and develop several new optimization techniques, including reducing the exponential dependence on dimension and enabling load balancing between the two parties.\r\n\r\nWe instantiate our framework for structured sets defined by unions of $d$-dimensional $\\ell_\\infty$ balls, and implement our protocols using only lightweight symmetric-key primitives and OT extension. Our experiments show concrete performance improvements of up to $27\\times$ speedup in computation and $7.7\\times$ reduction in communication in low-dimensional, large-radius settings compared to existing public-key-based fuzzy PSI protocols by van Baarsen & Pu (Eurocrypt'24) and Gao et al. (Asiacrypt'24).",

    "abstract": "We leverage recently proposed multilinear polynomial commitment schemes, with linear time prover and constant proof size to reduce the communication complexity of the classical sum-check protocol for multivariate polynomials. Specifically, for degree $d$ multivariate polynomial in $\\mu$ variables which can be decomposed into multilinear polynomials, we exhibit a sum-check protocol with $O((\\ell +d)n)$ prover cost and $O(\\ell + d\\log \\log n)$ communication for $n=2^\\mu$. This enables us to break the $O(\\log n)$ barrier for this ubiquitous primitive used in multilinear SNARKs and implies first construction of prover efficient (with $O_\\lambda(n)$ proving cost) SNARKs using multilinear polynomials with $O(\\log \\log n)$ proof-size. Currently, lower communication is only obtained by SNARKs based on univariate polynomials which incur $O(n\\log n)$ prover complexity due to inherent polynomial multiplication. \r\nConcretely, using compressed sum-check in HyperPlonk protocol allows us to reduce the proof size from about $5.5$ KB $-$ $6$ KB to only about $1.5$ KB, making it competitive with univariate SNARKs like PLONK.",

    "abstract": "Threshold signatures, especially ECDSA, enhance key protection by addressing the single-point-of-failure issue. Threshold signing can be divided into offline and online phases, based on whether the message is required. Schemes with low-cost online phases are referred to as ``online-friendly\". Another critical aspect of threshold ECDSA for real-world applications is robustness, which guarantees the successful completion of each signing execution whenever a threshold number $t$ of semi-honest participants is met, even in the presence of misbehaving signatories.\r\n\r\nThe state-of-the-art online-friendly threshold ECDSA without robustness was developed by Doerner et al. in S\\&P'24, requiring only three rounds. Recent work by Wong et al. in NDSS'23 (WMY\\(^+\\)23) and NDSS'24 (WMC24) achieves robustness but demands additional communication rounds (7 and 4, respectively) or incurs costly operations in the online phase, such as computations over a homomorphic encryption scheme.\r\n  \r\nThis paper presents the first three-round threshold ECDSA scheme with both robustness and an online-friendly design. The online phase of our scheme relies solely on several elliptic-curve group operations, which are 2 to 3 orders of magnitude less computationally intensive than those based on linearly homomorphic encryption schemes. We implement our protocol and conduct a comprehensive comparison with WMY$^+$23 and WMC24. Benchmark results show that the online phase of our scheme is $2.5\\times$ faster than that of WMY$^+$23 and hundreds of times faster than that of WMC24. Lastly, we demonstrate that our techniques can be extended to construct an online-friendly and robust three-round threshold BBS+ scheme.",

    "abstract": "Private set intersection (PSI) is a well-researched cryptographic primitive that allows two parties to compute the intersection of their input sets without revealing any information about items outside of the intersection. Fuzzy private set intersection is a relatively new variant of PSI, where items are not matched exactly but ``fuzzily''. Most commonly, items are points $\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{w}$ in $d$-dimensional integer space $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ and a point is a fuzzy match to another if it lies within a ball of radius $\\delta$ centered at this point, with respect to some distance metric.\r\n\r\nPrevious works either only support infinity $(L_{\\infty}$) distance metric and standard PSI functionality, or support general Minkowski ($L_{\\mathsf{p}}$, $\\mathsf{p}\\in[1,\\infty]$) distance metrics and realize richer functionalities but rely on expensive homomorphic encryptions. Our work aims to bridge this gap by giving the first construction of a fuzzy PSI protocol for general Minkowski distance metrics relying on significantly cheaper operations during the online phase.\r\n\r\nOur main building block is a novel fuzzy matching protocol based on an oblivious pseudorandom function (OPRF), which can be realized very efficiently from vector oblivious linear evaluation (VOLE). Our protocol is able to preserve the asymptotic complexity as well as the simplicity of the fuzzy matching protocol from van Baarsen and Pu (Eurocrypt '24), while being much more concretely efficient. Additionally, we achieve several asymptotic improvements by representing intervals succinctly. Finally, we present the first fuzzy PSI protocol for infinity distance that places no assumptions on the sets of points, while maintaining asymptotic complexities comparable to the state-of-the-art fuzzy PSI protocol.",

    "abstract": "Schnorr and (EC)DSA signatures famously become completely insecure once a few bits of the random nonce are revealed to an attacker. In this work, we investigate whether post-quantum signature schemes allow for similar attacks. Specifically, we consider three Fiat-Shamir based signature schemes: Dilithium (lattices), LESS (codes) and CSI-FiSh (isogenies). Analogous to the attacks on Schnorr and (EC)DSA, we assume knowledge of some bits of the commitment randomness used in the underlying ID protocol. Such attacks belong to the broader class of Hidden Number Problems.\r\nIn the case of LESS, we give an efficient attack that requires knowledge of a single bit of the randomness in roughly \\(20000\\) signatures to completely recover the secret key. Our attack is based on the observation that knowledge of a single bit in the randomness is enough to distinguish secret key entries from random ones. Since for proposed parameters there are at most \\(548\\) candidates for each entry, we can enumerate all candidates and use the distinguisher to recover the secret key one entry at a time.\r\nFor Dilithium we are able to recover the whole secret key using at most 1792 signatures when either 3 or 4 least significant bits of the randomness are known (depending on the parameter set). Here the attack is based on the simple observation that knowledge of the least significant bits of the randomness immediately yields a linear relation in the secret key.\r\nFor CSI-FiSh, on the other hand, we obtain only an inefficient attack that requires exponentially many signatures. However, we prove that this attack is essentially optimal. Thus, our results show that CSI-FiSh comes equipped with an inherent leakage resilience. The argument easily extends to a wider class of signature schemes, but notably does not apply to the predecessor SeaSign.",

    "abstract": "Liskov, Rivest, and Wagner, in their seminal work, formulated tweakable blockciphers and proposed two blockcipher-based design paradigms, LRW1 and LRW2, where the basic design strategy is to xor the masked tweak to the input and output of a blockcipher. The 2-round cascaded LRW2 and 4-round cascaded LRW1 have been proven to be secure up to $O(2^{3n/4})$ queries, but $n$-bit optimal security still remains elusive for these designs. In their paper, Liskov also posed an open challenge of embedding the tweak directly in the blockcipher, and to address this, Goldenberg et al. introduced the tweakable Luby-Rackoff (LR) constructions. They showed that if the internal primitives are random functions, then for tweaks with $t$ blocks, the construction needs $t + 6$ rounds to be optimally $n$-bit CPA secure and $2t + 8$ rounds to be optimally $n$-bit CCA secure, where respectively $t$ and $2t$ rounds were required to process the tweaks. Since blockciphers can be designed much more efficiently than pseudorandom functions, in many practical applications the internal primitives of LR ciphers are instantiated as blockciphers, which however would lead to a birthday-bound factor, which is not ideal for say lightweight cryptography.     \r\n\r\nThis paper addresses the following two key questions affirmatively: (1) Can Goldenberg et al.'s results be extended to LR constructions with random permutations as internal primitives without compromising the optimal $n$-bit security? (2) Can the number of rounds required for handling long tweaks be reduced? \r\n\r\nWe formally define TLR-compatible functions, for processing the tweak, which when composed with 4-rounds and 5-rounds of LR construction with random permutations as internal primitives gives us respectively $n$-bit CPA and CCA secure tweakable permutations. For the security analysis, we proved general Mirror Theory result for three permutations. We also propose instantiating TLR-compatible functions with one round LR where a permutation (resp, two AXU hash functions) is used to mask single-block tweaks (resp., variable-length tweaks), thus proposing the $n$-bit CPA (resp., CCA) secure tweakable permutation candidates, $\\mathsf{TLRP5}$ and $\\mathsf{TLRP5+}$ (resp., $\\mathsf{TLRP7}$ and $\\mathsf{TLRP7+}$), using $5$ (resp., $7$) LR rounds, which is a significant reduction from the tweak-length-dependent results of Goldenberg et al. As a corollary, we also show $n$-bit CPA (resp., CCA) security of $5$-rounds (resp. $7$-rounds) permutation-based LR construction, which is quite an improvement over the existing $2n/3$-bit security proved by Guo et al.",

    "abstract": "SPEEDY is a family of lightweight block ciphers designed by Leander et al. Several differential attacks have been reported on the SPEEDY variants. However, nearly all of these attacks are based on differential characteristics with probabilities that differ from their reported values. These discrepancies arise from incorrect calculations of the (key-averaged) probability, particularly in consecutive steps within one round without intermediate key addition. In this paper, we revisit all reported differential characteristics and accurately calculate their key-averaged probabilities using quasidifferential trails. We extend this to also estimate the fixed-key probability. Our analysis reveals several characteristics with zero or significantly altered probability, invalidating several proposed attacks. We further implement a search algorithm and find a 5.5-round differential distinguisher that can be used to mount a full-round key recovery attack with a data complexity of $2^{183}$ and a time complexity of $2^{185}$. The memory complexity varies: in the chosen-plaintext setting, it is $2^{156}$, whereas in the chosen-ciphertext setting, it is $2^{36}$.",

    "abstract": "Circuit languages like Circom and Gnark have become essential tools for programmable zero-knowledge cryptography,  allowing developers to build privacy-preserving applications. These domain-specific languages (DSLs) encode both the computation to be verified (as a witness generator) and the corresponding arithmetic circuits, from which the prover and verifier can be automatically generated.   However, for these programs to be correct, the witness generator and the arithmetic circuit need to be mutually consistent in a certain technical sense, and inconsistencies can result in security vulnerabilities. This paper formalizes the consistency requirement for circuit DSLs and proposes the first automated technique for verifying it. We evaluate the method on hundreds of real-world circuits, demonstrating its utility for both automated verification and uncovering errors that existing tools are unable to detect.",

    "abstract": "Modern SNARK constructions, almost ubiquitously, rely on a polynomial commitment scheme (PCS) --- a method by which a prover can commit to a large polynomial $P$ and later provide evaluation proofs of the form \"P(x)=y\" to the verifier. \r\n\r\nIn the context of zkVMs (i.e., proof-systems for general-purpose RAM computations), the common design is to represent the computation trace as a sequence of tables, one per CPU instruction, and commit to the these tables, or even their individual columns, as  separate polynomials. Committing separately to these polynomials has a large overhead in verification costs, especially in hash-based systems.\r\n\r\nIn this work we drastically reduce this cost via a new construction which we call the jagged PCS. This PCS enables the prover to commit to the entire computation trace as a single polynomial, but then allows for the verifier to emulate access to the individual table or column polynomials, so that the arithmetization can proceed in the usual manner. The jagged PCS may be thought of as a sparse PCS for a very particular form of sparsity - namely, a \"jagged\" matrix in which each column has a different height.\r\n\r\nOur construction of the jagged PCS is highly performant in practice. In contrast to existing sparse PCS constructions for general sparse polynomials, the jagged PCS does not require the prover to commit to any additional oracles and the prover cost is dominated by 5 finite field multiplications per element in the trace area. Furthermore, we implement the verifier as an arithmetic circuit that depends only on the total trace area - thereby significantly reducing the problem of \"combinatorial explosion\" often encountered in zkVM recursion.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we show two simple variations of a data availability scheme which enable it to act as a multilinear polynomial commitment scheme over the data in a block. The first variation enables commitments over all of the block's data with zero prover overhead: the data availability construction simply serves both purposes. The second variation allows commitments over subsets of data with nonzero but still concretely small proving costs, since most work is already done during data encoding. This works especially well for blockchains with a high degree of data parallelism, as data-parallel computation is particularly amenable to efficient GKR proofs. Since, in GKR, opening the polynomial commitment contributes significantly to prover costs, our construction enables the prover to reuse work already done by the data availability scheme, reducing\u2014or wholly removing\u2014work associated with the polynomial commitment scheme.",

    "abstract": "Rep3 denotes the implementation of semi-honest three-party computation with an honest majority in MP-SPDZ (CCS'20). It uses replicated secret sharing with one message per multiplication and party as proposed by Araki et al. (CCS'16). This approach is rivaled by Astra (CCSW'19) and Trio (PETS'25), which use function-dependent preprocessing. The latter is more involved than, e.g., Beaver triples which can be used as a commodity.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we present a full implementation of Astra and Trio in MP-SPDZ, and we evaluate the costs of the different approaches. We show the equivalence of the schemes, which implies that a protocol in any of the schemes can be translated to one in another with the same overall communication cost. We also present an improvement to two important building blocks for privacy-preserving computation, namely secure comparison and probabilistic truncation used in fixed-point arithmetic. To evaluate our implementation, we have benchmarked machine learning training and inference in all three schemes, improving on Keller and Sun (ICML'22) by over 30%. Our implementation also highlights the large storage requirements of function-dependent preprocessing as it runs the two phases separately. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation to do so.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose SQIsign2D$^2$, a novel digital signature scheme within the SQIsign2D family. Unlike other SQIsign2D variants, SQIsign2D$^2$ employs the prime $p=CD-1$ as the field characteristic, where $D=2^{e_2}$, $C=3^{e_3}$ and $C\\approx D\\approx \\sqrt{p}$. By leveraging accessible $C$-isogenies, SQIsign2D$^2$ significantly reduces the degree requirements for two-dimensional isogeny computations, thereby lowering the overall computational overhead compared to other SQIsign2D variants.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also provide a proof-of-concept implementation of SQIsign2D$^2$, and give an efficiency comparison between SQIsign2D$^2$ and other SQIsign2D variants. In particular, the experimental results demonstrate that the key generation and signing phases of SQIsign2D$^2$ are more than twice as fast as those of SQIsign2D-East at the NIST-I security level, respectively. Additionally, the verification performance in SQIsign2D$^2$ exhibits marginally improved efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Transaction details and participant identities on the blockchain are often publicly exposed. In this work, we posit that blockchain's transparency should not come at the cost of privacy. To that end, we introduce zero-knowledge authenticators (zkAt), a new cryptographic primitive for privacy-preserving authentication on public blockchains. zkAt utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to enable users to authenticate transactions, while keeping the underlying authentiction policies private. \r\n\r\nPrior solutions for such {policy-private authentication} required the use of threshold signatures, which can only hide the threshold access structure itself. In comparison, zkAt provides privacy for arbitrarily complex authentication policies, and offers a richer interface even within the threshold access structure by, for instance, allowing for the combination of signatures under distinct signature schemes.\r\n\r\nIn order to construct zkAt, we design a compiler that transforms the popular Groth16 non-interactive zero knowledge (NIZK) proof system into a NIZK with equivocable verification keys, a property that we define in this work. Then, for any zkAt constructed using proof systems with this new property, we show that all public information must be independent of the policy, thereby achieving policy-privacy.\r\n\r\nNext, we give an extension of zkAt, called zkAt+ wherein, assuming a trusted authority, policies can be updated obliviously in the sense that a third-party learns no new information when a policy is updated by the policy issuer. We also give a theoretical construction for zkAt+ using recursive NIZKs, and explore the integration of zkAt into modern blockchains. Finally, to evaluate their feasibility, we implement both our schemes for a specific threshold access structure. Our findings show that zkAt achieves comparable performance to traditional threshold signatures, while also attaining privacy for significantly more complex policies with very little overhead.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces $\\mathsf{HyperWolf}$, a Hypercube-Wise Optimized polynomial commitment scheme based on Lattices over ring Fields.\r\nThe scheme achieves succinctness with $O(\\log N)$ proof size and verifier time, along with linear prover cost. It supports both univariate and multilinear polynomials under a unified framework.\r\nInspired by the two-dimensional tensor structure employed in \\cite{golovnev2021brakedown} to achieve sublinear efficiency, we generalize the idea to a $k$-dimensional tensor (hypercube) structure and design a $k$-round recursive proof protocol, where each round performs a dimensionality reduction,  which results in an overall efficiency of $O(kN^{1/k})$. By setting $k = \\log N$, our scheme achieves near-optimal asymptotic performance.\r\n\r\n$\\mathsf{HyperWolf}$ is fully transparent and relies only on the standard lattice assumption over rings. In terms of concrete efficiency, for polynomials with $N = 2^{25}$ coefficients, our scheme yields proof sizes that are $8\\times$ smaller than the lattice-based scheme of \\cite{cini2024polynomial} (Crypto24), and over $200\\times$ smaller than $\\mathsf{SLAP}$ \\cite{albrecht2024slap} (Eurocrypt24).

    "abstract": "The ongoing search for secure post-quantum cryptographic primitives has led to the development of numerous novel digital signature schemes. In this paper we introduce $\\mathsf{SPECK}$, a new signature protocol based on the similarities between the Permuted Kernel Problem ($\\mathsf{PKP}$) and the Permutation Code Equivalence Problem ($\\mathsf{PEP}$). At its core, $\\mathsf{SPECK}$ is built on the permutation version of LESS, but introduces a key modification to the commitment step. Indeed, instead of committing to an entire permuted code, the prover commits to a random relaxed $\\mathsf{PKP}$ (that we call $\\mathsf{PECK}$, Permutation Equivalence of Codes and Kernel) instance by randomly choosing a codeword from a random permutation of the initial code. In this sense, the secret key is used as a trapdoor to solve the committed $\\mathsf{PECK}$ instance. The new approach allows for a faster verification that does not involve gaussian elimination, while maintains roughly the same signature size as LESS. We present the $\\mathsf{Speck}$ protocol in detail and provide a deep analysis of the security of the new introduced assumptions.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce SCMAC, a general framework that transforms large-memory stream ciphers into AEAD schemes. It represents an intermediate design paradigm between Encrypt-then-MAC and dedicated single-pass AEAD, partially integrating encryption and authentication mechanisms while mitigating the risk of state leakage associated with immediate absorption and squeezing. Consequently, this approach harmonizes high performance with enhanced security. Additionally, we propose LOL2.0, an enhanced version of the blockwise stream cipher design framework LOL. This new framework improves security through modifications to the FSM update and output functions, and increases flexibility in constructing LFSR components. Based on SCMAC}$ and LOL2.0, we present two AEAD ciphers, LOL2.0-Mini and LOL2.0-Double, which support both stream cipher and AEAD modes. These ciphers are tailored to Beyond 5G/6G environments, offering 256-bit key length and resistance to known cryptanalysis methods, including differential, linear, and integral attacks. They also provide 128-bit security against forgery attacks in the nonce-respecting setting. Due to their compatibility with AES-NI and SIMD instructions, LOL2.0-Mini and LOL2.0-Double achieve software performance of 90 Gbps and 144 Gbps in stream cipher mode, respectively. In AEAD mode, they perform at 59 Gbps and 110 Gbps, significantly faster than their predecessor's Encrypt-then-MAC versions.",

    "abstract": "Conventional hash functions are often inefficient in zero-knowledge proof settings, leading to design of several ZK-friendly hash functions. On the other hand, lookup arguments have recently been incorporated into zero-knowledge protocols, allowing for more efficient handling of ``ZK-unfriendly'' operations, and hence ZK-friendly hash functions based on lookup tables.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose a new ZK-friendly hash function, dubbed $\\mathsf{Polocolo}$, that employs an S-box constructed using power residues. Our approach reduces the numbers of gates required for table lookups, in particular, when combined with Plonk, allowing one to use such nonlinear layers over multiple rounds. We also propose a new MDS matrix for the linear layer of $\\mathsf{Polocolo}$. In this way, $\\mathsf{Polocolo}$ requires fewer Plonk gates compared to the state-of-the-art ZK-friendly hash functions. For example, when $t = 8$, $\\mathsf{Polocolo}$ requires $21\\%$ less Plonk gates compared to Anemoi, which is currently the most efficient ZK-friendly hash function, where $t$ denotes the size of the underlying permutation in blocks of $\\mathbb F_p$. For $t = 3$, $\\mathsf{Polocolo}$ requires $24\\%$ less Plonk gates than Reinforced Concrete, which is one of the recent lookup-based ZK-friendly hash functions.",

    "abstract": "Meme tokens represent a distinctive asset class within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, characterized by high community engagement, significant market volatility, and heightened vulnerability to market manipulation. This paper introduces an innovative approach to assessing liquidity risk in meme token markets using entity-linked address identification techniques. We propose a multi-dimensional method integrating fund flow analysis, behavioral similarity, and anomalous transaction detection to identify related addresses. We develop a comprehensive set of liquidity risk indicators tailored for meme tokens, covering token distribution, trading activity, and liquidity metrics. Empirical analysis of tokens like BabyBonk, NMT, and BonkFork validates our approach, revealing significant disparities between apparent and actual liquidity in meme token markets. The findings of this study provide significant empirical evidence for market participants and regulatory authorities, laying a theoretical foundation for building a more transparent and robust meme token ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "The search rank-2 module Lattice Isomorphism Problem (smLIP), over a cyclotomic ring of degree a power of two, can be reduced to an instance of the Lattice Isomorphism Problem (LIP) of at most half the rank if an adversary knows a nontrivial automorphism of the underlying integer lattice. Knowledge of such a nontrivial automorphism speeds up the key recovery attack on HAWK at least quadratically, which would halve the number of security bits.\r\n\r\nLuo et al. (ASIACRYPT 2024) recently found an automorphism that breaks omSVP, the initial underlying hardness assumption of HAWK. The team of HAWK amended the definition of omSVP to include this so-called symplectic automorphism in their submission to the second round of NIST's standardization of additional signatures. This work provides confidence in the soundness of this updated definition, assuming smLIP is hard, since there are plausibly no more trivial automorphisms that allow winning the omSVP game easily.\r\n\r\nAlthough this work does not affect the security of HAWK, it opens up a new attack avenue involving the automorphism group that may be theoretically interesting on its own.",

    "abstract": "Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) allows multiple parties to perform privacy-preserving computation on their secret data.  MPC protocols based on secret sharing have high throughput which makes them well-suited for batch processing, where multiple instances are evaluated in parallel. \r\nSo far, practical implementations of secret sharing-based MPC protocols mainly focus on runtime and communication efficiency, so the memory overhead of protocol implementations is often overlooked. Established techniques to reduce the memory overhead for constant-round garbled circuit protocols cannot be directly applied to secret sharing-based protocols because they would increase the round complexity. Additionally, state-of-the-art implementations of secret sharing-based MPC protocols are implemented in C/C++ and may exhibit memory unsafety and memory leaks, which could lead to undefined behavior.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present SEEC: SEEC Executes Enormous Circuits, a framework for secret sharing-based MPC \r\nwith a novel approach to address memory efficiency and safety without compromising on runtime and communication efficiency. We realize SEEC in Rust, a language known for memory-safety at close-to-native speed. To reduce the memory footprint, we develop an in-memory representation for sub-circuits. Thus, we never inline sub-circuit calls during circuit evaluation, a common issue that blows up memory usage in MPC implementations. \r\nWe compare SEEC with the state-of-the-art secret sharing-based MPC frameworks ABY (NDSS'15), MP-SPDZ (CCS'20), and MOTION (TOPS'22) w.r.t. runtime, memory, and communication efficiency. Our results show that our reliable and memory-safe implementation has competitive or even better performance.",

    "abstract": "A multi-valued broadcast protocol allows a sender $P_s$ to broadcast an $\\ell$-bit message $m$ to $n$ recipients. \r\nFor all relevant models, multi-valued broadcast protocols with asymptotically optimal communication complexity $\\mathcal{O}(\\ell n)+\\mathrm{Poly}(n)$ have been published.\r\n\r\nDespite their very low communication complexity, these protocols perform poorly in modern networks.\r\nEven if the network allows all $n$ parties to send messages at the same time, the execution time of the protocols is proportional to $\\ell n$ (instead of $\\ell$). \r\nEven if the network allows to use all bilateral channels at the same time, the execution time is still proportional to $\\ell$ (instead of $\\ell/n$).\r\n    \r\nWe ask the natural question whether multi-valued broadcast protocols exist which take time proportional to $\\ell$ if parties can simultaneously send messages, and even take time proportional to $\\ell/n$ if the bilateral channels can be used simultaneously. We provide a complete characterization of multi-valued broadcast with a two-fold answer:\r\n\r\nOn the negative side, we prove that for $t<n$, multi-valued broadcast requires time proportional to $\\ell n$, if parties can simultaneously send messages, respectively take time proportional to $\\ell$ if bilateral channels can be used simultaneously.\r\n\r\nOn the positive side, we prove that for $t < (1-\\epsilon)n$ (for any fixed $\\epsilon$), multi-valued broadcast in time proportional to $\\ell$ (when parties can send messages simultaneously), respectively proportional to $\\ell/n$ (if bilateral channels can be used simultaneously) is possible. We provide such protocols both with cryptographic security as well as with statistical security.",

This extends, for instance, the complete state of the art in integral cryptanalysis from $\\mathbf{F}_2^n$ to $\\mathbf{F}_q^n$, for all prime powers $q$. A compact representation of transition matrices, based on convex polyhedra, is introduced to ensure that the proposed methods are computationally efficient even for large $p$.\r\nAutomated tools are developed and applied to a few generic and several concrete primitives. The analysis shows that previous degree estimates for Feistel-GMiMC, HadesMiMC, AES-Prime, small-pSquare and mid-pSquare are overly optimistic. Furthermore, except for AES-Prime, these primitives do not meet their design criteria unless their number of rounds is substantially increased.",

    "abstract": "Proof systems of arbitrary computations have found many applications in recent years. However, the proving algorithm has a consequent complexity tied to the size of the computation being proved. Thus, proving large computations is quite ine\ufb03cient. One of these large computations is the scalar multiplication over an elliptic curve. In this work, we provide new techniques for reducing the time corresponding to proving a scalar multiplication, using integer lattice reduction or a (half) extended Euclidean algorithm in a ring of integers. We investigate optimizations in the case of small (complex multiplication) discriminant curves, and its generalization for multi scalar multiplications as used in signature verification. We provide an optimized Golang implementation for di\ufb00erent elliptic curves in di\ufb00erent proof systems settings. The speed-up in proving time is between 22% and 53% compared to the previous state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "Introduced by Canetti in 2001, Universal Composability (UC) is a widely adopted security model that enables the specification and proof of security for a broad range of protocols, offering strong security guarantees. \r\nAt its core lies the universal composition theorem (UC theorem), which ensures that protocols proven secure within  the framework remain secure even when deployed in real-world environments with multiple instances of them.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we present two key contributions. First, we identify several problems with the UC framework, in particular the UC Theorem. They include counterexamples, limitations that make it unusable for important classes of protocols, and weaknesses in its proof. These problems reveal flaws in nearly all the fundamental concepts of UC.\r\n\r\nSecondly, we update the main concepts of UC to address these problems. Although these revisions are nontrivial, our updated definitions are intended to stay as closely aligned with the original model as possible, while providing greater simplicity overall. To ensure the validity of these updates, we present a proof of the updated UC theorem, which is more detailed and modular than the original.",

    "abstract": "Constant-time implementations are a cornerstone of secure\r\ncryptographic systems, particularly in the context of key exchange protocols and digital signature schemes. These implementations are designed to eliminate timing side-channel vulnerabilities by ensuring that the program\u2019s execution time is independent of secret data. A fundamental building block for achieving constant-time behavior is the conditional move operation. Unlike traditional branching constructs (such as if statements), which may introduce data-dependent timing variations, conditional moves allow developers to write logic that behaves identically at the hardware level regardless of input values. As a result, they are widely used in cryptographic libraries and standards to ensure both functional correctness and resistance to timing attacks. In this work, we describe our efforts to implement elliptic curve cryptography with some immunity against certain power leakage side-channel attacks, using standard C and Rust code.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress on zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) based on vector oblivious linear evaluation (VOLE) offers a promising paradigm for scaling ZKPs over extremely large statements. In particular, VOLE-based ZK is currently the best choice in terms of end-to-end execution time. However, VOLE-based ZK incurs high communication overhead \u2014 it usually scales linearly with the circuit size.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this, existing literature considers VOLE-based ZK over structured statements. In this work, we focus on the batched disjunctive statement \u2014 $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{V}$ agree on $B$ fan-in $2$ circuits $\\mathcal{C}_1, \\ldots, \\mathcal{C}_{B}$ over a field $\\mathbb{F}$;  each circuit is of size $C$ with $n_{\\mathit{in}}$ inputs. $\\mathcal{P}$'s goal is to demonstrate the knowledge of $R$ witnesses $(\\mathit{id}_j \\in [B]$, $\\boldsymbol{w}_j \\in \\mathbb{F}^{n_{\\mathit{in}}})$ for each $j \\in [R]$ s.t. $\\forall j \\in [R], \\mathcal{C}_{\\mathit{id}_j}(\\boldsymbol{w}_j) = 0$ where neither $\\boldsymbol{w}_j$ nor $\\mathit{id}_j$ is revealed. Batched disjunctive statements are effective, e.g., in emulating the CPU execution inside ZK. Note, the na\u00efve solution results in a circuit of size $\\mathcal{O}(RBC)$.\r\n\r\nTo prove such a statement using VOLE-based ZK, the prior state-of-the-art protocol $\\mathsf{Antman}$ (Weng et al., CCS'22) incurred $\\mathcal{O}(BC + R)$ communication by additionally relying on AHE, whereas $\\mathsf{Batchman}$ (Yang et al., CCS'23) achieved $\\mathcal{O}(RC + B)$ communication using only VOLE.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we combine these two protocols non-trivially and present a novel protocol $\\mathsf{Justvengers}$ \u2014 targeting the batched disjunctive statement \u2014 that incurs only $\\mathcal{O}(R + B + C)$ communication and $\\mathcal{O}(BC + (B + C)R\\log R)$ computation for prover, using AHE and VOLE.",

    "abstract": "Logic locking is an obfuscation technique designed to protect the intellectual property of hardware designs and has attracted considerable attention for over a decade. However, most logic locking schemes have been developed heuristically, leading the field into a cat-and-mouse game between attackers and defenders. Indeed, several proposed schemes have already been broken. While recent works have introduced provably secure logic locking, they often incur impractical overhead or fail to support the ASIC design paradigm while offering strong theoretical security guarantees.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose PSYLOCKE, a provably secure and practically efficient logic locking scheme that balances formal security guarantees with implementation feasibility. We introduce a new security paradigm that formalizes logic locking under predetermined allowable leakage, such as circuit topology, and we provide refined definitions of resilience against specific attacks. Our analysis bridges general security definitions and attack resilience, quantifying how leakage impacts the success of real-world attacks. PSYLOCKE is provably secure under topology leakage and achieves significant efficiency improvement compared to existing provably secure logic locking schemes. Alongside our theoretical analysis, we demonstrate through quantitative evaluations using widely-used benchmark circuits that PSYLOCKE strikes a favorable balance between practical performance and security. Concretely, PSYLOCKE reduced the Area-Power-Delay overhead by an order of magnitude while achieving the same security level, compared to the existing provably secure logic locking scheme.",

    "abstract": "In its decisional form, the module-Lattice Isomorphism Problem (decision module-LIP) has received first attention in a paper by Ling, Liu and Mendelsohn. The authors gave a polynomial-time algorithm to distinguish spinor genera within the genus of a quadratic binary $\\mathcal{O}_F$-lattice, assuming that $\\mathcal{O}_F$ is a principal ideal domain. However, this algorithm would not impact cryptographic schemes based on decision module-LIP for lattices such as those employed in HAWK, i.e., for binary $\\mathcal{O}_K$-lattices equipped with an Hermitian form (with $K$ a cyclotomic number field). Motivated by HAWK's framework, we investigate a concept that serves as an analogue of the spinor genus for Hermitian lattices, called special genus. This notion was studied by Shimura who provided a complete set of invariants for describing special genera. Building on this result, we propose an algorithm to determine whether two Hermitian lattices belong to the same special genus. Specifically for HAWK's lattice and sibblings, our algorithm runs in classical polynomial-time.  Nevertheless we provide numerical evidence suggesting that the ability to distinguish special genera does not, in practice, constitute a significative advantage for solving decision module-LIP.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen the widespread adoption of zkSNARKs constructed over small fields, including but not limited to, the Goldilocks field, small Mersenne prime fields, and tower of binary fields. Their appeal stems primarily from their efficacy in proving computations with small bit widths, which facilitates efficient proving of general computations and offers significant advantages, notably yielding remarkably fast proving efficiency for tasks such as proof of knowledge of hash preimages. Nevertheless, employing these SNARKs to prove algebraic statements (e.g., RSA, ECDSA signature verification) presents efficiency challenges. \r\n\r\nTo address this problem, we first define a new circuit model: arithmetic circuits with additional \\textit{exponentiation gates}. These gates serve as fundamental building blocks for establishing more intricate algebraic relations. Then we present a \\textit{Hash-committed Commit-and-Prove (HCP)} framework to construct Non-interactive Zero-knowledge (NIZK) proofs for the satisfiability of these circuits. Specifically, when proving knowledge of group exponentiations in discrete logarithm hard groups and RSA groups, compared to verifying complex group exponentiations within SNARK circuits, our approach requires proving only more lightweight computations within the SNARK, such as zk-friendly hash functions (e.g., Poseidon hash function). The number of these lightweight computations depends solely on the security parameter. This differentiation leads to substantial speedups for the prover relative to direct SNARK methods, while maintaining competitive proof size and verification cost.",

    "abstract": "The Nakamoto consensus protocol underlying the Bitcoin blockchain uses proof of work as a voting mechanism. Honest miners who contribute hashing power towards securing the chain try to extend the longest chain they are aware of. Despite its simplicity, Nakamoto consensus achieves meaningful security guarantees assuming that at any point in time, a majority of the hashing power is controlled by honest parties. This also holds under ``resource variability'', i.e., if the total hashing power varies greatly over time.\r\n\r\nProofs of space (PoSpace) have been suggested as a more sustainable replacement for proofs of work. Unfortunately, no construction of a ``longest-chain'' blockchain based on PoSpace, that is secure under dynamic availability, is known. In this work, we prove that without additional assumptions no such protocol exists. We exactly quantify this impossibility result by proving a bound on the length of the fork required for double spending as a function of the adversarial capabilities. This bound holds for any chain selection rule, and we also show a chain selection rule (albeit a very strange one) that almost matches this bound.  \r\n\r\nConcretely, we consider a security game in which the honest parties at any point control $\\phi>1$ times more space than the adversary. The adversary can change the honest space by a factor $1\\pm \\varepsilon$ with every block (dynamic availability), and ``replotting'' the space (which allows answering two challenges using the same space) takes as much time as $\\rho$ blocks.\r\n\r\nWe prove that no matter what chain selection rule is used, in this game the adversary can create a fork of length $\\phi^2\\cdot \\rho / \\varepsilon$ that will be picked as the winner by the chain selection rule.\r\n\r\nWe also provide an upper bound that matches the lower bound up to a factor $\\phi$. There exists a chain selection rule (albeit a very strange one) which in the above game requires forks of length at least $\\phi\\cdot \\rho / \\varepsilon$.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur results show the necessity of additional assumptions to create a secure PoSpace based longest-chain blockchain. The Chia network in addition to PoSpace uses a verifiable delay function. \r\nOur bounds show that an additional primitive like that is necessary.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the security assumptions required to prove the adaptive security of threshold signatures. Adaptive security is a strong notion of security that allows an adversary to corrupt parties at any point during the execution of the protocol, and is of practical interest due to recent standardization efforts for threshold schemes. Towards this end, we give two different impossibility results.\r\n\r\nWe begin by formalizing the notion of a key-unique threshold signature scheme, where public keys have a unique correspondence to secret keys and there is an efficient algorithm for checking that public keys are well-formed. Key-uniqueness occurs in many threshold schemes that are compatible with standard, single-party signatures used in practice, such as BLS, ECDSA, and Schnorr signatures.\r\n\r\nOur first impossibility result demonstrates that it is impossible to prove the adaptive security of any key-unique threshold signature scheme under any non-interactive computational assumption for a broad class of reductions, in the range $\u230at/2\u230b< t_c \u2264 t$, where $n$ is the total number of parties, $t_c$ is the number of corrupted parties, and $t+ 1$ is the threshold. We begin by ruling out full adaptive security (i.e., $t_c = t$ corruptions) for key-unique threshold signatures under non-interactive computational assumptions, including, but not limited to, the discrete logarithm (DL), computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH), and q-Strong Diffie-Hellman (q-SDH) assumptions. We then generalize this impossibility result for all $t_c$ such that $\u230at/2\u230b< t_c \u2264 t$.\r\n\r\nOur second impossibility result applies specifically to key-unique threshold Schnorr signatures, currently an active area of research. We demonstrate that, even under the interactive computational assumptions One-More Discrete Logarithm (OMDL) and Algebraic OMDL (AOMDL), it is impossible to prove adaptive security for $\u230at/2\u230b< t_c \u2264 t$ in the programmable ROM with rewinding.\r\n\r\nTaken together, our results underscore the difficulty of achieving adaptive security for key-unique threshold signatures. However, we believe this work can open a new line of research, by indicating assumptions and properties to aim for when constructing adaptively secure threshold schemes.",

    "abstract": "Witness encryption allows one to encrypt a message to an $\\mathsf{NP}$ relation $\\mathcal{R}$ and a statement $x$. The corresponding decryption key is any valid $\\mathsf{NP}$ witness $w$. In a succinct witness encryption scheme, we require that the size of the ciphertext be sublinear in the size of the $\\mathsf{NP}$ relation. Currently, all realizations of succinct witness encryption for $\\mathsf{NP}$ rely on strong assumptions such as pseudorandom obfuscation, extractable witness encryption, or differing-inputs obfuscation. Notably, none of these notions are known from standard assumptions.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we consider a relaxation of succinct witness encryption for $\\mathsf{NP}$ to the setting of batch $\\mathsf{NP}$. In this setting, one encrypts to an $\\mathsf{NP}$ relation $\\mathcal{R}$ together with $K$ statements $x_1, \\ldots, x_K$. In the basic version, one can decrypt if they have a witness $w_1, \\ldots, w_K$ for all $K$ statements. The succinctness requirement is that the size of the ciphertext should be sublinear in the number of instances $K$, but is allowed to grow with the size of the $\\mathsf{NP}$ relation (i.e., the size of a single instance). More generally, we can also impose a (monotone) policy $P \\colon \\{0,1\\}^K \\to \\{0,1\\}$ over the $K$ instances. In this case, decryption is possible only if there exists $w_1, \\ldots, w_K$ such that $P(\\mathcal{R}(x_1, w_1), \\ldots, \\mathcal{R}(x_K, w_K)) = 1$.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we initiate a systematic study of succinct witness encryption for batch languages. We start with two simple constructions that support CNF and DNF policies based on plain witness encryption in conjunction with a somewhere statistically sound batch argument for $\\mathsf{NP}$ or a function-binding hash function. Then, using indistinguishability obfuscation, we show how to support policies that can be computed by read-once bounded-space Turing machines. The latter construction is in fact a unique witness map for monotone-policy batch $\\mathsf{NP}$, and as such, also gives a SNARG for monotone-policy batch $\\mathsf{NP}$ where the size of the common reference string is sublinear in the number of instances.\r\n\r\nFinally, we demonstrate some immediate applications of succinct witness encryption for batch languages. We construct new succinct computational secret sharing schemes for CNFs, DNFs, and weighted threshold policies. We also show how to build distributed monotone-policy encryption, a notion that generalizes recent trustless primitives like distributed broadcast encryption and threshold encryption with silent setup.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we study the quantum security of key-alternating ciphers (KAC), a natural multi-round generalization of the Even\u2013Mansour (EM) cipher underlying many block cipher constructions, including AES. While the classical security of KAC and the quantum security of the $1$-round KAC (i.e. Even-Mansour) cipher are well understood, the quantum resistance of multi-round KAC remains largely unexplored. We focus on the $2$-round KAC construction, defined using public $n$-bit permutations $P_1$, $P_2$ and keys $k_0$, $k_1$, and $k_2$ as $E(x) = P_2(P_1(x \\oplus k_0) \\oplus k_1) \\oplus k_2.$ Our main contributions are as follows: \r\n\r\n1. Quantum Lower Bounds. We provide the first formal analysis showing that a $2$-round KAC is quantum-secure in both the $Q1$ and $Q2$ models. Specifically, in the $Q1$ model, a (non-adaptive) adversary must make at least $2^{2n/5}$ quantum queries to the public permutations and at least $2^{2n/5}$ classical queries to the cipher in order to distinguish it from a random permutation (in contrast to the classical lower bound of $2^{2n/3}$ queries). As a corollary, we show that in the $Q2$ model, a (non-adaptive) adversary requires $2^{n/4}$ quantum queries. To achieve such a result, we employ the quantum hybrid method along with recently proposed lifting theorems in the ideal cipher and random permutation oracle model. \r\n\r\n2. Quantum Key-Recovery Attack. We give the first nontrivial quantum key-recovery attack on multi-round KAC in the $Q1$ model where the adversary has quantum access to all of the public permutations. Our quantum attack applies to any $t$-round KAC and achieves quantum query complexity $O(2^{\\alpha n})$, where $\\alpha = \\frac{t(t+1)}{(t+1)^2 + 1}$, improving over the best known classical bound of $O(2^{\\alpha' n})$, where $\\alpha' = \\frac{t}{t+1}$, from Bogdanov et al. (EUROCRYPT 2012). The attack leverages a novel application of quantum walk algorithms specifically adapted to the KAC structure.\r\n\r\n3. The $Q1^*$ Model. To bridge the classical and $Q1$ settings, we introduce the $Q1^*$, in which the adversary has quantum superposition access to at most one permutation. This model is crucial for our $Q1$ lower bound and supports similar key-recovery attacks to Q1, using fewer quantum resources. We believe $Q1^*$ is of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "We analyze the post-quantum security of succinct interactive arguments constructed from interactive oracle proofs (IOPs) and vector commitment schemes. Specifically, we prove that an interactive variant of the \\emph{BCS transformation} is secure in the standard model against quantum adversaries when the vector commitment scheme is collapse binding.\r\n\r\nPrior work established the post-quantum security of Kilian's succinct interactive argument, a special case of the BCS transformation for one-message IOPs (i.e., PCPs). That analysis is inherently limited to one message because the reduction, like all prior quantum rewinding reductions, aims to extract classical information (a PCP string) from the quantum argument adversary. Our reduction overcomes this limitation by instead extracting a \\emph{quantum algorithm} that implements an IOP adversary; representing such an adversary classically may in general require exponential complexity.\r\n\r\nAlong the way we define \\emph{collapse position binding}, which we propose as the \\DoQuote{correct} definition of collapse binding for vector commitment schemes, eliminating shortcomings of prior definitions.\r\n\r\nAs an application of our results, we obtain post-quantum secure succinct arguments, in the standard model (no oracles), with the \\emph{best asymptotic complexity known}.",

    "abstract": "Threshold linearly homomorphic encryption (ThLHE) is a useful cryptographic tool for secure computation in multi-party settings, with applications in electronic voting, secure multiparty computation (MPC), and beyond. Although ThLHE offers significant advantages such as low communication overhead, its adoption in modern systems is hindered by a critical dilemma between efficiency and utility. Precisely, existing ThLHE schemes either suffer from high decryption complexity\u2014typically $\\mathcal{O}(N^2\\log N)$ or worse for $N$ parties\u2014or impose extra restrictions on the message space or participant set, limiting their practicality in large-scale and dynamic settings.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this work, we resolve this efficiency-utility dilemma for ThLHE by introducing a novel primitive termed message-space adapter (MeSA). By developing a lattice-based MeSA for exponential ElGamal (Exp-ElGamal), we mitigate the small-message restriction of Exp-ElGamal while preserving its efficient threshold decryption. This leads to the design of the first ThLHE scheme that achieves quasi-linear decryption complexity without restrictions on the message space or participant set. We implement a prototype of this new ThLHE scheme and validate the quasi-linear growth of its running time with respect to $N$.\r\n\r\nBeyond resolving this dilemma, we further extend the applications of our new ThLHE scheme. Specifically, we apply it to construct the first multi-party fully homomorphic encryption scheme with quasi-linear computation complexity and constant communication complexity, while supporting arbitrary threshold and dynamic participant set. This demonstrates the extra benefits of our ThLHE scheme with broader applicability.",

    "abstract": "Public-coin protocols are cryptographic protocols in which all messages sent by a specific party (typically the receiver or verifier) consist solely of random bits. These protocols have been extensively studied $\\textit{in the classical setting}$ due to their advantageous properties in several scenarios, such as the parallel repetition of interactive arguments, and the design of secure multi-party computation with low round complexity, among others. Curiously, $\\textit{post-quantum}$ constructions of public-coin protocols remain limited, particularly when optimization is sought in additional factors like round complexity or hardness assumptions.\r\n\r\nWe introduce the concept of $\\textit{almost-total puzzles}$, a novel cryptographic primitive characterized by two key properties: (i) hardness against any efficient adversary, and (ii) an \"almost-total\" guarantee of the existence of solutions, even when the puzzle generator is malicious. We demonstrate that this primitive can be derived from one-way functions in public-coin, requiring only two rounds. By leveraging this primitive, we obtain a family of new $\\textit{public-coin}$ results in both the classical and post-quantum settings, based on the $\\textit{minimal assumption} $ of (post-quantum) one-way functions, including: \r\n\r\n- five-round post-quantum extractable commitments and witness-indistinguishable arguments of knowledge, where the (knowledge) extractors achieve the $\\textit{coherently expected quantum-polynomial-time}$\r\n($\\mathsf{EQPT}_c$) simulation proposed by Lombardi, Ma, and Spooner [FOCS'22];\r\n\r\n- five-round classical extractable commitments that $\\textit{do not suffer from over extraction}$;\r\n\r\n- five-round classical delayed-input strong witness-indistinguishable arguments of knowledge, and delayed-input witness-hiding arguments of knowledge;\r\n\r\n- the five-round post-quantum analogue of the last item, but with the difference that (1) the input can be delayed until the third round, and (2) post-quantum arguments of knowledge are again defined w.r.t.  $\\mathsf{EQPT}_c$-simulation;\r\n\r\n- $O(\\log^* \\lambda)$-round post-quantum non-malleable commitments.",

    "abstract": "Poseidon and Poseidon2 are cryptographic hash functions designed for efficient zero-knowledge proof protocols and have been widely adopted in Ethereum applications. To encourage security research, the Ethereum Foundation announced a bounty program in November 2024 for breaking the Poseidon challenges, i.e. solving the CICO (Constrained Input, Constrained Output) problems for round-reduced Poseidon constructions. In this paper, we explain how to apply the Graeffe transform to univariate polynomial solving, enabling efficient interpolation attacks against Poseidon. We will provide an open-source code and details our approach for solving several challenges valued at $20000 in total. Compared to existing attacks, we improves 2^{13} and 2^{4.5} times in wall time and memory usage, respectively. For all challenges we solved, the cost of memory access turns out to be an essential barrier, which makes the security margin much larger than expected. We actually prove that the memory access cost for FFT grows as the 4/3-power of the input size, up to a logarithmic factor. This indicates the commonly used pseudo linear estimate may be overly conservative. This is very different from multivariate equation solving whose main bottleneck is linear algebra over finite fields. Thus, it might be preferable to choose parameters such that the best known attack is interpolation, as it presents more inherent hardness.",

    "abstract": "We revisit the security analysis of the permutation-based deterministic random bit generator~(DRBG) discussed by Coretti et al. at CRYPTO 2019. Specifically, we prove that their construction, based on the sponge construction, and hence called Sponge-DRBG in this paper, is secure up to $O\\left(\\min \\left\\{2^{\\frac{c}{2}}, 2^{\\frac{\\lambda}{2}}\\right\\}\\right)$ queries in the seedless robustness model, where $\\lambda$ is the required min-entropy and $c$ is the sponge capacity. This significantly improves the provable security bound from the existing $O\\left(\\min \\left\\{2^{\\frac{c}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{\\lambda}{2}}\\right\\}\\right)$ to the birthday bound. We also show that our bound is tight by giving matching attacks.\r\n\r\nAs the Multi-Extraction game-based reduction proposed by Chung et al. at Asiacrypt 2024 is not applicable to Sponge-DRBG in a straightforward manner, we further refine and generalize the proof technique so that it can be applied to a broader class of DRBGs to improve their provable security.\r\n \r\nWe also propose a new permutation-based DRBG, dubbed POSDRBG, with almost the optimal output rate $1$, outperforming the output rate $\\frac{r}{n}$ of Sponge-DRBG, where $n$ is the output size of the underlying permutation and $r=n-c$. We prove that POSDRBG is tightly secure up to $O\\left(\\min \\left\\{2^{\\frac{c}{2}}, 2^{\\frac{\\lambda}{2}}\\right\\}\\right)$ queries. Thus, to the best of our knowledge, POSDRBG is the first permutation-based DRBG that achieves the optimal output rate of 1, while maintaining the same level of provable security as Sponge-DRBG in the seedless robustness model.",

    "abstract": "In 2022, Antonov showed that SHA-256 does not satisfy some secure property that SPHINCS$^+$ needs, and a fogery attack based on this observation reduces the concrete classical security by approximately 40 bits of security. This illustrates a more general concern: the provable security of some hash-based signature schemes can be compromised when implemented with certain real-world hash functions, and motivates the need to design new functions with rigorous, provable security guarantees. Besides, it has been shown that from W-OTS to W-OTS$^+$, the security requirement for the hash function's collision resistance can be relaxed to second-preimage resistance (SPR), which means that it is possible to use some functions with SPR property to instantiate the underlying function family  $\\mathcal{F}_n$ in W-OTS$^+$, and obtain a provably secure W-OTS$^+$.\r\nIn this paper, we use multivariate quadratic functions (MQ functions) to  instantiate  $\\mathcal{F}_n$ in W-OTS$^+$, which yields the first provably secure W-OTS$^+.$ To prove its security, we need to derive the SPR property of MQ functions. The key is to show the $\\mathbf{NP}$-hardness of finding second preimages.\r\nFurthermore, we prove the multi-function, multi-target one-wayness (MM-OW) and the multi-function, multi-target second-preimage resistance (MM-SPR) of MQ functions, which implies the provable security of MQ-based W-OTS$^+$ in the multi-user setting, on the condition that the number of users is $O(n^{1-\\epsilon})$  for some $\\epsilon\\in (0,1)$, where $n$ is the security parameter.",

    "abstract": "$\\textsf{GCM}$ and $\\textsf{CCM}$ are block cipher (BC) based authenticated encryption modes. In multi-user (mu) security, a total number of BC invocations by all users $\\sigma$ and the maximum number of BC invocations per user $\\sigma_\\mathsf{u}$ are crucial factors. For $\\textsf{GCM}$, the tight mu-security bound has been identified as $\\frac{\\sigma_\\mathsf{u} \\sigma}{2^n} + \\frac{u p + u^2}{2^k}$, where $k$ and $n$ are respectively the key and block sizes, $u$ is the number of users, $p$ is the number of offline queries.In contrast, the $\\mathsf{CCM}$'s mu-security bound is still unclear. Two bounds of $\\frac{u \\sigma_\\mathsf{u}^2}{2^n} + \\frac{u p + u^2}{2^k}$ and $\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2^n} + \\frac{u p + u \\sigma}{2^k}$ have been derived by Luykx~et~al.~(Asiacrypt~2017) and Zhang~et~al.~(CCS~2024), respectively, but both are not tight and worse than the $\\textsf{GCM}$'s bound.  Moreover, methods to enhance mu security without disruptive changes in the scheme have been considered for $\\textsf{GCM}$, namely nonce randomization ($\\textsf{NR}$) to improve offline security and nonce-based key derivation ($\\textsf{KD}$) to improve online security, but their applicability to $\\textsf{CCM}$ has never been discussed. In this paper, we prove an improved mu-security bound of $\\textsf{CCM}$, which is tight, and reaches the $\\textsf{GCM}$'s bound. We then prove that $\\textsf{NR}$ and $\\textsf{KD}$ applied to $\\textsf{CCM}$ result in the same bounds for the case to $\\textsf{GCM}$. An important takeaway is that $\\textsf{CCM}$ is now proved to be as secure as $\\textsf{GCM}$. Moreover, we argue that $\\textsf{NR}$ and $\\textsf{KD}$ can be insufficient for some applications with massive data, and propose a new enhancement method called nonce-based and tag-based key derivation ($\\textsf{NTKD}$) that is applied to $\\textsf{GCM}$ and $\\textsf{CCM}$. We prove that the resulting schemes meet such real-world needs.",

    "abstract": "At the current state of the art, algebraic attacks are the most efficient method for finding preimages and collisions for arithmetization-oriented hash functions, such as the closely related primitives Poseidon/Poseidon2 and Neptune. In this paper, we revisit Gr\u00f6bner basis (GB) attacks that exploit subspace trails to linearize some partial rounds, considering both sponge and compression modes.\r\n\r\nStarting from Poseidon's original security evaluation, we identified some inaccuracies in the model description that may lead to misestimated round requirements. Consequently, we reevaluate and improve the proposed attack strategy. We find that depending on the concrete instantiation, the original security analysis of Poseidon under- or overestimates the number of rounds needed for security. Moreover, we demonstrate that GB attacks leveraging subspace trails can outperform basic GB attacks for Poseidon/Poseidon2 and Neptune.\r\n\r\nWe propose a variant of the previous attack strategy that exploits a crucial difference between Poseidon/Poseidon2 and Neptune: while Poseidon's inverse round functions have a high degree, Neptune's inverse external rounds maintain the same degree as the forward rounds. Using this new model, we demonstrate that Neptune's security in compression mode cannot be reduced to its security against the Constrained-Input-Constrained-Output (CICO) problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a concrete example has been provided where finding preimages is easier than solving the corresponding CICO problem.\r\n\r\nOur results emphasize the importance of considering the mode of operation in security analysis while confirming the overall security of Poseidon/Poseidon2 and Neptune against the presented algebraic attacks.",

    "abstract": "Symmetric primitives used in multi-party computation, fully homomorphic encryption, and zero-knowledge proofs are often defined over Finite Field $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$ with $q=2^t$ or an odd prime $p$. Integral attack is one of the most effective methods against such primitives due to the common use of low-degree non-linear layers. This in turn highlights the importance of a deeper understanding of degree growth. For ciphers defined over $\\mathbb{F}_{2^t}$, numerous works have explored the growth of the algebraic degree. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$. At CRYPTO 2020, Beyne et al. extended the integral cryptanalysis to $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ by comparing degree with $s(p-1)$ when using $p^s$ data. However, given that the precise degree evaluation remains fundamentally challenging and often computationally infeasible, one may lose better integral distinguishers.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present the first automatic search model over $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ based on the exact coefficient $\\mathcal{A}$ of the monomial $\\prod_{w=1}^{s}x_w^{p-1}$ contained in the algebraic representation. This model is constructed following the Computation-Traceback-Determine framework, where $\\mathcal{A}$ is represented by several sums of multinomial coefficients under specific conditions. The existence of integral properties is then transformed into a determination of whether these sums can consistently equal $0\\bmod{p}$. This determination is facilitated by four newly developed propositions based on Lucas Theorem. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we apply it to all variants of GMiMC. As a result, we achieve the best integral distinguishers for GMiMC-erf/-crf using large primes when they are used as block ciphers. For GMiMC-nyb/-mrf using 32/64-bit primes, our integral distinguishers cover more rounds than all other attacks. Meanwhile, all distinguishers we identified are no worse than those trivial ones predicted only considering the maximal degree. This shows the necessity of considering exact coefficients when searching for integral distinguishers over $\\mathbb{F}_p$. Our framework is further employed to assess the security of two HADES  designs: HadesMiMC and Poseidon2$^\\pi$. The results reveal that the full rounds at the beginning and end of HADES provide sufficient resistance against integral cryptanalysis.",

    "abstract": "Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) is an appealing and promising solution for privacy-preserving transformer inference to protect users' privacy. However, the huge computational overhead makes it unrealistic to apply FHE in real-world transformers for large language models (LLM). Current FHE-based approaches to secure transformer inference face significant performance challenges, with total latency exceeding 5 hours for 32-input batches.\r\nThe feedforward block, comprising a large-scale matrix multiplication followed by a GELU evaluation, is widely recognized as one of the most computationally intensive components in privacy-preserving transformer inference. In the state-of-the-art system NEXUS, evaluating the feedforward block incurs a total latency of 5,378 seconds, processing up to 32 inputs per batch. \r\nWe aim to reduce the latency and propose LEAF, a low-latency evaluation architecture for the feedforward block. LEAF introduces a novel combination of fast matrix multiplication and an asymptotically efficient algorithm for computing non-polynomial activations. When evaluated on the BERT-base model, LEAF reduces total latency to 53.4 seconds, offering a $100\\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art method in the same environment. Our implementations are available.",

    "abstract": "Following Gentry's seminal work (STOC 2009), Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) has made significant advancements and can even evaluate functions in the bootstrapping process, called functional bootstrapping. Recently, Liu and Wang (ASIACRYPT 2023) proposed a new approach to functional bootstrapping, which bootstrapped ciphertexts in 7ms amortized time. Their methods packed the secret key of the TFHE cryptosystem into a ciphertext of the BFV cryptosystem, followed by performing functional bootstrapping of TFHE within BFV. However, while this yields high amortized efficiency, it faces high latency and computational complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{t})$ ciphertext-ciphertext multiplications due to use of large BFV plaintext primes that serve as the TFHE ciphertext modulus, $t = 65537$, to maximize SIMD slots.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we adapt their techniques to achieve lower latency functional bootstrapping by relaxing the requirement for prime BFV plaintext modulus to prime powers, $t = p^r$. We first introduce an improved linear transformation stage, multiplying Laurent Polynomial packed secret key and ciphertexts, $a_{ij}$ and $sk_j$, evaluating a $\\mathbb{Z}_{p^r}$ linear map. With this, we reduce the number of operations needed to evaluate the linear phase of bootstrapping. Finally, we generalize their functional bootstrapping procedure from plaintext space $\\mathbb{Z}_t$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_{p^r}$ via leveraging the digit extraction algorithm, achieving a theoretical complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(r^2\\sqrt{p})$ ciphertext-ciphertext multiplications. Additionally, we enable a multi-valued bootstrapping scheme that permits the evaluation of multiple functions over a shared input. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of such a method for TFHE ciphertexts that relies predominantly on BFV-based techniques.\r\n\r\nIn our experiments, we achieve overall runtimes as low as 49.873s, representing latency reductions of at least $26\\times$, while noting a $19\\times$ slowdown in amortized performance.",

    "abstract": "In pairings-based cryptographic applications, final exponentiation with a large fixed exponent ensures distinct outputs for the Tate pairing and its derivatives. Despite notable advancements in optimizing elliptic curves with even embedding degrees, improvements for those with odd embedding degrees, particularly those divisible by \\(3\\), remain underexplored. This paper introduces three methods for applying cyclotomic cubing in final exponentiation and enhancing computational efficiency. The first allows for the execution of one cyclotomic cubing based on the final exponentiation structure. The second leverages some existing seeds structure to enable the use of cyclotomic cubing and extends this strategy to generate new seeds. The third allows generating sparse ternary representation seeds to apply cyclotomic cubing as an alternative to squaring. These optimizations improve performance by up to $19.3\\%$ when computing the final exponentiation for the optimal Ate pairing on $BLS15$ and $BLS27$, the target elliptic curves of this study.",

    "abstract": "In ToSC 2025(1), Jia et al. proposed an SAT-aided automatic search tool for the S-box design. A part of the functionality of this tool is to search for implementations of an S-box with good area and gate-depth complexity. However, it is well-known that the gate depth complexity cannot precisely reflect the latency of an implementation. To overcome this problem, Rasoolzadeh introduced the concept of latency complexity, a more precise metric for the latency cost of implementing an S-box than the gate depth complexity in the real world.\r\nIn this addendum, we adapt Jia et al.'s tool to prioritize latency as the primary metric and area as the secondary metric to search for good implementations for existing S-boxes. The results show that the combination of Jia et al.'s tool and Rasoolzadeh's latency complexity can lead to lower-latency S-box implementations. For S-boxes used in LBlock, Piccolo, SKINNY-64, RECTANGLE, PRESENT and TWINE, which are popular targets in this research line, we find new implementations with lower latency. We conducted synthesis comparisons of the area and latency under multiple standard libraries, where our results consistently outperformed in terms of latency. For example, for LBlock-S0, our solution reduces latency by around 50.0% \u223c73.8% compared to previous implementations in TSMC 90nm library with the latency-optimized synthesis option.",

    "abstract": "The sponge is a popular construction of hash function design. It operates with a $b$-bit permutation on a $b$-bit state, that is split into a $c$-bit inner part and an $r$-bit outer part. However, the security bounds of the sponge are most often dominated by the capacity $c$: If the length of the digest is $n$ bits, the construction achieves $\\min\\{n/2,c/2\\}$-bit collision resistance and $\\min\\{n,c/2\\}$-bit second preimage resistance (and a slightly more complex but similar bound for preimage resistance). In certain settings, these bounds are too restrictive. For example, the recently announced Chinese call for a new generation of cryptographic algorithms expects hash functions with 1024-bit digests and 1024-bit preimage and second preimage resistance, rendering the classical sponge design basically unusable, except with an excessively large permutation. We present the SPONGE-DM construction to salvage the sponge in these settings. This construction differs from the sponge by evaluating the permutation during absorption in a Davies-Meyer mode. We also present SPONGE-EDM, that evaluates potentially round-reduced permutations during absorption in Encrypted Davies-Meyer mode, and SPONGE-EDM$^c$, that optimizes the amount of feed-forward data in this construction. We prove that these constructions generically achieve $\\min\\{n/2,c/2\\}$-bit collision resistance as the sponge does, but they achieve $n$-bit preimage resistance and $\\min\\{n,c-\\log_2(\\alpha)\\}$-bit second preimage resistance, where $\\alpha$ is the maximum size of the first preimage in blocks. With such constructions, one could improve the security (resp., efficiency) without sacrificing the efficiency (resp., security) of hash-based signature schemes whose security relies solely on the (second) preimage resistance of the underlying hash functions. Also, one could use the $1600$-bit Keccak permutation with capacity $c=1088$ and rate $r=512$ to achieve $512$-bit collision resistance and $1024$-bit preimage and second preimage resistance, without making extra permutation calls. To encourage further cryptanalysis, we propose two concrete families of instances of SPONGE-EDM (expected to be weaker than SPONGE-DM), using SHA3 and Ascon. Moreover, we concretely demonstrate the security and performance advantages of these instances in the context of hashing and hash-based signing.",

    "abstract": "The Transfer of Ownership Protocol (TOOP) enables a secure transfer of assets from Bitcoin to other blockchains and back. This is achieved through a committee-based validation protocol that requires only 1-out-of-nhonest security. The protocol operates in distinct phases: the lock phase, where the initial setup and individual assets are locked on Bitcoin, and the unlocking with ownership transfer phase, where the asset is transferred to a possibly different legitimate owner. This protocol solves a limitation of all existing BitVM-like protocols that restricts the unlocking transfers to only addresses known and preregistered during lock and setup. Accordingly, our protocol avoids the financially costly, regulatory problematic, and congestion-prone front-and-reimburse paradigm. TOOP has been implemented for the first time in Cardinal, a protocol for wrapping Bitcoin Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTxOs) onto the Cardano blockchain, with Bitcoin Ordinals represented as Cardano Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).",

    "abstract": "Multiparty fully homomorphic encryption (MPFHE) is a generalization of (multi-key) fully homomorphic encryption ((MK)FHE) that lives on the cusp between multiparty computation (MPC) and FHE, enabling a computation over encrypted data using multiple keys. However, contrary to MKFHE it seeks to reduce the noise inflation based on the number of parties by allowing the parties to first compute shared data in MPC before executing the computation in FHE. Generally, MPFHE protocols have required ad-hoc constructions and adaptations to already existing protocols. In this work we present a new framework that standardizes the approach of MPFHE to allow the use of a broad spectrum of MPC and FHE protocols, while eliminating the noise inflation based on the participating number of parties. This presents the first ever multiparty FHE protocol which allows an arbitrary number of participants. We then show a case study of this using the FINAL scheme and show that we reduce the required key material by 40-99.9% compared to the MKFHE FINAL scheme, FINALLY, 8-71% compared to the AK\u00d6 scheme, and 65-70% compared to the Park-Rovira scheme. Moreover, we reduce the bootstrapping time for the AK\u00d6, Park-Rovira, and KMS schemes by 75-99.7%.",

    "abstract": "Registered functional encryption (RFE) is a generalization of public-key encryption that enables computation on encrypted data (like classical FE), but without needing a central trusted authority. Concretely, the users choose their own public keys and register their keys together with a function with an (untrusted) key curator. The key curator aggregates all of the individual public keys into a short master public key, which serves as the public key of the FE scheme.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we only know RFE constructions for restricted functionalities using standard assumptions, or for all circuits using powerful tools such as indistinguishability obfuscation, and only in the non-uniform model. In this work, we make progress on this front by providing the first lattice-based constructions of RFE for pseudorandom functionalities, where the model of computation is either non-uniform (unbounded depth circuits) or uniform (Turing machines). Intuitively, we call a functionality pseudorandom if the output of the circuit is indistinguishable from uniform for every input seen by the adversary. Security relies on LWE and a recently introduced primitive called pseudorandom FE (prFE), which currently can be instantiated from evasive LWE.\r\n\r\nWe illustrate the versatility of these new functionalities for RFE by leveraging them to achieve key-policy and ciphertext-policy registered attribute-based encryption and registered predicate encryption schemes (KP-RABE, CP-RABE and RPE) for both unbounded depth circuits and Turing machines. Existing RABE constructions support only bounded depth circuits, and prior to our work there neither existed RABE for uniform models of computation nor RPE. As an appealing feature, all our constructions enjoy asymptotic optimality in the sense that their parameters depend neither on the length of public attributes nor the size of policies.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, we can also improve on the state-of-the-art for classical attribute-based encryption (ABE) and predicate encryption (PE). Specifically, we obtain new constructions for KP-ABE, CP-ABE and PE for Turing machines with optimal asymptotic parameters. For KP-ABE, this is an in improvement in terms of efficiency, whereas for CP-ABE and PE we are not aware of any prior purely lattice-based construction supporting Turing machines.",

    "abstract": "In TCC 2018, Boneh, Ishai, Passel\u00e8gue, Sahai, and Wu propose candidates of weak and strong PRFs by evaluating linear functions over coprime moduli alternatively. Such PRFs can be evaluated by low-depth circuits and are MPC-friendly. However, they have not been able to base the security of their PRFs on well-formed assumptions other than assuming that the PRF constructions themselves are secure.  \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we formalize a new assumption called Learning with Alternating Moduli (LAM). We show that over certain large moduli, the LAM assumption is as hard as the Learning with Errors (LWE) assumption. For LAM over constant moduli, we do not know how to base its hardness on the LWE assumption. Instead, we provide\r\n    (i) polynomial-time attacks on LAM with constant prime-power moduli and certain constant non-prime-power moduli, and\r\n    (ii) evidence of the sub-exponential hardness of LAM with other moduli by analyzing the effect of typical attacks.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, we put forward two new attacks. The first attack is a recursive algorithm that solves LWE with certain constant composite moduli and error distributions. The algorithm extends the Arora-Ge algorithm for LWE from prime moduli to composite moduli, and it also solves LAM for certain parameters. The second attack is a polynomial-time attack that rules out the existence of weak PRFs in $\\mathsf{NC}^0[p]$ for any prime $p$.\r\n\r\nBased on our studies, we propose candidate weak PRFs in $\\mathsf{NC}^0[p_1,p_2]$ for some distinct primes $p_1,p_2$ based on LAM over constant moduli, or the Learning with Rounding (LWR) assumption over constant moduli. Compared to the weak PRF candidates by Boneh et al., our weak PRF candidates live in the same complexity class while having the advantage of being based on well-formed assumptions.",

    "abstract": "We initiate the study of a new abstraction \r\ncalled incremental decentralized data archival (${\\sf iDDA}$). \r\nSpecifically, imagine that there is an ever-growing, massive database such as a blockchain, a comprehensive  human knowledge base like Wikipedia,  or the Internet archive.  We want to build a decentralized archival of such datasets \r\nto ensure long-term robustness and sustainability.  \r\n\r\nWe identify several important properties\r\nthat an ${\\sf iDDA}$ scheme should satisfy. First, \r\nto promote heterogeneity and decentralization, \r\nwe want to encourage even weak nodes  with limited space (e.g., users' home computers) to contribute.  The minimum space requirement to contribute should be approximately independent of the data size.   Second, if a collection of nodes together receive rewards commensurate with contributing a total of $m$ blocks of space, then we want the following reassurances:  1) if $m$ is at least the database size, we should be able to reconstruct the entire dataset; and 2)  these nodes should actually be commiting roughly $m$ space in aggregate --- even when $m$ is much larger than the data size,  the nodes should be storing redundant copies of the database rather than storing just one copy, and yet impersonating arbitrarily many pseudonyms to get unbounded rewards.  \r\n\r\nWe propose new definitions  that mathematically formalize the aforementioned requirements of an ${\\sf iDDA}$ scheme. \r\nWe also devise an efficient construction in the random oracle model which satisfies the desired security requirements.   Our scheme incurs  only $\\widetilde{O}(1)$ audit cost, as well as  $\\widetilde{O}(1)$ update cost for both the publisher and each node, where $\\widetilde{O}(\\cdot)$ hides polylogarithmic factors. Further, the minimum space provisioning required to contribute is as small as polylogarithmic. \r\n\r\nOur construction exposes several interesting technical challenges. Specifically, we show that a straightforward application of the standard hierarchical data structure fails, since both our security definition and  the underlying cryptographic primitives we employ lack the desired compositional  guarantees. We devise novel techniques to overcome these compositional issues, resulting in a construction with provable security while still retaining efficiency. Finally, our new definitions also make a conceptual contribution, and lay the theoretical groundwork for the study of ${\\sf iDDA}$.   We raise several interesting open problems along this direction.",

    "abstract": "A proof of quantumness (PoQ) allows a classical verifier to efficiently test if a quantum machine is performing a computation that is infeasible for any classical machine. In this work, we propose a new approach for constructing PoQ protocols where soundness holds unconditionally assuming a bound on the memory of the prover, but otherwise no restrictions on its runtime. In this model, we propose two protocols:\r\n    1. A simple protocol with a quadratic gap between the memory required by the honest parties and the memory bound of the adversary. The soundness of this protocol relies on Raz's (classical) memory lower bound for matrix inversion (Raz, FOCS 2016).\r\n    2. A protocol that achieves an exponential gap, building on techniques from the literature on the bounded storage model (Dodis et al., Eurocrypt 2023).\r\n\r\nBoth protocols are also efficiently verifiable. Despite having worse asymptotics, our first protocol is conceptually simple and relies only on arithmetic modulo 2, which can be implemented with one-qubit Hadamard and CNOT gates, plus a single one-qubit non-Clifford gate.",

An important but often overlooked part of anonymous communication is the bootstrapping of new communication channels, generally assumed to occur out-of-band. However, if the bootstrapping discloses metadata, communication partners are revealed even if the channel itself is fully anonymized. We propose Sabot, the first anonymous bootstrapping protocol that achieves both strong cryptographic privacy guarantees and bandwidth-efficient communication. In Sabot, clients cooperatively generate a private relationship matrix, which encodes who wants to contact whom. Clients communicate with k \u2265 2 servers to obtain \u201ctheir\u201d part of the matrix and augment the received information using Private Information Retrieval (PIR) to learn about their prospective communication partners. Compared to previous solutions, Sabot achieves stronger privacy guarantees and reduces the bandwidth overhead by an order of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "Some of the most valuable applications of homomorphic encryption, such as encrypted machine learning inference, require efficient large-scale plaintext-ciphertext and ciphertext-ciphertext matrix multiplications. Current state-of-the-art techniques for matrix multiplications all build on the ability to pack many ciphertexts into a ciphertext and compute on them in a Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) manner. However, to fit the operation of matrix multiplication into this computational model, a large number of additional costly operations need to be performed, such as the rotation of elements between the plaintext slots.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose an orthogonal approach to performing encrypted matrix operations with BGV-like encryption schemes, where the plaintext and ciphertext spaces are generalized to a matrix ring of arbitrary dimension. To deal with the inherent problem of noncommutativity in the case of matrix rings, we present a new superoperator technique to better represent linear and quadratic expressions in the secret key, which allows for the relinearization of ciphertexts after multiplication. The security of the modified encryption schemes is based on Module-LWE with module rank equal to the dimension of the matrices. With this construction, we demonstrate that Ring-LWE, Module-LWE, and LWE are potentially equally efficient for homomorphic encryption, both in terms of useful information density and noise growth, only for different sizes of matrices.",

    "abstract": "Equivalence class signatures (EQS), introduced by Hanser\r\nand Slamanig (AC\u201914, J.Crypto\u201919), sign vectors of elements from a bi-\r\nlinear group. Their main feature is \u201cadaptivity\u201d: given a signature on a\r\nvector, anyone can transform it to a (uniformly random) signature on any\r\nmultiple of the vector. A signature thus authenticates equivalence classes\r\nand unforgeability is defined accordingly. EQS have been used to improve\r\nthe efficiency of many cryptographic applications, notably (delegatable)\r\nanonymous credentials, (round-optimal) blind signatures, group signa-\r\ntures and anonymous tokens.

    "abstract": "To prevent privacy-preserving digital assets from becoming instruments of despotism via unitary-executivist compliance regimes, we propose OptAttest, a hybrid zero-knowledge architecture. This system empowers users to optionally generate verifiable attestation history for the current (Hop 0) and immediately preceding (Hop 1) transactions involving their private commitments. For crucial 0-hop multi-list attestations, users employ Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) of claims from selected Verifiable Credentials (VCs). Users achieve per-transaction efficiency with diverse VC types by pre-computing and caching proofs of their VC validity. This approach avoids mandated adherence to singular, fallible external standards. Opted-in lightweight updates create cryptographic accumulator summaries, verified by network infrastructure (e.g., Layer 2 scaling solutions using Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machines), and are paired with user-managed Intermediate Attestation Data Packets (IADPs) containing detailed evidence. For comprehensive verification, users can then generate full recursive proofs from these IADPs for their attestation-enabled funds, leveraging native zkVM recursion. The protocol facilitates optional attestation generation, not enforcement, allowing downstream policy application. Aiming to cultivate a permissionless ethos, we propose a user-centric balance between privacy and verifiable accountability, distinct from models compelling broader data access. Folding schemes are noted as potential future enhancements for recursive proof efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the concept of incompressible encryption has emerged as a powerful enhancement to key-leakage resilience. In an incompressible encryption scheme, an adversary who intercepts ciphertexts is forced to dedicate a significant amount of memory to store them in full if they wish to extract any information about the plaintext later when the secret key becomes available. Given two messages, the security game involves two adversaries: the first adversary receives an encryption of one of the messages and produces a compressed state. Then, the second adversary, given both the secret key and the compressed state, attempts to determine which message was encrypted.\r\n\r\nSeveral positive results exist in incompressible cryptography. On the one hand, there are constructions based on minimal assumptions but with a poor rate (i.e., rate tends to 0). On the other hand, there are rate-1 constructions that achieve optimal efficiency but rely on strong cryptographic assumptions, such as obfuscation.\r\n\r\nA stronger security notion, known as everlasting security, has been proposed for incompressible encryption. In this formulation, the second adversary,  who receives the compressed state and the secret key, is allowed to be computationally unbounded. While this notion is conceptually appealing, no constructions of everlasting incompressible encryption are currently known, regardless of the underlying assumption or even in idealized models.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we give the first construction of everlasting incompressible encryption. In fact, we show that everlasting incompressible encryption is inherent in any sufficiently secure public-key encryption scheme. Specifically, we prove that any public-key encryption scheme with subexponential security (when instantiated with an appropriate security parameter) already satisfies the definition of everlasting incompressible encryption with subexponential security. Furthermore, our scheme achieves rate-1, improving upon existing results even for the weaker notion of standard incompressible encryption.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the large block cipher Vistrutah, featuring 256- and 512-bit block sizes. Vistrutah is an iterated cipher where each \"step\" applies two AES rounds to each 128-bit block of the state, followed by a cell permutation across the entire state.\r\nBuilding upon established design principles from Simpira, Haraka, Pholkos, and ASURA, Vistrutah achieves high performance by leveraging AES instructions.\r\n\r\nFor each component of Vistrutah, we conducted a systematic evaluation of functions that can be efficiently implemented across different vector instruction set architectures.\r\nOur evaluation methodology combines latency estimation with security analysis, aiming to maximize the ratio of \"bits of security per unit of time.\"\r\nThis approach ensures we achieve the highest security or, equivalently, the best performance for this class of designs.\r\nImplementation results confirm the accuracy of our latency model.\r\n\r\nWe support our security claims with a comprehensive cryptanalysis.\r\n\r\nA core design principle is the use of an inline key schedule: all round keys are computed during each encryption or decryption operation without requiring memory storage.\r\nKey schedules like the AES's must precompute and store round keys in memory for acceptable performance. This creates security vulnerabilities: such implementations become more susceptible to memory read oracles and, as demonstrated by Kamal and Youssef, more vulnerable to cold boot attacks. We consider these designs unsuitable for modern software security requirements. Vistrutah's approach minimizes leakage to at most one value during context switches. Furthermore, expensive key schedules reduce key agility, limiting the design of modes of operation.\r\n\r\nVistrutah is particularly well-suited for Birthday-Bound modes of operation, including Synthetic IV modes and Accordion modes for 256-bit block ciphers. It also serves effectively as a building block for compression functions (such as Matyas-Meyer-Oseas) in wide Merkle\u2013Damg\\aa rd hash functions. Additionally, it can implement \"ZIP\" wide pseudo-random functions as recently proposed by Fl\u00f3rez-Guti\u00e9rrez et al. in 2024.\r\n\r\nOur cryptanalysis includes consideration of related-key security for two key reasons. First, strong related-key security demonstrates the robustness of both the key schedule and the cipher as a whole. Second, in counter-mode-based modes, Vistrutah's ability to change key with no overhead may allow the designer of a mode of operation to place counters (or values obtained from other update functions) in the key input rather than the plaintext input.\r\nThis approach makes it easier to achieve Beyond the Birthday Bound security.\r\n\r\nAs a by-product of this research, we identified design flaws in Ghidle that affect both its security and performance.\r\nOur security analysis accounts for these weaknesses.\r\nWe also developed Vistrutah-B, a variant of Vistrutah that addresses Ghidle's issues while maintaining comparable performance in most aspects. Nevertheless, Vistrutah retains superior diffusion properties.",

    "abstract": "At Crypto 2009, Heninger and Shacham presented a branch-and-prune algorithm for reconstructing RSA private keys given a random fraction of its private components. This method is widely adopted in side-channel attacks, and its complexity is closely related to the specific leakage pattern encountered. In this work, we identified a novel leakage model in the Miller-Rabin primality test implemented in OpenSSL. Under certain side-channel attacks against fixed-window modular exponentiation (e.g., recovering the least significant $b$ bits from each window), the proposed model enables staggered recovery of bits in $p$ and $q$, reducing uncertainty in key reconstruction. In particular, this model includes previously undocumented scenarios where full key recovery is achievable without branching. To understand how the proposed leakage model could contribute to attacks on modular exponentiation, we investigated the global and local behavior of key reconstruction. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed scenarios enable more efficient key reconstruction and retain this advantage when additional erasure bits are introduced. Moreover, in specific cases, successful reconstruction remains achievable within practical time even if the bits obtained are less than 50%. Finally, we conducted a series of experiments to confirm the practicality of our assumption, successfully recovering the lower 4 bits from each 6-bit window.",

    "abstract": "Distributed point functions (DPFs), introduced in 2014, are a widely used primitive in secure computation for a wide variety of applications. However, until now, constructions for DPFs with polylogarithmic-size keys have been known only for the two-party setting. We propose a scheme for a polylogarithmic-size DPF for an arbitrary number of parties. We use a technique where a secret-shared vector is mapped to collinear vectors by public matrices serves as an invariant for off-path leaves. We show, using a technique by Shamir, that when we work over Z_pq , these vectors are hard to compute if factoring is hard.\r\nWe also show that our scheme is a secure DPF, provided that two new assumptions hold, one of which is related to Generic Group Model and the other to MinRank. The output of our scheme is in the exponent in some group where Diffie-Hellman type problems are hard. Although this limits the usability of our scheme, we believe that our scheme is the first distributed point function for more than two parties with a key size that is polylogarithmic in the size of the domain and that does not use fully homomorphic encryption.",

    "abstract": "RIPEMD-128 is an ISO/IEC standard hash function based on a double-branch Merkle-Damg\u00e5rd structure. Its compression function includes two branches with distinct Boolean functions and message expansion permutations. To perform a collision attack, differential characteristics must be constructed simultaneously for both branches under the same message word difference, and the message modification order must align with conditions in both branches. These factors make collision attacks on (reduced) RIPEMD-128 highly challenging.\r\nIn 2014, an attack on 40 steps of RIPEMD-128 was achieved by Wang with no state differences in round 3. In this work, we analyze message permutation properties and propose two new structures for creating message differences. These structures enable high-probability local collisions in both branches of round 3, extending the attack to more steps. Notably, the second structure can eliminate all state differences in round 3, allowing the attack to cover more than three whole rounds.\r\nTo ensure practical attacks, we limit the number of conditions based on our message modification strategy and use multi-step message modification techniques to control more conditions. As a result, we successfully generate colliding message pairs for 46-step and 54-step reduced RIPEMD-128, with time complexities of approximately $2^{42}$ and $2^{54}$, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The LowMC-based post-quantum signature scheme Picnic was selected as a third-round candidate for NIST PQC, attracting wide attention to the design of efficient and secure post-quantum signature schemes using Symmetric Techniques for Advanced Protocols (STAP). Symmetric primitives designed for advanced protocols such as secure multi-party computation (MPC), fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), and zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems, with the goal of reducing the number of multiplication operations, are  referred to as arithmetic-oriented (AO) primitives. These cryptographic primitives are typically constructed over large finite fields, which makes classical statistical analysis methods like differential and linear cryptanalysis inefficient. Due to their inherent algebraic properties, the mainstream security evaluation approaches are based on algebraic attacks. In this paper, we analyze the security of the MPC-friendly primitives \\textsc{Rain} (CCS 2022) and AIM (CCS 2023) used in the post-quantum signature schemes Rainier and AIMer. Existing algebraic attacks on \\textsc{Rain} and AIM were conducted over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. We propose a novel algebraic attack over $\\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ that uses the polynomial decomposition to reduce degrees of equations. By further combining with the guess-and-determine technique, meet-in-the-middle modeling, and  resultant, we are able to attack \\textsc{Rain} and the full AIM.  Specifically, we successfully attacked 2-round \\textsc{Rain} with $2^{73.7}/2^{107.0}/2^{138.9}$ primitive calls, 3-round \\textsc{Rain} with $2^{160.6}/2^{236.0}/2^{311.1}$ primitive calls, for the $128/192/256$-bit key. For the full AIM, we successfully attacked it with $2^{114.0}/2^{163.2}/2^{228.3}$ primitive calls for the $128/192/256$-bit key. The attack complexities mainly lie in solving univariate polynomial equations and computing resultants, and hence the complexity evaluations are accurate.",

    "abstract": "Contrary to expectation, we show that simulation-based selective-opening security (SSO) does not imply indistinguishability-based selective opening security (ISO) in the CCA setting, making them incomparable in the presence of either encryption randomness leakage (sender opening) or secret key leakage (receiver opening). This contrasts the CPA case, where SSO-CPA is known to be strictly stronger than ISO-CPA in the presence of sender and/or receiver opening. Our separation result holds relative to all message distributions with sufficiently high min-entropy. On the other hand, restricting to message distributions with low enough min-entropy gives rise to an implication.\r\nOur separation result does not rely on the presence of selective openings. At a glance, this may seem to contradict known equivalence results between indistinguishability, semantic security, and selective opening security under trivial openings. We reconcile the apparent contradiction by showing that the selective-opening CCA landscape splits into a \u201chigh-entropy\u201d and a \u201clow-entropy\u201d world which must be considered separately.",

    "abstract": "Symmetric-key authenticated key establishment (AKE) protocols are particularly well suited in resource constraint environments such as internet of things (IoT) devices. Moreover, they often rely on better understood assumptions than asymmetric ones. In this paper, we review the security model for symmetric-key AKE protocols. We show why several existing models allow trivial attacks while they do not protect against some non-trivial ones. We fix these issues with our new security definitions.\r\n\r\nWe show that the protocols $\\textrm{LP2}$ and $\\textrm{LP3}$ of Boyd et al. do not satisfy the claimed security properties. We propose a new 2-message protocol based on them, called $\\textrm{LP2+}$. This protocol is proved to satisfy correctness, weak synchronization robustness, entity authentication, key indistinguishability and, as a consequence, it admits perfect forward secrecy. An instantiation of $\\textrm{LP2+}$ is presented, whose security only relies on that of a pseudo-random function (PRF). Its total execution time in normal cases is dominated by only 14 evaluations of the PRF, making it a lightweight protocol that is particularly well suited for resource-constrained environments such as IoT devices.\r\n\r\nThe flaws found in the security models as well as in the security arguments could have been avoided with precise and detailed proofs. We thus take this paper as an opportunity to advocate for thorough security proofs. Therefore, we have made the choice of rigor over concision.",

    "abstract": "After more than half a decade since its initiation, NIST declared Ascon as the winner of the LwC competition. In the first public draft of AsconAEAD128, NIST recognized that Ascon has limitations when used in multi-user applications. To mitigate this, NIST prescribed the use of a \\(256\\)-bit key in multi-user applications and produced an instantiation on how to process this extra key size in the current AsconAEAD128 API. While doing so, they identified a limitation of this new scheme (which we refer to as mu-Ascon in this document): mu-Ascon is vulnerable to committing attack and hence cannot be used in cases where committing security is required. On the other hand, the full key-binding property in Ascon, which separated it from other sponge-type constructions, has been used to show that Ascon is much stronger in the sense that it presents a key recovery resistance even in the case where some intermediate state is recovered. We remark that the current mu-Ascon has the limitation that only a partial key is bound during initialization and finalization. In this work, we propose some alternative instantiations of AsconAEAD128 API for multi-user applications. In comparison with the current mu-Ascon proposal, our first construction Ascon-256.v2 guarantees CMT-4 committing security up to 64 bits, and our second construction Ascon-256.v3 leads to both CMT-4 committing security and full 256-bit key binding. Structurally, our instantiations use only an extra-permutation call to provide these extra security features compared to mu-Ascon, which has a negligible overhead in terms of performance (given the lightweight nature of the Ascon permutation).",

    "abstract": "The smoothing parameter is a cornerstone concept in lattice-based cryptography. Traditionally defined using the \\( L^{\\infty} \\) distance, this standard formulation can be overly stringent compared to the \\( L^1 \\) (or statistical) distance more commonly employed in cryptographic contexts. Recent work has proposed relaxed definitions based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and \\( L^1 \\) distance, thereby loosening the constraints required for the distance to vanish. However, the additive nature of the \\( L^1 \\) distance can be limiting for cryptographic applications where probability preservation is essential. In this paper, we introduce the {R\u00e9nyi smoothing parameter} of a lattice, based on R\u00e9nyi divergence, to address this limitation. The advantages of R\u00e9nyi divergence in cryptographic settings are well known thanks to its multiplicative nature. The R\u00e9nyi smooting parameter provides a tunable framework that interpolates between the \\( L^1 \\) and \\( L^{\\infty} \\) distances, offering enhanced flexibility. We present two complementary methods to study the averaging behavior of the R\u00e9nyi flatness factor: one uses classical tools such as the Minkowski-Hlawka ensemble and Rogers\u2019 formula for computing lattice function moments; the other employs Construction A lattices derived from random codes. Finally, we illustrate how this new perspective yields improvements in lattice-based cryptographic constructions.",

    "abstract": "Secret sharing is a foundational cryptographic primitive for sharing secret keys in distributed systems. In a classical threshold setting, it involves a dealer who has a secret, a set of $n$ users to whom shares of the secret are sent, and a threshold $t$ which is the minimum number of shares required to recover the secret. These schemes offer an all-or-nothing security approach where less than $t$ shares reveal no information about the secret. But these guarantees are threatened by side-channel attacks which can leak partial information from each share. Initiated by Benhamouda et. al. (CRYPTO'18), the security of such schemes has been studied for precise and worst-case bounded leakage models. However, in practice, side-channel attacks are inherently noisy. In this work, we propose a noisy leakage model for secret sharing, where each share is independently leaked to an adversary corrupted by additive noise in the underlying field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. Under this model, we study the security of linear secret sharing schemes, and show bounds on the mutual information (MI) and statistical distance (SD) security metrics. We do this by using the MacWilliams' identity from the theory of error-correcting codes. For a given secret, it enables us to bound the the statistical deviation of the leaked shares from uniform as $\\delta^t$, where $\\delta$ is the Fourier bias of the added noise. Existing analyses for the security of linear $(n,t)$-threshold schemes only bound the SD metric, and show resilience for schemes with $t \\ge 0.668n$. In this work, we show that these constraints are artifacts of the bounded leakage model. In particular, we show that $(n,t)$-threshold schemes over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ with $t \\ge \\tau (n+1)$ leak $\\mathcal{O}(q^{-2t(\\gamma+1-1/\\tau)})$ bits about the secret, given the bias of added noise satisfies $\\delta \\le q^{-\\gamma}$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt towards understanding the side-channel security of linear secret sharing schemes for the MI metric.",

    "abstract": "Secure multiparty computation allows multiple parties to jointly compute a function while maintaining security even in the presence of malicious adversaries. There are two types of adversaries in the literature: static adversaries, which choose the parties to corrupt before the protocol begins; and adaptive adversaries, which can corrupt parties during the execution of the protocol based on the messages exchanged by the parties. While adaptive security provides a more robust security guarantee, it may require too much in certain scenarios. Indeed, the adversary must allocate some of its resources to corrupt the parties; however, certain parties might be more susceptible to corruption, for instance, if they have not updated their operating system to the latest version.\r\n\r\nTo address this, we introduce a new security notion called \\emph{dynamic security}. Here, adversaries may corrupt new parties \\emph{during and after} the protocol's execution, but \\emph{cannot choose} targets based on the messages. A protocol is said to be $(t,h)$-dynamically secure if it is possible to simulate any adversary that can corrupt up to $t$ parties during the execution and $h$ thereafter. Dynamic security provides meaningful security for many real-world scenarios. Moreover, it circumvents known lower bounds on the communication complexity of adaptive security, allowing for more efficient protocols such as committee-based ones, which would be insecure against adaptive adversaries.\r\n\r\nWe further explore dynamic security and establish the following results.\r\n1. We show a surprising connection between dynamic security and the seemingly unrelated notion of security with friends and foes (FaF security), introduced by Alon et al. (CRYPTO 2020), which aims to protect honest parties not only from adversaries but also against other honest parties. The notion of $(t,h)$-\\emph{strong FaF security} strengthens this by requiring the simulatability of the joint view of any $t$ malicious parties alongside any $h$ honest parties to be indistinguishable from their real-world view. We show that $(t,h)$-dynamic security and $(t,h)$-strong FaF security are equivalent.\r\n\r\n2. We consider the feasibility of $(t,h)$-dynamic security and show that every $n$-party functionality can be computed with computational $(t,h)$-dynamic security (with guaranteed output delivery) if and only if $2t+h<n$. By our previous result, this also solves an open problem left by Alon et al. on the feasibility of strong FaF security.",

    "abstract": "Multi-server Private Information Retrieval (PIR) is a cryptographic primitive that allows a client to retrieve an item of a database shared by multiple servers without revealing the index. This paper addresses the problem of error correction in multi-server PIR, enabling the client to obtain the item even when some servers provide incorrect responses. In a dishonest-majority setting where the majority of servers may introduce errors, it is known that the client can no longer uniquely determine the correct value. Previous approaches in this setting have typically settled for relaxed guarantees that the client can only reject incorrect values. However, these guarantees are substantially weak, as they only indicate the presence of errors without providing any information about the desired item. In this paper, we explore a more natural alternative called list-decodable PIR, which ensures that the client receives a small list of candidate values one of which is correct. We provide the first formal definition of list-decodable PIR and study its basic properties including a fundamental lower bound on the number of servers and the difficulty of simulation-based security definitions. We propose generic constructions of list-decodable PIR from any semi-honest PIR protocols, each offering different trade-offs. Our constructions improve upon the communication complexity of the only previously known protocol satisfying our definition. Furthermore, they achieve communication complexity comparable to that of the currently best known semi-honest PIR protocols.",

    "abstract": "Secure multiparty computation (MPC) is a cryptographic primitive which enables multiple parties to jointly compute a function without revealing any extra information on their private inputs. Bottleneck complexity is an efficiency measure that captures the load-balancing aspect of MPC protocols, defined as the maximum amount of communication required by any party. In this work, we study the problem of establishing lower bounds on the bottleneck complexity of MPC protocols. While the previously known techniques for lower bounding total communication complexity can also be applied to bottleneck complexity, they do not provide nontrivial bounds in the correlated randomness model, which is commonly assumed by existing protocols achieving low bottleneck complexity, or they are applied only to functions of limited practical interest. We propose several novel techniques for lower bounding the bottleneck complexity of MPC protocols. Our methods derive nontrivial lower bounds even in the correlated randomness model and apply to practically relevant functions including the sum function and threshold functions. Furthermore, our lower bounds demonstrate the optimality of some existing MPC protocols in terms of bottleneck complexity or the amount of correlated randomness.",

    "abstract": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLM) has brought about a new wave productivity, revolutionizing business operations while keeping cost relatively low. The human-like interface of LLM enables it to be easily integrated with business functions, thereby freeing up precious human resources for more complex, valuable tasks. However, due to the intensive computation and memory requirements of LLM inference, it is preferable and cheaper to deploy LLMs with the Cloud Service Providers (CSP) that offer high performance computation resources and low-latency networking. Nevertheless, privacy concerns have been raised about the possibility of data leakage to the CSP. In this work, we seek to address such privacy concerns through the use of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). FHE enables the CSP to work on data in its encrypted form, thus ensuring that the data stay private and secure. We propose the implementation of LLM inference with FHE. While a series of prior work have demonstrated that it is possible to execute LLM inference in a private manner, it remains a challenge to design a solution that is practical.\r\nOur contributions are as follows: We provide the first end-to-end open-source implementation of a non-interactive transformer inference with FHE. We report an amortized time of 9.6 minutes of one input with 128 tokens when evaluating the BERT model on CPU. Our packing methods for encrypted matrices remove the need to repack ciphertext between encrypted matrix multiplication and activation layers. Additionally, we introduce interleaved batching to eliminate the internal rotations during ciphertext matrix multiplications. Our approach also avoids HE rotations in evaluations of the softmax and layerNorm, leading to a speedup of 4.22\u00d7 and 122\u00d7 than existing works respectively. Our implementation supports arbitrary token lengths, in contrast with existing solutions that requires a full token embedding. Our implementation can be found at GitHub.",

    "abstract": "Private Simultaneous Messages (PSM) is a kind of secure multiparty computation with minimal interaction pattern and minimal security requirement.  A PSM protocol is said to be with universal reconstruction for a given function family if the algorithm of the referee (the output party) is independent of a function to be computed and the referee cannot infer the function from a protocol execution.  In a recent work by Eriguchi and Shinagawa (EUROCRYPT 2025), they proposed a compiler to obtain a PSM protocol for symmetric functions from PSM protocols with universal reconstruction for symmetric functions with smaller domains.  They also constructed the latter PSM protocols with universal reconstruction, by which the former PSM protocol achieves communication complexity better than the previously known protocols.  In this paper, we construct the latter PSM protocols with universal reconstruction for symmetric functions more efficiently; the communication complexity is exponentially (in the input range) smaller than the protocols by Eriguchi and Shinagawa.  As a consequence, we also obtain a PSM protocol (and also an ad-hoc PSM protocol and a robust PSM protocol) for symmetric functions that is more efficient than their protocol.  Technically, a main ingredient of their protocols is a linear and injective encoding of histograms for the input elements, and our improvement is realized by finding a more efficient encoding of the histograms.",

    "abstract": "Suppose that we are given a weak \\emph{Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge} (NIZK) proof system for NP with non-negligible soundness and zero-knowledge errors, denoted by $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, respectively. Is it possible to to reduce these errors to a negligible level? This problem, known as NIZK amplification, was introduced by Goyal, Jain, and Sahai (Crypto'19) and was further studied by Bitansky and Geier (Crypto'24).\r\nThe latter work provides amplification theorems for proofs and arguments, assuming the existence of one-way functions and public-key encryption, respectively. Unfortunately, their results only apply when the security level, $1 - (\\alpha + \\beta)$, is a constant bounded away from zero. Amplifying NIZK with an inverse polynomial security level remains an open problem and was stated as the main open question in both works.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we resolve the NIZK amplification problem and show how to amplify any non-trivial NIZK proof system that has a noticeable, inverse-polynomial level of security. As in previous works, we amplify proofs and arguments assuming the existence of one-way functions and public-key encryption, respectively. Furthermore, assuming the existence of collision-resistant hash functions, we preserve, for the first time, properties such as statistical zero-knowledge and proof succinctness.\r\n\r\nOur main technical contribution is a new \\emph{leakage-resilient secure multiparty} protocol that computes any public-output functionality with information-theoretic security against an adversary that corrupts an arbitrary subset of parties and obtains bounded leakage from each honest party. Our protocol operates in the pairwise correlated randomness model. Previous works relied on stronger setup assumptions in the form of $n$-wise correlations and either supported a smaller corruption threshold or suffered from an exponential dependency on the number of parties. To transform our protocol into a NIZK amplifier, we introduce a new intermediate notion of \\emph{leakage-resilient NP secret sharing}, that may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "A two-party fuzzy private set intersection (PSI) protocol between Alice and Bob with input sets $A$ and $B$ allows Alice to learn nothing more than the points of Bob that are ``$\\delta$-close'' to its points in some metric space $\\texttt{dist}$. More formally, Alice learns only the set $\\{ b\\ |~\\texttt{dist}{(a,b)} \\leq \\delta , a \\in A,b\\in B\\}$ for a predefined threshold $\\delta$ and distance metric $\\texttt{dist}$, while Bob learns nothing about Alice's set.  Fuzzy PSI is a valuable privacy tool in scenarios where private set intersection needs to be computed over imprecise or measurement-based data, such as GPS coordinates or healthcare data. Previous approaches to fuzzy PSI rely on asymmetric cryptographic primitives, generic two-party computation (2PC) techniques like garbled circuits, or function secret sharing methods, all of which are computationally intensive and lead to poor concrete efficiency.\r\n\r\nThis work introduces a new modular framework for fuzzy PSI, {primarily built on efficient symmetric key primitives}. Our framework reduces the design of efficient fuzzy PSI to a novel variant of oblivious transfer (OT), which we term distance-aware random OT (da-ROT). This variant enables the sender to obtain two random strings $(r_0, r_1)$, while the receiver obtains one of these values $r_b$,  depending on whether the receiver\u2019s input keyword $a$ and the sender\u2019s input keyword $b$ are close in some metric space i.e., $\\texttt{dist}{(a,b)} \\leq \\delta$. The da-ROT can be viewed as a natural extension of traditional OT, where the condition (choice bit) is known to the receiver. We propose efficient constructions for da-ROT based on standard OT techniques tailored for small domains, supporting distance metrics such as the Chebyshev norm, the Euclidean norm, and the Manhattan norm. \r\n\r\nBy integrating these da-ROT constructions, our fuzzy PSI framework achieves up to a $14\\times$ reduction in communication cost and up to a $54\\times$ reduction in computation cost compared to previous state-of-the-art protocols, across input set sizes ranging from $2^8$ to $2^{16}$. Additionally, we extend our framework to compute fuzzy PSI cardinality and fuzzy join from traditional PSI-related functionalities. All proposed protocols are secure in the semi-honest model.",

    "abstract": "While popular messaging apps already offer end-to-end confidentially, end-to-end metadata privacy is still far from being practical. Although several meta-data hiding systems have been developed and some like Tor have been popular, the proposed solutions lack in one or more aspects: the Tor network is prone to easy low-resourced attacks, and most others solely focus on anonymity for senders or receivers but do not both. Some recent solutions do consider end-to-end anonymity, however, they put significant restrictions on how users use the system. Particularly, the receivers must stay online or trust online servers that receive messages on behalf of receivers. This work presents a scalable end-to-end anonymity messaging system, $\\mathsf{ORAM}^{-}$, that overcomes the mentioned issues and restrictions. It stems from a key observation that combining the recently-emerged oblivious message retrieval (OMR) primitive with oblivious shuffling can offer the desired end-to-end anonymity without severely restricting the number of messages a sender may send or a receiver may receive. We build our solution using two non-colluding servers and recent OMR protocol HomeRun and a compatible oblivious shuffle protocol. We then extend our solution to allow larger messages by employing a novel two-server distributed oblivious RAM technique, called $\\mathsf{ORAM}^{-}$. Our performance analysis demonstrates that with the increase in the number and size of messages, the performance improvement brought by $\\mathsf{ORAM}^{-}$ becomes higher. Specifically, for $2^{20}$ messages of size 1KB, our scheme only needs $5.577$ s to transmit a message.",

    "abstract": "A Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol allows two parties to jointly establish a cryptographic key, where the only information shared in advance is a low-entropy password. The first efficient PAKE protocol whose security does not rely on the random oracle model is the one by Katz, Ostrovsky and Yung (KOY, EUROCRYPT 2001). Unfortunately, the KOY protocol has only been proven secure in the game-based setting, and it is unclear whether KOY is secure in the stronger Universal Composability (UC) framework, which is the current security standard for PAKE.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we present a thorough study of the UC-security of KOY. Our contributions are two-fold:\r\n\r\n    1. We formally prove that the KOY protocol is not UC-secure;\r\n    2. We then show that the UC-security of KOY holds in the Algebraic Group Model, under the Decisional Square Diffie-Hellman (DSDH) assumption.\r\n\r\nOverall, we characterize the exact conditions under which KOY is UC-secure. Interestingly, the DSDH assumption is stronger than DDH under which KOY can be proven game-based secure, which reveals some subtle gaps between the two PAKE security notions that have never been studied.",

    "abstract": "We show that the Negi-Kumar certificateless ring signature scheme  [Wirel. Pers. Commun. 134(4): 1987-2011 (2024)] is insecure against forgery attack.  The signer's public key $PK_j$ and secret key $PSK_j$ are simply invoked to  compute the hash value $H_{2_j}=h_5(m_j\\|PSK_j\\|PK_j\\|t_j)$,  which cannot be retrieved by the verifier for checking their dependency.  The explicit dependency between  the public key  and secret key is not properly used to construct some intractable problems, such as   Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm (ECDL), Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH), and Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH).  An adversary can find an efficient signing algorithm functionally equivalent to the valid signing algorithm. The findings in this note could be helpful for the newcomers who are not familiar with the designing techniques for certificateless ring signature.",

    "abstract": "A multi-message multi-recipient Public Key Encryption (mmPKE) enables batch encryption of multiple messages  for multiple independent recipients in one go, significantly reducing costs, particularly bandwidth, compared to the trivial solution of encrypting each message individually.  This capability is especially critical in the post-quantum setting, where ciphertext length is typically significantly larger than the corresponding plaintext. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we first observe that the generic construction of mmPKE from reproducible PKE proposed by Bellare et al. (PKC \u201903) does not apply in the lattice-based setting because existing lattice-based PKE schemes do not fit the notion of reproducible PKE. To this end, we first extend their construction by proposing a new variant of PKE, named extended reproducible PKE (XR-PKE), which enables the reproduction of ciphertexts via additional hints. However, standard lattice-based PKE schemes, such as Kyber (EuroS&P '18), do not readily satisfy the XR PKE requirements. To construct XR-PKE from lattices, we introduce a novel technique for precisely estimating the impact of such hints on the ciphertext security while also establishing suitable parameters. This enables us to instantiate the first CPA-secure mmPKE and Multi-Key Encapsulation Mechanism (mmKEM) from the standard Module Learning with Errors (MLWE) lattice assumption, named mmCipher-PKE and mmCipher-KEM, respectively. We then extend our works to the identity-based setting and construct the first mmIBE and mmIB-KEM schemes. As a bonus contribution, we explore generic constructions of adaptively secure mmPKE, achieving security against adaptive corruption and chosen-ciphertext attacks.\r\n\r\nWe also provide an efficient implementation and thorough evaluation of the practical performance of our mmCipher. Our results show that mmCipher provides significant bandwidth and computational savings in practice, compared to the state-of-the-art. For example, for 1024 recipients, our mmCipher-KEM achieves a 23~45 times reduction in bandwidth overhead, reaching within 4~9% of the plaintext length (near optimal bandwidth), while also offering a 3~5 times reduction in computational cost.",

    "abstract": "The standard notion of security for threshold signature schemes is static security, where the set of corrupt parties is assumed to be fixed before protocol execution. In this model, the adversary may corrupt up to t\u22121 out of a threshold of t parties. A stronger notion of security for threshold signatures considers an adaptive adversary, who may corrupt parties dynamically based on its view of the protocol execution, learning the corrupted parties\u2019 secret keys as well as their states. Adaptive security of threshold signatures has become an active area of research recently due to ongoing standardization efforts. Of particular interest is full adaptive security, the analogue of static security, where the adversary\r\nmay adaptively corrupt a full t\u22121 parties.\r\n\r\nWe present a plausible attack on the full adaptive security of threshold Schnorr signature schemes with public key shares of the form $pk_i = g^{sk_i},$ where all secret keys $sk_i$ lie on a polynomial. We show that a wide range of threshold Schnorr signature schemes, including all variants of FROST, Sparkle, and Lindell\u201922, cannot be proven fully adaptively secure without modifications or assuming the hardness of a search problem that we define in this work. We then prove a generalization that extends below t\u22121 adaptive corruptions.",

    "abstract": "This work addresses the problem of Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) Total-Order Broadcast (TOB) in a dynamically available setting, where parties can transition between online and offline states without knowing the number of active parties. Existing dynamically available protocols rely on a synchronous network assumption, which means their latency remains tied to the pessimistic network delay $\\Delta$, even when the actual network delay is $\\delta << \\Delta$. This raises the question of whether a dynamically available BFT TOB protocol can maintain safety and liveness under synchrony while committing blocks at a rate closer to the actual network delay. We answer this question affirmatively by designing the first dynamically available BFT TOB protocol that can commit blocks at the rate of $O(\\Delta_{ideal})$ where $\\Delta_{ideal} < 2\\delta$.",

    "abstract": "We propose a deterministic algorithm based on Coppersmith's method that employs a rank-3 lattice to address factoring-related problems. An interesting aspect of our approach is that we utilize the second vector in the LLL-reduced basis to avoid trivial collisions in the Baby-step Giant-step method, rather than the shortest vector as is commonly used in the literature. Our results are as follows:  \r\n\r\n- Compared to the result by Harvey and Hittmeir (Math. Comp. 91 (2022), 1367\u20131379), who achieved a complexity of  $O\\left( \\frac{N^{1/5} \\log^{16/5} N}{(\\log \\log N)^{3/5}} \\right)$ for factoring a semiprime $N = pq$, we demonstrate that in the balanced $p$ and $q$ case, the complexity can be improved to  $O\\left( \\frac{N^{1/5} \\log^{13/5} N}{(\\log\\log N)^{3/5}} \\right).$\r\n\r\n- For factoring sums and differences of powers, i.e., numbers of the form $N = a^n \\pm b^n$, we improve Hittmeir's result (Math. Comp. 86 (2017), 2947\u20132954) from  $O(N^{1/4} \\log^{3/2} N)$ to  $O\\left( {N^{1/5} \\log^{13/5} N} \\right).$\r\n\r\n- For the problem of finding $r$-power divisors, i.e., finding all integers $p$ such that $p^r \\mid N$, Harvey and Hittmeir (Proceedings of ANTS XV, Res. Number Theory 8 (2022), no.4, Paper No. 94) recently directly applied Coppersmith's method and achieved a complexity of $O\\left(\\frac{N^{1/4r} \\log^{10+\\epsilon} N}{r^3}\\right)$. By using faster LLL-type algorithm and sieving on small primes, we improve their result to $O\\left(\\frac{N^{1/4r} \\log^{7+3\\epsilon} N}{(\\log\\log N-\\log 4r)r^{2+\\epsilon}}\\right)$. The worst case running time for their algorithm occurs when $N = p^r q$ with $q = \\Theta(N^{1/2})$. By focusing on this case and employing our rank-3 lattice approach, we achieve a complexity of  $O\\left(\\sqrt{r} N^{1/4r} \\log^{5/2} N \\right).$\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we offer a new perspective on these problems, which we hope will provide further insights.",

    "abstract": "Avoiding feeding forward seems to be a major goal of the sponge construction. We make a step back and investigate adding feeding forward back to sponge. The obtained sponge-with-feeding-forward construction has a number of benefits: (1) In the random permutation model, its preimage and second preimage security bounds are much better than the standard sponge with the same capacity, while collision and indifferentiability security bounds are comparable; (2) Its collision and (second) preimage security can be reduced to well-defined properties of the underlying permutation, i.e., correlation intractability w.r.t. certain family of evasive relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe further incorporate several somewhat new ideas to form detailed hash and XOF constructions SpongeFwd: (1) Feeding-forward is only applied to the capacity part, and the final output(s) is the capacity part (with the rate part discarded). In this way, when $c$ equals the primary hash output size $h$, a single permutation-call suffices for squeezing. This also simplifies the underlying evasive relations for the reduction security proof. (2) We replace the hash IV with the first message block to have the best possible efficiency. (3) We employ a parallel structure to define an XOF variant. (4) We use HAIFI-style counter inputs to achieve both length-independent second-preimage security and domain separation for XOF.\r\n\r\nThe better (second) preimage security enables constructing 512-bit output hash function from Keccak-p[800]: with 512-bit capacity, its collision and (second) preimage security bounds are the same as the standard SHA-3-512, while its hardware area is reduced by roughly 38% (according to our preliminary estimation).",

    "abstract": "Threshold signatures are one of the most important cryptographic primitives in distributed systems. Of particular interest is the threshold Schnorr signature, a pairing-free signature with efficient verification, compatible with standardized EdDSA (non-threshold) signature. However, most threshold Schnorr signatures have only been proven secure against a static adversary, which has to declare its corruptions before the protocol execution. Many existing adaptively secure constructions require either secure erasures or non-standard assumptions, such as the algebraic group model or hardness of the algebraic one-more discrete logarithm problem. The latest adaptively secure threshold Schnorr signature schemes under standard assumptions require five rounds of communication to create a single signature, limiting its practicality. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we present Gargos, a three-round, adaptively secure threshold Schnorr signature scheme based on the hardness of the decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) problem in the random oracle model (ROM). Our protocol supports full corruption threshold $t < n$, where $t$ is the signing threshold and $n$ is the total number of signers. We achieve our result with an enhanced proof technique that enables us to eliminate two rounds of communication from the recent Glacius scheme (Eurocrypt 2025). We believe our techniques are of independent interest to further research in improving the round complexity of multi-party signing protocols.",

    "abstract": "Forward-secure public key encryption (FS-PKE) is a key-evolving public-key paradigm that ensures the confidentiality of past encryptions even if the secret key is compromised at some later point in time. However, existing FS-PKE schemes are considerably complex and less efficient compared to standard public-key encryption. Updatable public-key encryption (UPKE), introduced by Jost et al. (Eurocrypt 2019), was designed to achieve forward security in secure group messaging while maintaining efficiency. However, existing UPKE constructions either lack post-quantum security or do not support an unbounded number of updates. We focus on isogeny-based cryptosystems due to their suitability for handling an unbounded number of updates in long-term secure messaging. Existing isogeny-based UPKE schemes lack strong security guarantees and formal security proofs. They do not support asynchronous key updates and require sender-receiver coordination.\r\nIn this work, we present two isogeny-based UPKE schemes. The first scheme, UhPKE, extends Moriya et al.\u2019s hash-based public key encryption scheme hPKE to support key updates while the second scheme USimS is an updatable version of Fouotsa et al.\u2019s public key encryption scheme simplified sigamal (SimS). The scheme UhPKE relies on the commutative supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman(CSSIDH) assumption and achieves indistinguishability under chosen randomness and chosen plaintext attack (IND-CR-CPA). The scheme USimS derives its security under the hardness of the CSSIDH problem and the commutative supersingular isogeny knowledge of exponent (CSSIKoE) problem. It is the first isogeny-based UPKE scheme that exhibits indistinguishability under chosen randomness and chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CR-CCA). The security of UhPKE and USimS is established by proving that their underlying schemes, hPKE and SimS are circular secure and leakage resilient (CS + LR). We emphasized that our constructions support an unlimited number of key updates while retaining the efficiency of their underlying public key encryption schemes. Besides, proposed UPKEs enable asynchronous key updates, allowing senders to update the public key independently. More affirmatively, UhPKE and USimS offer improved storage, computation and communication efficiency compared to existing UPKE schemes. \r\nFurthermore, we extend and refine the security notion of the updatable key encapsulation mechanism (UKEM) introduced by Haidar et al. (Asiacrypt 2023)from the bounded number of updates to the unbounded number of updates. We present the first post-quantum secure UKEM that does not rely on zero-knowledge proofs. More precisely, we introduce two UKEM schemes which are the first of their kind in the isogeny setting. Our first scheme, UKEM1, is derived from our UhPKE and achieves IND-CR-CPA security. Our second construction, UKEM2, is based on our USimS scheme and achieves IND-CR-CCA security. We provide security for our UKEMs in our proposed enhanced security framework that supports an unbounded number of key updates. More positively, our UKEMs not only support unlimited key updates but also enable independent encapsulation and decapsulation key updates without requiring sender-receiver synchronization similar to our UPKEs. Both UKEM1 and UKEM2 exhibit compact storage and communication costs with minimal size ciphertexts while their computational efficiency differs in decapsulation and key updates where UKEM2 incurs an additional discrete logarithm computation in the decapsulation phase, but potentially offering stronger IND-CR-CCA security in contrast to UKEM1 which is IND-CR-CPA secure.",

    "abstract": "Parallel Byzantine broadcast (PBC) (also known as Interactive Consistency), is a fundamental problem in distributed computing and cryptography which asks that all parties reliably distribute a message to all other parties. We give the first communication-efficient protocol for PBC in the model with plain public keys (i.e., no trusted dealer) which achieves security against an adaptive adversary that can corrupt up to $t<n/2$ parties. \r\n\r\nOur protocol runs in total communication complexity $O(n^2\\ell\\log(n)+n\\kappa^2\\log^4(n))$ bits to succeed with probability $1-2^{-\\kappa}$, where $\\ell$ is the length of a message. All prior protocols either rely on a trusted setup or require at least $O(n^3)$ communication complexity. As a stepping stone, we present a binary consensus protocol with the same resilience and success probability that sends $O(n^2\\kappa\\log(n)+n\\kappa^2\\log^3(n))$ bits. \r\n\r\nWe achieve these results based on a highly efficient gossip procedure that implements echo operations at low cost, and might prove useful in deriving further efficient protocols relying on simple cryptographic tools.",

    "abstract": "Secure Multi-Party Computation is a privacy-enhancing technology that allows several parties to securely compute on distributed private data.  \r\nIn the line of the well established SPDZ protocol,  the by far most expensive task is the generation of Beaver triples in the so called  offline phase.\r\nSilentium is our implementation of an actively secure offline phase in the form of a Pseudorandom Correlation Generator for Beaver triples (Bt-PCG, Boyle et al. CRYPTO 2020), which, as any PCG, is designed to have low communication. Compared to previous offline phases, their Bt-PCG reduces the communication costs by three orders of magnitude. However, so far efficiency was only estimated. With Silentium, we  demonstrate that their Bt-PCG can achieve even better running times than state-of-the-art offline phase implementations in the  MP-SPDZ library. To actually achieve such a performance, Silentium  comprises a systematic   parallelization strategy and implementation-friendly decomposition scenarios of the Bt-PCG into structured modules. \r\nLooking forward for large-scale applications on the cloud,  Silentium is designed to be versatile to support hardware acceleration in future.",

    "abstract": "Secret sharing (SS) is a foundational cryptographic primitive with diverse applications, including secure multiparty computation and conditional disclosure of secrets. While traditional schemes have primarily emphasized information-theoretic security, recent advancements have increasingly leveraged computational assumptions to achieve more efficient constructions and support broader access policies. Despite these successes, most existing computational secret sharing (CSS) schemes are limited to a static security model, where adversaries must commit to their choice of corrupted participants at the outset. A critical challenge in CSS lies in achieving adaptive security, where adversaries can dynamically select participants to corrupt, better reflecting real-world threat models.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present a novel transformation that converts any statically secure CSS scheme into an adaptively secure one while preserving the original access policy and computational assumptions, providing a framework for bridging the gap between static and adaptive security. Our construction introduces a multiplicative share size overhead of $O(n^2)$ where $n$ is the number of parties. Additionally, we explore trade-offs in efficiency and security, offering more efficient adaptive CSS constructions for specific, restricted policy classes. This work addresses key limitations in the current landscape of CSS and paves the way for broader adoption of adaptively secure secret sharing in cryptographic applications.",

    "abstract": "The leader election problem requires a set of $n$ parties, out of which up to $t$ can be Byzantine, to elect a leader uniformly at random such that no two parties disagree on the elected leader and an honest leader is elected with constant probability. The Scalable Leader Election protocol published in SODA'2006 is an important breakthrough in solving this problem efficiently for all but $o(1)$ of the parties. They achieve a protocol for $t < (\\frac{1}{3} - \\epsilon)n$ (for $\\epsilon = o(1)$) in the full-information setting such that every party only sends polylog \\(n\\) bits. \r\n    \r\n    In this paper, we revisit their work and show that there are subtleties in the protocol that are not dealt with in the analysis. In particular, two mechanisms related to ``silencing'' parties and dealing with ``bad nodes'' are at odds with each other, which is why the existing analysis is insufficient. We present these concerns in detail and subsequently present a modification to their protocol with a corresponding analysis to solve leader election with the desired metrics.",

    "abstract": "Given two linear codes, the Code Equivalence Problem asks to find (if it exists) an isometry between them. A special case is the Permutation Equivalence Problem (PEP), where the isometry is a permutation. The hardness of PEP is crucially dependent on the hull of a code, that is, the intersection between a code and its dual. For random codes, with large probability the hull is trivial, i.e., has dimension $h = 0$: this allows for efficient attacks. However, when the hull is large enough, all known attacks take exponential time and PEP is deemed hard.\r\n\r\nIn this paper we study how the so-called Schur product between linear codes can be employed to solve PEP. The main idea is to transform a given PEP instance by computing powers of the given codes. We show that, while squaring a pair of equivalent codes preserves the equivalence, the new pair of codes have trivial hull with high probability. This allows to identify many new weak instances of PEP, namely: whenever $h<\\sqrt{2n}$ With some technical caveats, our solver runs in average polynomial time.\r\n\r\nAs a concrete application, we consider the updatable encryption scheme proposed by Albrecht, Ben\u010dina and Lai at Eurocrypt 2025. All the recommended instances fall into the range of weak PEP instances we identify in this paper, hence are susceptible to our attack. We successfully recover the secret permutation for one of the instances claiming 128 bits of security. As a fix, instances with hull dimension $h>\\sqrt{2n}$ shall be employed.",

    "abstract": "As quantum technology advances, developing cryptographic solutions resistant to quantum attacks is crucial. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) provides a practical approach by running on classical computers. They rely on hard mathematical problems, with lattice-based being one of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-recognized schemes known for its small key sizes. Hardware implementation of these schemes faces challenges due to the computational intensity of operations like polynomial multiplication, especially for resource-constrained devices. This paper proposes a novel Modular Tiled Toeplitz Matrix-Vector Polynomial Multiplication (MT-TMVP) for lattice-based PQC algorithms and presents a resource-optimized Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) architecture. The proposed implementation significantly reduces resource utilization and Area-Delay Product (ADP) compared to state-of-the-art polynomial multipliers. It utilizes 99.68% and 84.22% fewer Look-Up Tables (LUTs) on Artix-7 and Zynq Ultrascale+ FPGAs, respectively, and achieves 99.94% and 80.02% ADP improvements on these FPGAs compared to the best results in the literature. By leveraging Block RAM (BRAM), the proposed architecture offers robustness against timing-based Side-Channel Attacks (SCAs), and the design is modular and scalable to any polynomial degree.",

    "abstract": "In a world where financial transactions are primarily performed or recorded online, protecting sensitive transaction details has become crucial. Roommates sharing housing costs or friends splitting travelling expenses may use applications such as Splitwise to easily track debts and minimize the number of individual repayments. However, these apps reveal potentially sensitive financial transaction activity to their operators. In this paper, we present Silent Splitter, a privacy-preserving payment splitting system which enables users to securely set up groups, perform transactions within those groups, and \"settle up\" without revealing group membership or any sensitive transaction details (such as the users involved or amount of money exchanged) to the system itself. Silent Splitter operates in the two server setting and uses Distributed Point Functions (DPFs) to securely record transactions. Of independent interest, we also present new protocols for proving knowledge of properties of DPFs as part of our system.",

    "abstract": "Pseudorandom codes (PRCs) are error-correcting codes with the distinguishing feature that their codewords are computationally indistinguishable from random strings. Introduced by Christ and Gunn (CRYPTO 2024), PRCs have found applications in areas such as AI watermarking, where both robustness and pseudorandomness are essential. All known constructions of PRCs rely on coding-theoretic hardness assumptions. In this work, we study how inherent the use of coding-theoretic hardness is in the construction of pseudorandom codes. \r\n\r\nWe show that there is no black-box construction of PRCs with binary alphabets capable of decoding from a constant fraction of Bernoulli noise from a class of oracles we call local oracles. The class of local oracles includes random oracles and trapdoor permutation oracles, and can be interpreted as a meaningful notion of oracles that are not resilient against noise. Our separation result is cast in the Impagliazzo-Rudich framework and crucially relies on the Bonami-Beckner hypercontractivity theorem on the Boolean hypercube.\r\n\r\nAs a complementary result, we show that PRCs with large alphabets that can tolerate high error rates can indeed be constructed in a black-box manner from one-way functions.",

    "abstract": "A pseudorandom code is a keyed error-correction scheme with the property that any polynomial number of encodings appear random to any computationally bounded adversary. We show that the pseudorandomness of any code tolerating a constant rate of random errors cannot be based on black-box reductions to almost any generic cryptographic primitive: for instance, anything that can be built from random oracles, generic multilinear groups, and virtual black-box obfuscation. Our result is optimal, as Ghentiyala and Guruswami (2024) observed that pseudorandom codes tolerating any sub-constant rate of random errors exist using a black-box reduction from one-way functions.\r\n\r\nThe key technical ingredient in our proof is the hypercontractivity theorem for Boolean functions, which we use to prove our impossibility in the random oracle model. It turns out that this easily extends to an impossibility in the presence of \"crypto oracles,\" a notion recently introduced---and shown to be capable of implementing all the primitives mentioned above---by Lin, Mook, and Wichs (EUROCRYPT 2025).",

    "abstract": "Secure and trustworthy electronic voting requires more than correctness and censorship resistance, it must also ensure voter privacy, vote confidentiality, and protection against coercion. Prior work attempt to address these challenges using heavyweight cryptographic primitives such as homomorphic encryption, time-lock puzzles, or multi-party computation. These approaches often involve complex computations, depend on trusted parties, and typically do not scale well. We propose a lightweight, fully on-chain anonymous voting protocol based on a novel application of the proof-of-burn (PoB) mechanism. Voters anonymously commit to their votes by burning tokens to pseudorandom addresses and later submit zero-knowledge proofs attesting to their valid participation. Our design achieves vote integrity, coercion resistance, and unlinkability without relying on encrypted ballots, trusted third parties, or centralized tallying. The tallying process is public and operates on plaintext votes that are authenticated yet unlinkable to voters. This enables flexible voting models\u2014including token-weighted and quadratic voting\u2014with minimal on-chain overhead. We formally analyze the protocol\u2019s security guarantees and demonstrate support for a broad range of voting models. We implement the protocol as an open-source library fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and our experimental evaluation confirms its high scalability and improved efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "Payment Channel Networks (PCNs) enhance blockchain scalability by enabling off-chain transactions. However, repeated unidirectional multi-hop payments often cause channel imbalance or depletion, limiting scalability and usability. Existing rebalancing protocols, such as Horcrux [NDSS\u201925] and Shaduf [NDSS\u201922], rely on on-chain operations, which hinders efficiency and broad applicability.\r\n  We propose Universal Channel Rebalancing (UCRb), a blockchain-agnostic, fully off-chain framework that ensures correct behavior among untrusted participants without on-chain interaction. \r\n  UCRb incorporates the following core innovations: \r\n  (1) a fair and reliable incentive-compatible mechanism that encourages voluntary user participation in off-chain channel rebalancing,  \r\n  (2) integration of Pedersen commitments to achieve atomic off-chain payments and rebalancing operations, while ensuring balance security, and  \r\n  (3) zero-knowledge proofs to enable privacy-preserving channel initialization and coin shifting, ensuring that user identities and fund allocations remain hidden throughout the process.\r\n\r\n  We evaluate UCRb using real-world Lightning Network dataset and compare its performance against state-of-the-art solutions including Horcrux, Shaduf, and Revive [CCS'17]. \r\n  UCRb exhibits a success ratio enhancement between 15% and 50%, while also reducing the required user deposits by 72%--92%. It maintains an almost negligible rate of channel depletion. Additionally, the long-term performance of UCRb is roughly 1.5 times that of its short-term performance, suggesting that continuous operation leads to improved efficiency. We implement a prototype for UCRb smart contracts and demonstrate its practicality through extensive evaluation. As \\texttt{CoinShift} operations require no on-chain interaction, the protocol incurs minimal gas costs. For instance, opening and closing channels with 10 neighbors costs only 130K-160K gas\u2014significantly lower than comparable solutions.",

    "abstract": "As generative models continue to evolve, verifying the authenticity, provenance, and integrity of digital media has become increasingly critical\u2014particularly for domains like journalism, digital art, and scientific documentation.\r\nIn this work, we present a decentralized verifiable media ecosystem for managing, verifying, and transacting authentic digital media using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).\r\nBuilding on VIMz (Dziembowski et al., PETS'25), we extend the framework in three key directions. First, we generalize the model to support arbitrary image regions to achieve selective transformations support such as redaction and regional blurring\u2014features commonly required in privacy-preserving applications. Second, we introduce performance optimizations that yield up to an 18% improvement in off-chain proof generation, and enhance the framework to support cost-efficient on-chain verification. Third, we design and implement a modular smart contract architecture to support a wide range of decentralized media applications.\r\nAs a flagship use case, we develop a decentralized media marketplace that enables permissionless licensing, ownership transfer, and verifiable attribution. In this setting, users can share transformed media\u2014such as cropped, blurred, or resized previews\u2014alongside ZKPs that prove derivation from a signed original, eliminating the need to trust the seller.\r\nUnlike prior fair exchange protocols, which rely on trusted descriptions or encrypted payload delivery, our system enables verifiable public previews and origin-bound proofs without revealing the full content. This approach unlocks new applications beyond marketplaces, including automated infringement dispute resolution and photography contests with verifiable criteria.",

    "abstract": "Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) trains machine learning (ML) models with formal privacy guarantees for the training set by adding random noise to gradient updates. In collaborative learning (CL), where multiple parties jointly train a model, noise addition occurs either (i) before or (ii) during secure gradient aggregation. The first option is deployed in distributed DP methods, which require greater amounts of total noise to achieve security, resulting in degraded model utility. The second approach preserves model utility but requires a secure multiparty computation (MPC) protocol. Existing methods for MPC noise generation require tens to hundreds of seconds of runtime per noise sample because of the number of parties involved. This makes them impractical for collaborative learning, which often requires thousands or more samples of noise in each training step.\r\n\r\nWe present a novel protocol for MPC noise sampling tailored to the collaborative learning setting. It works by constructing an approximation of the distribution of interest which can be efficiently sampled by a series of table lookups. Our method achieves significant runtime improvements and requires much less communication compared to previous work, especially at higher numbers of parties. It is also highly flexible \u2013 while previous MPC sampling methods tend to be optimized for specific distributions, we prove that our method can generically sample\r\nnoise from statistically close approximations of arbitrary discrete distributions. This makes it compatible with a wide variety of DP mechanisms. Our experiments demonstrate the efficiency and utility of our method applied to a discrete Gaussian mechanism for differentially private collaborative learning. For 16 parties, we achieve a runtime of 0.06 seconds and 11.59 MB total communication per sample, a 230\u00d7 runtime improvement and 3\u00d7 less communication compared to the prior state-of-the-art for sampling from discrete Gaussian distribution in MPC.",

    "abstract": "Collaborative zk-SNARKs (Ozdemir and Boneh, USENIX\u201922) are a multiparty variant of zk-SNARKs where multiple, mutually distrustful provers, each holding a private input, jointly compute a zk-SNARK using their combined inputs. A sequence of works has proposed efficient constructions of collaborative zk-SNARKs using a common template that involves designing secure multiparty computation (MPC) protocols to emulate a zk-SNARK prover without making non-black-box use of cryptography. To achieve security against malicious adversaries, these works adopt compilers from the MPC literature that transform semi-honest MPC into malicious-secure MPC.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we revisit this design template.\r\n\u2022 Pitfalls: We demonstrate two pitfalls in the template, which can lead to a loss of input privacy. We first show that it is possible to compute collaborative proofs on invalid witnesses, which in turn can leak the inputs of honest provers. Next, we show that using state-of-the-art malicious security compilers as-is for proof computation is insecure, in general. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies.\r\n\u2022 Malicious Security Essentially for Free: As our main technical result, we show that in the honest-majority setting, one can forego malicious security checks performed by state-of-the-art malicious security compilers during collaborative proof generation of several widely used zk-SNARKs. In other words, we can avoid the overheads of malicious security compilers, enabling faster proof generation.\r\n\r\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of non-trivial computations where semi-honest MPC protocols achieve malicious security. The observations underlying our positive results are general and may have applications beyond collaborative zkSNARKs.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we show that parallel repetition of public-coin interactive arguments reduces the soundness error at an exponential rate even in the post-quantum setting. Moreover, we generalize this result to hold for threshold verifiers, where the parallel repeated verifier accepts if and only if at least $t$ of the executions are accepted (for some threshold $t$). Prior to this work, these results were known only when the cheating prover was assumed to be classical.\r\n\r\nWe also prove a similar result for three-message private-coin arguments.  Previously, Bostanci, Qian, Spooner, and Yuen (STOC 2024) proved such a parallel repetition result in the more general setting of quantum protocols, where the verifier and communication may be quantum. We consider only protocols where the verifier is classical, but obtain a simplified analysis, and for the more general setting of threshold verifiers.",

    "abstract": "End-to-end encryption allows data to be outsourced and stored on an untrusted server, such as in the cloud, without compromising data privacy. In the setting when this data is shared between a group of users, members also all share access to the same static key material used for data encryption. When the group membership changes, access control is only enforced by the server: security breaches or compelled disclosure would allow even a removed member to decrypt the current shared data.\r\n\r\nWe propose to move away from static keys and instead use a group key progression (GKP) scheme, a novel primitive that enables a dynamic group of users to agree on a persistent sequence of keys while keeping a compact local state. GKP ensures that group members can only derive keys within a certain interval of the sequence, a notion that we call interval access control (IAC), and also provide post-compromise security. Our GKP construction, called Grappa, combines continuous group key agreement (CGKA, by Alwen et al., 2020) with a new abstraction called interval scheme. The latter is a symmetric-key primitive that can derive a sequence of keys from a compact state while preserving IAC. We explore different interval scheme constructions and simulate their storage and communication costs when used in group settings. The most efficient of them is a generalization of dual key regression (Shafagh et al., 2020), which we formalize and prove secure. Overall, our protocols offer a practical and robust solution to protect persistent data shared by a group.",

    "abstract": "Ascon, a family of algorithms that support hashing and Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD), is the final winner of the NIST Lightweight Cryptography Project.\r\nAs a research hotspot, Ascon has received substantial third-party security evaluation. Among all the results of Ascon-128 (the primary recommendation of AEAD), the key recovery attack can only be achieved by reducing the initialization phase to 7 rounds or fewer, regardless of whether it violates the security claims made by the designers (i.e., misuse of the nonce or exceeding data limits $2^{64}$). \r\nIn this paper, we, from two aspects (misuse-free setting and misused setting), improve the key recovery attack on Ascon-128 using the cube attack method.\r\nIn one part, we present a faster method to recover the superpolies for a 64-dimensional cube in the output bits of the 7-round initialization, enabling us to recover the secret key with a time complexity of $2^{95.96}$ and a data complexity of $2^{64}$.\r\nOur 7-round key recovery attack, based on the full key space, greatly improves the time complexity, making it the best result to date.\r\nAdditionally, we utilize several techniques to extend state recovery to key recovery, answering the open problem of transitioning from full state recovery in the encryption phase to key recovery for Ascon-128 (ToSc Vol 4, 2022). By combining encryption phase state recovery with initialization phase key recovery, we can achieve 8-round and 9-round initialization phase key recovery in the nonce misuse scenario, with time complexities of $2^{101}$ and $2^{123.92}$, respectively.\r\nThis represents an improvement of two rounds over previous results in the misused setting.\r\nOur first key recovery attack is also applicable to Ascon-128a, achieving \r\n the same result. In cases where the full state, prior to the encryption phase, can be recovered in other Ascon AEAD modes, our second key recovery attack will also be useful. It is worth noting that this work does not threaten the security of the full 12 rounds Ascon, but we expect that our results provide new insights\r\ninto the security of Ascon.",

    "abstract": "Anonymous rate-limited tokens are a special type of credential that can be used to improve the efficiency of privacy-preserving authentication systems like Privacy Pass. In such a scheme, a user obtains a \"token dispenser\" by interacting with an issuer, and the dispenser allows the user to create up to a pre-determined number $k$ of unlinkable and publicly verifiable tokens. Unlinkable means that one should not be able to tell that two tokens originate from the same dispenser, but also they cannot be linked to the interaction that generated the dispenser. Furthermore, we can limit the rate at which these tokens are created by linking each token to a context (e.g., the service we are authenticating to), and imposing a limit $N \\leq k$ such that seeing more than $N$ tokens for the same context will reveal the identity of the user.\r\nConstructions of such tokens were first given by Camenisch, Hohenberger and Lysyanskaya (EUROCRYPT '05) and Camenisch, Hohenberger, Kohlweiss, Lysyanskaya, and Meyerovich (CCS '06). \r\n\r\nIn this work, we present the first construction of \\emph{everlasting} anonymous rate-limited tokens, for which unlinkability holds against computationally unbounded adversaries, whereas other security properties (e.g., unforgeability) remain computational. Our construction relies on pairings. While several parameters in our construction unavoidably grow with $k$, the key challenge we resolve is ensuring that the complexity of dispensing a token is independent of the parameter $k$. \r\n\r\nWe are motivated here by the goal of providing solutions that are robust to potential future quantum attacks against the anonymity of previously stored tokens. A construction based on post-quantum secure assumptions (e.g., based on lattices) would be rather inefficient---instead, we take a pragmatic approach dispensing with post-quantum security for properties not related to privacy.",

    "abstract": "\\gift, including \\gift-64 and \\gift-128, is a family of lightweight block ciphers with outstanding implementation performance and high security, which is a popular underlying primitive chosen by many AEADs such as \\sundae.  Currently, differential cryptanalysis is the best key-recovery attack on both ciphers, but they have stuck at 21 and 27 rounds for \\gift-64 and \\gift-128, respectively. Recently, Beyne and Rijmen proposed the quasidifferential transition matrix for differential cryptanalysis at CRYPTO 2022 and showed that the fixed-key probability of a differential (characteristic) can be expressed as the sum of correlations of all quasidifferential trails corresponding to this differential (characteristic). As pointed out by Beyne and Rijmen in their paper, the quasidifferential methodology is useful in identifying weak-key differential attacks.\r\n    In this paper, we apply Beyne and Rijmen's method to \\gift. Some differential characteristics with small (average) probabilities can have much larger probabilities when weak-key conditions hold. Improved weak-key differential attacks on \\gift-64 and \\gift-128 are thus obtained. For \\gift-64, the probability of a 13-round differential is improved from $2^{-62.06}$ to $2^{-57.82}$ with 4 bits of weak-key conditions, then an improved differential key-recovery attack on 21-round \\gift-64 is obtained with $2^{117.42}/2^{64}$ time/data complexities; the probability of a 13-round multiple differential (containing 33 characteristics) is improved from $2^{-58.96}$ to $2^{-55.67}$ with 4 bits of weak-key conditions, then an improved multiple differential key-recovery attack on 21-round \\gift-64 is obtained with $2^{123.27}/2^{64}$ time/data complexities. For \\gift-128, the probability of a 20-round differential is improved from $2^{-121.83}$ to $2^{-114.77}$ with 6 bits of weak-key conditions; the probability of a 21-round multiple differential (containing 2 differentials) is improved from $2^{-128.38}$ to $2^{-122.77}$ with 4 bits of weak-key conditions. Improved (multiple) differential weak-key key-recovery attacks are obtained for 27 and 28 rounds of \\gift-128 with $2^{115.77}$/$2^{115.77}$ and $2^{123.77}$/$2^{123.77}$ time/data complexities, respectively. As far as we know, this is the first time that a (weak-key)  key-recovery attack can reach 28 rounds of \\gift-128.\r\n    Additionally, as an independent interest, we perform the first differential attack on \\sundae. The differential used in this attack is checked with quasidifferential trails, thus the probability is reliable. Our attack is nonce-respecting and has significantly better complexities than the currently best attack.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we consider secure multiparty computation (MPC) in the asynchronous network setting. MPC allows $n$ parties to compute a public function on their private inputs against an adversary corrupting at most $t$ of them. We consider both communication complexity and round complexity of asynchronous MPC (AMPC) with the optimal resilience $n=3t+1$. \r\n\r\n    Without fully homomorphic encryptions, the best-known result in this setting is achieved by Coretti, Garay, Hirt, and Zikas (ASIACRYPT 2016), which requires $O(|C|n^3\\kappa)$ bits of communication assuming one-way functions, where $\\kappa$ is the security parameter. On the other hand, the best-known non-constant-round AMPC by Goyal, Liu, and Song (CRYPTO 2024) can achieve $O(|C|n)$ communication even in the information-theoretic setting. In this work, we give the first construction of a constant-round AMPC with $O(|C|n\\kappa)$ bits of communication that achieves malicious security with abort assuming random oracles. We provide new techniques for adapting the MPC-in-the-head framework in the asynchronous network to compute a constant-size garbled circuit.",

    "abstract": "Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) Consensus protocols with trusted hardware assistance have been extensively explored for their improved resilience to tolerate more faulty processes. Nonetheless, the potential of trust hardware has been scarcely investigated in leaderless BFT protocols. RedBelly is assumed to be the first blockchain network whose consensus is based on a truly leaderless BFT algorithm. This paper proposes a trusted hardware-assisted leaderless BFT consensus protocol by offering a hybrid solution for the set BFT problem defined in the RedBelly blockchain. Drawing on previous studies, we present two crucial trusted services: the counter and the collector. Based on these two services, we introduce two primitives to formulate our leaderless BFT protocol: a hybrid verified broadcast (VRB) protocol and a hybrid binary agreement. The hybrid VRB protocol enhances the hybrid reliable broadcast protocol by integrating a verification function. This addition ensures that a broadcast message is verified not only for authentication but also for the correctness of its content. Our hybrid BFT consensus is integrated with these broadcast protocols to deliver binary decisions on all proposals. We prove the correctness of the proposed hybrid protocol and demonstrate its enhanced performance in comparison to the prior trusted BFT protocol.",

    "abstract": "Asynchronous common subset (ACS) has been extensively studied since the asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) framework was introduced by Ben-Or, Kemler, and Rabin (BKR). \r\nThe line of work (i.e., HoneyBadgerBFT, BEAT, EPIC) uses parallel reliable broadcast (RBC) and asynchronous binary agreement (ABA) instances to reach an agreement on a subset of proposed transactions. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we further progress the BKR paradigm by presenting Janus, the first hybrid ACS protocol leveraging trusted hardware components.\r\nJanus is the first ACS protocol that tolerates a minority of Byzantine processes and that has O(n^2) message complexity.\r\nSupported by trusted hardware components, we introduce a provable broadcast primitive to replace RBC, and develop a resilient binary agreement protocol. Messages for concurrent instances of agreement are aggregated into vectors. Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over predominant ACS constructions with a 92%+ increase compared to HoneyBadgerBFT and a 47%+ increase compared to BEAT.\r\nAdditionally, we provide a comparison with open-source hybrid BFT protocols that operate under a partially synchronous network, highlighting the performance enhancement compared to previous hybrid protocols that also tolerate the Byzantine minority (e.g., MinBFT and Damysus, by 49%+).",

    "abstract": "Continuous Group Key Agreement (CGKA) is the primitive underlying secure group messaging.\r\nIt allows a large group of $N$ users to maintain a shared secret key that is frequently rotated by the group members in order to achieve forward secrecy and post compromise security.\r\nThe group messaging scheme Messaging Layer Security (MLS) standardized by the IETF makes use of a CGKA called TreeKEM which arranges the $N$ group members in a binary tree.\r\nHere, each node is associated with a public-key,\r\neach user is assigned one of the leaves,\r\nand a user knows the corresponding secret keys from their leaf to the root.\r\nTo update the key material known to them, a user must just replace keys at $\\log(N)$ nodes, which requires them to create and upload $\\log(N)$ ciphertexts. Such updates must be processed sequentially by all users, which for large groups is impractical.\r\nTo allow for concurrent updates, TreeKEM uses the ``propose and commit'' paradigm, where multiple users can concurrently propose to update (by just sampling a fresh leaf key), and a single user can then commit to all proposals at once.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this process destroys the binary tree structure as the tree gets pruned and some nodes must be ``blanked'' at the cost of increasing the in-degree of others, which makes the commit operation, as well as, future commits more costly.\r\nIn the worst case, the update cost (in terms of uploaded ciphertexts) per user can grow from $\\log(N)$ to $\\Omega(N)$.\r\n\r\nIn this work we provide two main contributions.\r\nFirst, we show that MLS' communication complexity is bad not only in the worst case but also if the proposers and committers are chosen at random:\r\neven if there's just one update proposal for every commit the expected cost is already over $\\sqrt{N}$, and it approaches $N$ as this ratio changes towards more proposals.\r\n\r\nOur second contribution is a new variant of propose and commit for TreeKEM which for moderate amounts of update proposals per commit provably achieves an update cost of $\\Theta(\\log(N))$ assuming the proposers and committers are chosen at random.",

    "abstract": "Homomorphic encryption schemes based on the Ring-Learning-with-Errors problem require accurate ciphertext noise analysis to ensure correctness and security. However, ring multiplications during homomorphic computations make the noise in the result ciphertexts difficult to characterize. Existing average-case noise analyses derive a bound on the noise by either assuming it follows a Gaussian distribution, or giving empirical formulae, with strong independence assumption and the Central Limit Theorem extensively applied. In this work, we question the validity of these methods, by showing that the noise exhibits a heavy-tailed distribution via exact calculation of its variance and kurtosis, for both independent and dependent noises. The heavy-tailedness suggests the failing probability of bounds derived from these methods may not be negligible, and we experimentally demonstrate several cases where the noise growth is underestimated.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the notion of committed vector oblivious linear evaluation (C-VOLE), which allows a party holding a pre-committed vector to generate VOLE correlations with multiple parties on the committed value. It is a unifying tool that can be found useful in zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) of committed values, actively secure multi-party computation, private set intersection (PSI), etc.\r\n\r\nTo achieve the best efficiency, we design a tailored commitment scheme and matching C-VOLE protocols, both based on the learning parity with noise assumption. In particular, exploiting the structures of the carefully designed LPN-based commitment minimizes the cost of ensuring consistency between the committed vector and VOLE correlation. As a result, we achieve a 28$\\times$ improvement over the protocol proposed in prior work (Usenix 2021) that uses ZKP to prove the correct opening of the commitment. We also apply C-VOLE to design a PSI protocol that allows one server to run PSI repeatedly with multiple clients while ensuring that the same set is used across all executions. Compared with the state-of-the-art PSI (CCS 2024) with similar security requirements, our protocol reduces the communication overhead by a factor of 35$\\times$.",

    "abstract": "Many distributed analytics applications that are offloaded to the cloud operate on sensitive data. Even when the computations for such analytics workloads are confined to trusted hardware enclaves and all stored data and network communications are encrypted, several studies have shown that they are still vulnerable to access pattern attacks. Prior efforts towards preventing access pattern leakage often incur network and compute overheads that are logarithmic in dataset size, while also limiting the functionality of supported analytics jobs.\r\n\r\nWe present Weave, an efficient, expressive, and secure analytics platform that scales to large datasets.  Weaveemploys a combination of noise injection and hardware memory isolation via enclave page caches to reduce the network and compute overheads for oblivious analytics to a constant factor. Weave also employs several optimizations and extensions that exploit dataset and workload-specific properties to ensure performance at scale without compromising on functionality. Our evaluations show that Weave reduces the end-to-end execution time for a wide range of analytics jobs on large real-world datasets by $4$--$10\\times$ compared to prior state-of-the-art while providing strong obliviousness guarantees.",

    "abstract": "Distributed Randomness Beacons (DRBs) provide secure, unbiased random numbers for decentralized systems. However, existing protocols face critical limitations. Most rely on cryptographic assumptions which are vulnerable to quantum attacks, risking long-term security in asynchronous networks where unbounded delays may allow attackers time to exploit these weaknesses. Many achieve low beacon generation rates, often below 100 beacons per minute in moderate-scale networks (e.g., Spurt IEEE S&P\u201922), hindering their use in applications requiring high-throughput randomness. Additionally, traditional Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS)-based DRBs, using a share-consensus-reconstruct paradigm, are unsuitable for asynchronous networks due to circular dependencies between beacon generation and consensus. Given these limitations, we propose Rubato, the first provably post-quantum secure DRB for asynchronous environments, incorporating a lattice-based batched Asynchronous Verifiable Secret Sharing scheme (bAVSS-PQ). Rubato supports batching of $\\mathcal{O}(\\lambda^2)$ secrets with communication complexity $\\mathcal{O}(\\lambda n^3 \\log n)$ and tolerates Byzantine faults in up to one-third of the nodes. Integrated with DAG-based consensus protocols like Bullshark or Tusk, its epoch-staggered architecture resolves circular dependencies, enabling efficient and secure randomness generation. Evaluations across 10 to 50 nodes show Rubato generates 5200 to 350 beacons per minute with per-beacon latencies of 11.60 to 96.37 milliseconds, achieving a consensus throughput of 186,088 transactions per second with a latency of 16.78 seconds at 30 nodes. Rubato offers robust post-quantum security and high performance for small-to-medium-scale decentralized systems.",

    "abstract": "The Rowhammer attack is a fault-injection technique leveraging the density of RAM modules to trigger persistent hardware bit flips that can be used for probing or modifying protected data. In this paper, we show that Falcon, the hash-and-sign signature scheme over NTRU lattices selected by NIST for standardization, is vulnerable to an attack using Rowhammer.\r\n\r\nFalcon's Gaussian sampler is the core component of its security, as it allows to provably decorrelate the short basis used for signing and the generated signatures. Other schemes, lacking this guarantee (such as NTRUSign, GGH or more recently Peregrine) were proven insecure. However, performing efficient and secure lattice Gaussian sampling has proved to be a difficult task, fraught with numerous potential vulnerabilities to be exploited. To avoid timing attacks, a common technique is to use distribution tables that are traversed to output a sample. The official Falcon implementation uses this technique, employing a hardcoded reverse cumulative distribution table (RCDT). Using Rowhammer, we target Falcon's RCDT to trigger a very small number of targeted bit flips, and prove that the resulting distribution is sufficiently skewed to perform a key recovery attack.\r\n\r\nNamely, we show that a single targeted bit flip suffices to fully recover the signing key, given a few hundred million signatures, with more bit flips enabling key recovery with fewer signatures. Interestingly, the Nguyen\u2013Regev parallelepiped learning attack that broke NTRUSign, GGH and Peregrine does not readily adapt to this setting unless the number of bit flips is very large. However, we show that combining it with principal component analysis (PCA) yields a practical attack.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability can also be triggered with other types of persistent fault attacks on memory like optical faults. We suggest cheap countermeasures that largely mitigate it, including rejecting signatures that are unusually short.",

    "abstract": "Anamorphic signatures allow covert communication through signatures in environments where encryption is restricted. They enable trusted recipients with a double key to extract hidden messages while the signature remains indistinguishable from a fresh and regular one. However, the traditional notion of anamorphic signatures suffers from vulnerabilities, particularly when a single recipient or sender is compromised, exposing all hidden messages and providing undeniable proof that citizens are part of the anamorphic exchange.\r\n\r\nTo address these limitations, we explore a threshold-based approach to distribute trust among multiple recipients, preventing adversaries from decrypting anamorphic messages even if some recipients are compromised. Our first contribution is the formalization of the notion of \\emph{threshold-recipient anamorphic signatures}, where decryption is possible only through collaboration among a subset of recipients. \r\n\r\nWe then explore a \\emph{stronger model} where the dictator controls the key generation process through which it learns all secret keys and how citizens store cryptographic keys. A particular example of this model in the real world is a dictator providing citizens with electronic identity documents (eIDs) and blocking all other usage of cryptography. We demonstrate that anamorphic communication is still possible even in such a scenario. Our construction is secure against post-quantum adversaries and does not rely on any computational assumptions except the random oracle model.\r\n\r\nFinally, we show an \\emph{impossibility result} for encoding anamorphic messages with a threshold-sender model when using many existing threshold signature schemes and the adversary is part of the signing group. Our work outlines both the possibilities and limitations of extending anamorphic signatures with threshold cryptography, offering new insights into improving the security and privacy of individuals under authoritarian regimes.",

    "abstract": "CVRFs are PRFs that unify the properties of verifiable and constrained PRFs. Since they were introduced concurrently by Fuchsbauer and Chandran-Raghuraman-Vinayagamurthy in 2014, it has been an open problem to construct CVRFs without using heavy machinery such as multilinear maps, obfuscation or functional encryption.\r\n\r\nWe solve this problem by constructing a prefix-constrained verifiable PRF that does not rely on the aforementioned assumptions. Essentially, our construction is a verifiable version of the Goldreich-Goldwasser-Micali PRF. To achieve verifiability we leverage degree-2 algebraic PRGs and bilinear groups. In short, proofs consist of intermediate values of the Goldreich-Goldwasser-Micali PRF raised to the exponents of group elements. These outputs can be verified using pairings since the underlying PRG is of degree 2.\r\n\r\nWe prove the selective security of our construction under the Decisional Square Diffie-Hellman (DSDH) assumption and a new assumption, which we dub recursive Decisional Diffie-Hellman (recursive DDH).\r\n\r\nWe prove the soundness of recursive DDH in the generic group model assuming the hardness of the Multivariate Quadratic (MQ) problem and a new variant thereof, which we call MQ+.\r\n\r\nLast, in terms of applications, we observe that our CVRF is also an exponent (C)VRF in the plain model. Exponent VRFs were recently introduced by Boneh et al. (Eurocrypt\u201925) with various applications to threshold cryptography in mind. In addition to that, we give further applications for prefix-CVRFs in the blockchain setting, namely, stake-pooling and compressible randomness beacons.",

    "abstract": "The Learning With Errors (LWE) problem, introduced by Regev  (STOC'05), is one of the fundamental problems in lattice-based cryptography, believed to be hard even for quantum adversaries. Regev (FOCS'02) showed that LWE reduces to the quantum Dihedral Coset Problem (DCP). Later, Brakerski, Kirshanova, Stehl\u00e9 and Wen (PKC'18) showed that LWE reduces to a generalization known as the Extrapolated Dihedral Coset Problem (EDCP). We present a quasi-polynomial time quantum algorithm for the EDCP problems over power-of-two moduli using a quasi-polynomial number of samples, which also applies to the SLWE problem defined by Chen, Liu, and Zhandry (Eurocrypt'22). Our EDCP algorithm can be viewed as a provable variant to the \"Simon-meets-Kuperberg\" algorithm introduced by Bonnetain and Naya-Plasencia (Asiacrypt'18), adapted to the EDCP setting. We stress that our algorithm does not affect the security of LWE with standard parameters, as the reduction from standard LWE to EDCP limits the number of samples to be polynomial.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we study supersingular elliptic curves primitively oriented by an imaginary quadratic order, where the orientation is determined by an endomorphism that factors through the Frobenius isogeny. In this way, we partly recycle one of the main features of CSIDH, namely the fact that the Frobenius orientation can be represented for free. This leads to the most efficient family of ideal-class group actions in a range where the discriminant is significantly larger than the field characteristic $p$. Moreover, if we orient with a non-maximal order $\\mathcal{O} \\subset \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-p})$ and we assume that it is feasible to compute the  ideal-class group of the maximal order, then also the ideal-class group of $\\mathcal{O}$ is known and we recover the central feature of SCALLOP-like constructions. \r\n\r\nWe propose two variants of our scheme. In the first one, the orientation is by a suborder of the form $\\mathbb{Z}[f\\sqrt{-p}]$ for some $f$ coprime to $p$, so this is similar to SCALLOP. In the second one, inspired by the work of Chenu and Smith, the orientation is by an order of the form $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-dp}]$ where $d$ is square-free and not a multiple of $p$. We give practical ways of generating parameters, together with a proof-of-concept SageMath implementation of both variants, which shows the effectiveness of our construction.",

    "abstract": "We introduce and analyze a novel class of binary operations on finite-dimensional vector spaces over a field \\( K \\), defined by second-order multilinear expressions with linear shifts. These operations generate polynomials whose degree increases linearly with each iterated application, while the number of distinct monomials grows combinatorially. We demonstrate that, despite the non-associative and non-commutative nature in general, these operations exhibit power associativity and internal commutativity when iterated on a single vector. This allows for well-defined exponentiation \\( a^n \\). Crucially, the absence of a simple closed-form expression for \\( a^n \\) suggests a one-way property: computing \\( a^n \\) from \\( a \\) and \\( n \\) is straightforward, but recovering \\( n \\) from \\( a^n \\) (the Discrete Iteration Problem) appears computationally hard. We propose a Diffie\u2013Hellman-like key exchange protocol utilizing these properties over finite fields, defining an Algebraic Diffie\u2013Hellman Problem (ADHP). The proposed structures are of interest for cryptographic primitives, algebraic dynamics, and computational algebra.",

    "abstract": "The Signal protocol is the most widely deployed end-to-end-encrypted messaging protocol. Its initial handshake protocol X3DH allows parties to asynchronously derive a shared session key without the need to be online simultaneously, while providing implicit authentication, forward secrecy, and a form of offline deniability. The X3DH protocol has been extensively studied in the cryptographic literature and is acclaimed for its strong \"maximum-exposure\" security guarantees, hedging against compromises of users' long-term keys and medium-term keys but also the ephemeral randomness used in the handshake. This maximum-exposure security is achieved by deriving keys from the concatenation of 3\u20134 Diffie\u2013Hellman (DH) secrets, each combining two long-term, medium-term, or ephemeral DH shares.\r\n\r\nRemarkably, X3DH's approach of concatenating plain DH combinations is sub-optimal, both in terms of maximum-exposure security and performance. Indeed, Krawczyk's well-known HMQV protocol (Crypto '05) is a high-performance, DH-based key exchange that provides strong security against long-term and ephemeral key compromise. One might hence wonder: why not base Signal's initial handshake on HMQV?\r\n\r\nIn this work, we study this question and show that a carefully adapted variant of HMQV, which we call XHMQV, indeed enables stronger security and efficiency while matching the constraints of Signal's initial handshake. Most notably, HMQV does not work as a drop-in replacement for X3DH, as the latter's asynchronicity requires the protocol to handle cases where one party runs out of ephemeral keys (pre-uploaded to the Signal server). Our XHMQV design hence augments HMQV with medium-term keys analogous to those used in X3DH. We prove that XHMQV provides security in all 3\u20134 compromise scenarios where X3DH does and additionally in 1\u20132 further scenarios, strengthening the handshake's maximum-exposure guarantees while using more efficient group operations. We further confirm that our XHMQV design achieves deniability guarantees comparable to X3DH. Our security model is the first to capture Signal's long-term key reuse between DH key exchange and signatures, which may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Integral attacks exploit structural weaknesses in symmetric cryptographic primitives by analyzing how subsets of inputs propagate to produce outputs with specific algebraic properties. For the case of (XOR) key-alternating block ciphers using (independent) round keys, at ASIACRYPT'21, Hebborn et al. established the first non-trivial lower bounds on the number of rounds required for ensuring integral resistance in a quite general sense. For the case of adding keys by modular addition, no security arguments are known so far. Here, we present a unified framework for analyzing the integral resistance of primitives using (word-wise) modular addition for key whitening, allowing us to not only fill the gap for security arguments, but also to overcome the heavy computational cost inherent in the case of XOR-whitening.",

Built around a 16-round Feistel network, 8 independent pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) ensure strong diffusion and confusion through the generation of per-block unique round keys. With a 1024-bit key and a 64-bit block size, Synergy mitigates vulnerabilities to ML-based cryptanalysis by using a large key size in combination with key- and data-dependent bit rotations, which reduce statistical biases and increase unpredictability. By utilizing 32-bit arithmetic for efficient processing, Synergy achieves high throughput, low latency, and low power consumption, providing performance and security for applications where both are critical.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of combating *viral* misinformation campaigns in end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging systems such as WhatsApp. We propose a new notion of Hop Tracking Signatures (HTS) that allows for tracing originators of messages that have been propagated on long forwarding paths (i.e., gone viral), while preserving anonymity of everyone else. We define security for HTS against malicious servers.   \r\n\r\nWe present both negative and positive results for HTS: on the one hand, we show that HTS does not admit succinct constructions if tracing and anonymity thresholds differ by exactly one \"hop\". On the other hand, by allowing for a larger gap between tracing and anonymity thresholds, we can build succinct HTS schemes where the signature size does not grow with the forwarding path. Our positive result relies on streaming algorithms and strong cryptographic assumptions. \r\n\r\nPrior works on tracing within E2EE messaging systems either do not achieve security against malicious servers or focus only on tracing originators of pre-defined banned content.",

    "abstract": "Garbled circuits, introduced in the seminal work of Yao (FOCS, 1986), have received considerable attention in the boolean setting due to their efficiency and application to round-efficient secure computation. In contrast, arithmetic garbling schemes have received much less scrutiny. The main efficiency measure of garbling schemes is their rate, defined as the bit size of each gate's output divided by the size of the (amortized) garbled gate. Despite recent progress, state-of-the-art garbling schemes for arithmetic circuits suffer from important limitations: all existing schemes are either restricted to $B$-bounded integer arithmetic circuits (a computational model where the arithmetic is performed over $\\mathbb{Z}$ and correctness is only guaranteed if no intermediate computation exceeds the bound $B$) and achieve constant rate only for very large bounds $B = 2^{\\Omega(\\lambda^3)}$, or have a rate at most $O(1/\\lambda)$ otherwise, where $\\lambda$ denotes a security parameter. In this work, we improve this state of affairs in both settings.\r\n\r\n - As our main contribution, we introduce the first arithmetic garbling scheme over modular rings $\\mathbb{Z}_B$ with rate $O(\\log\\lambda/\\lambda)$, breaking for the first time the $1/\\lambda$-rate barrier for modular arithmetic garbling. Our construction relies on the power-DDH assumption.\r\n\r\n - As a secondary contribution, we introduce a new arithmetic garbling scheme for $B$-bounded integer arithmetic that achieves a constant rate for bounds $B$ as low as $2^{O(\\lambda)}$. Our construction relies on a new non-standard KDM-security assumption on Paillier encryption with small exponents.",

    "abstract": "Recent stateful private information retrieval (PIR) schemes have significantly improved amortized computation and amortized communication while aiming to keep client storage minimal. However, all the schemes in the literature still suffer from a poor tradeoff between client storage and computation. \r\nWe present BALANCED-PIR, a stateful PIR scheme that effectively balances computation and client storage. For a database of a million entries, each of 8 bytes, our scheme requires 0.2 MB of client storage, 0.2 ms of amortized computation, and 11.14 KB of amortized communication. Compared with the state-of-the-art scheme using a similar storage setting, our scheme is almost 9x better in amortized computation and 40x better in offline computation. \r\n\r\n\r\nVerifiable private information retrieval has been gaining more attention recently. However, all existing schemes require linear amortized computation and huge client storage. We present Verifiable BALANCED-PIR, a verifiable stateful PIR scheme with sublinear amortized computation and small client storage. \r\nIn fact, our Verifiable BALANCED-PIR adds modest computation, communication, and storage costs on top of BALANCED-PIR.\r\nCompared with the state-of-the-art verifiable scheme, the client storage of our scheme is 100x smaller, the amortized computation is 15x less, and the amortized communication is 2.5x better.",

    "abstract": "Private signaling allows servers to identify a recipient's messages on a public bulletin board without knowing the recipient's metadata. It is a central tool for systems like privacy-preserving blockchains and anonymous messaging. However, unless with TEE, current constructions all assume that the servers are only passively corrupted, which significantly limits their practical relevance. In this work, we present a TEE-free simulation-secure private signaling protocol assuming two non-colluding servers, either of which can be actively corrupted.\r\n \r\nCrucially, we convert signal retrieval into a problem similar to private set intersection and use custom-built zero-knowledge proofs to ensure consistency with the public bulletin board. As a result, our protocol achieves lower server-to-server communication overhead and a much smaller digest compared to state-of-the-art semi-honest protocol. For example, for a board size of $2^{19}$ messages, the resulting digest size is only 33.57KB. Our protocol is also computationally efficient: retrieving private signals only takes about 2 minutes, using 16 threads and a LAN network.",

    "abstract": "Oblivious RAMs (ORAMs) allow data outsourcing to servers so that the access pattern to the outsourced data is kept private. It is also a crucial building block to enable private RAM access within secure multi-party computation (MPC). In recent years, schemes that match the ORAM lower bound have been proposed in both the outsourcing setting and the RAM-model MPC setting, seemingly putting an epilogue in the theory of ORAM. In this paper, we initiate a study of mixed-mode ORAMs, where accesses to the ORAM are a mix of both public and private accesses. Although existing ORAMs can support public access by treating them as private ones, achieving better efficiency is highly non-trivial. \r\n\r\n- We present a mixed-mode ORAM algorithm, assuming the existence of private information retrieval (PIR). When the PIR scheme is communication-efficient, this ORAM achieves the best possible outcome: it has a bandwidth blowup of $O(\\log N)$ for private accesses and $O(1)$ for public accesses. This construction can be easily extended for the MPC setting achieving $O(B\\log N )$ circuit size for private accesses to $B$-sized blocks and $O(B)$ circuit size for public accesses to the same array.\r\n\r\n- We instantiate the above protocol in the three-party computation (3PC) setting with more concrete optimizations, yielding a protocol that performs almost as efficiently as state-of-the-art RAM-3PC protocols for private accesses while being $3\\times$ more efficient for public accesses in the LAN setting.",

    "abstract": "Sponge-based constructions have successfully been receiving widespread adoption, as represented by the standardization of SHA-3 and Ascon by NIST. Yet, their provable security against quantum adversaries has not been investigated much. This paper studies the post-quantum security of some keyed sponge-based constructions in the quantum ideal permutation model, focusing on the Ascon AEAD mode and KMAC as concrete instances. For the Ascon AEAD mode, we prove the post-quantum security in the single-user setting up to about $\\min(2^{c/3},2^{\\kappa/3})$ queries, where $c$ is the capacity and $\\kappa$ is the key length. Unlike the recent work by Lang et al.~(ePrint 2025/411), we do not need non-standard restrictions on nonce sets or the number of forgery attempts. In addition, our result guarantees even non-conventional security notions such as the nonce-misuse resilience confidentiality and authenticity under release of unverified plaintext. For KMAC, we show the security up to about $\\min(2^{c/3}, 2^{r/2},2^{(\\kappa-r)/2})$ queries, where $r$ is the rate, ignoring some small factors. In fact, we prove the security not only for KMAC but also for general modes such as the inner-, outer-, and full-keyed sponge functions.\r\nWe take a modular proof approach, adapting the ideas by several works in the classical ideal permutation model into the quantum setting: For the Ascon AEAD mode, we observe it can be regarded as an iterative application of a Tweakable Even-Mansour (TEM) cipher with a single low-entropy key, and gives the security bound as the sum of the post-quantum TPRP advantage of TEM and the classical security advantage of Ascon when TEM is replaced with a secret random object. The proof for keyed sponges is obtained analogously by regarding them as built on an Even-Mansour (EM) cipher with a single low-entropy key.\r\nThe post-quantum security of (T)EM has been proven by Alagic et al. (Eurocrypt 2022 and Eurocrypt 2024). However, they show the security only when the keys are uniformly random. In addition, the proof techniques, so-called the resampling lemmas, are inapplicable to our case with a low-entropy key. Thus, we introduce and prove a modified resampling lemma, thereby showing the security of (T)EM with a low-entropy key.",

    "abstract": "FROST and its variants are state-of-the-art protocols for threshold Schnorr signatures that are used in real-world applications. While static security of these protocols has been shown by several works, the security of these protocols under adaptive corruptions\u2014where an adversary can choose which parties to corrupt at any time based on information it learns during protocol executions\u2014has remained a notorious open problem that has received renewed attention due to recent standardization efforts for threshold schemes.\r\n\r\nWe show adaptive security (without erasures) of FROST and several variants under different corruption thresholds and computational assumptions. Let n be the total number of parties, t+1 the signing threshold, and t_c an upper bound on the number of corrupted parties.\r\n\r\n1. We prove adaptive security when t_c = t/2 in the random oracle model (ROM) based on the algebraic one-more discrete logarithm assumption (AOMDL)\u2014the same conditions under which FROST is proven statically secure.\r\n\r\n2. We introduce the low-dimensional vector representation (LDVR) problem, parameterized by t_c, t, and n, and prove adaptive security in the algebraic group model (AGM) and ROM based on the AOMDL assumption and the hardness of the LDVR problem for the corresponding parameters. In some regimes (including some t_c >t/2) we show the LDVR problem is unconditionally hard, while in other regimes (in particular, when t_c = t) we show that hardness of the LDVR problem is necessary for adaptive security to hold. In fact, we show that hardness of the LDVR problem is necessary for proving adaptive security of a broad class of threshold Schnorr signatures.",

    "abstract": "In the Social Internet of Vehicles (SIoV), effective data sharing is essential for applications including road safety, traffic management, and situational awareness. However, the decentralized and open nature of SIoV presents significant challenges in simultaneously ensuring data integrity, user privacy, and system accountability. This paper presents a protocol for secure and location-accurate traffic data sharing that fully preserves the anonymity and privacy of participating witnesses. The protocol leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to allow vehicles to broadcast redacted traffic information\u2014such as images\u2014tied to specific geographic locations, while withholding both the original content and the identity of the reporting vehicle. To ensure the authenticity of the redacted content and the legitimacy of the witness, an additional ZKP is used to privately validate both elements. Upon receiving a report, the verifying node checks the submitted proofs, aggregates validated inputs, and publishes the resulting metadata to both IPFS and a blockchain. This design ensures public verifiability, tamper resistance, and the reliability of the shared data, while maintaining strong privacy guarantees through cryptographic anonymity. To improve the efficiency of proof generation on resource-constrained devices, the protocol employs folding-based ZKP constructions. We conduct a formal security and soundness analysis of the protocol and implement a proof-of-concept, which is publicly available as open-source software. Experimental evaluations on commodity hardware demonstrate that the protocol is computationally efficient and introduces less than 1.5\\% communication overhead relative to the size of the shared traffic data, indicating its suitability for real-world deployment.",

    "abstract": "Three-party secret sharing-based computation has emerged as a promising approach for secure deep learning, benefiting from its high throughput. However, it still faces persistent challenges in computing complex operations such as secure Sign-Bit Extraction, particularly in high-latency and low-bandwidth networks.  A recent work, Aegis (Lu et al., Cryptology ePrint'2023), made significant strides by proposing a constant-round DGK-style Sign-Bit Extraction protocol with GPU acceleration on Piranha (Watson et. al., USENIX Security'2022). However, Aegis exhibits two critical limitations: it \\romannumeral1) overlooks the use of \\textit{bit-wise prefix-sum}, and \\romannumeral2) inherits non-optimized modular arithmetic over prime fields and excessive memory overhead from the underlying GPU-based MPC framework. This results in suboptimal performance in terms of communication, computation, and GPU memory usage.\r\n\r\nDriven by the limitations of Aegis, we propose an optimized constant-round secure Sign-Bit Extraction protocol with communication and GPU-specific optimizations. Concretely, we construct a new masked randomized list by exploiting the upper bound of bit-wise prefix-sum to reduce online communication by up to $50\\%$, and integrate fast modular-reduction and kernel fusion techniques to enhance GPU utilization in MPC protocols. Besides, we propose specific optimizations for secure piecewise polynomial approximations and Maxpool computation in neural network evaluations. Finally, we instantiate these protocols as a framework MIZAR and report their improved performance over state-of-the-art GPU-based solutions: \\romannumeral1) For secure Sign-Bit Extraction, we achieve a speedup of $2$--$2.5\\times$ and reduce communication by $2$--$3.5\\times$. \\romannumeral2) Furthermore, we improve the performance of secure evaluation of nonlinear functions and neural networks by $1.5$--$3.5\\times$. \\romannumeral3) Lastly, our framework achieves $10\\%$--$50\\%$ GPU memory savings.",

    "abstract": "Goyal and Goyal demonstrated that extractable witness encryption, when combined with smart-contract equipped proof-of-stake blockchains, can yield powerful cryptographic primitives such as one-time programs and pay-to-use programs. However, no standard model construction for extractable witness encryption is known, and instantiations from alternatives like indistinguishability obfuscation are highly inefficient.\r\n\r\nThis paper circumvents the need for extractable witness encryption by combining signature-based witness encryption (D\u00f6ttling et al.) with witness encryption for KZG commitments (Fleischhacker et al.). Inspired by Goyal et al., we introduce $T+1$-Extractable Witness Encryption for Blockchains ($T+1$-eWEB), a novel primitive that encrypts a secret, making its decryption contingent upon the subsequent block's state. Leveraging $T+1$-eWEBs, we then build a conditional one-time memory, leading to a $T+1$ one-time program ($T+1$-OTP) also conditional on the next block state. Finally, using our $T+1$-OTP, we develop a conditional RAM obfuscation scheme where program execution can be contingent on the blockchain state, thereby enabling applications like pay-to-use programs.\r\n\r\nDespite its theoretical value, our construction is impractical due to a \"bit-by-bit\" signing requirement for the state root and an inefficient method for storing validator keys. We thus posit the construction of a practical $T+1$-OTP as a significant open problem. This work provides the first theoretical pathway for building such primitives without extractable witness encryption, representing a novel step for blockchain-secured cryptography",

    "abstract": "The key encapsulation mechanism FrodoKEM is a post-quantum algorithm based on plain LWE. While it has not been selected by the NIST for standardization, FrodoKEM  shares a lot of similarities with the lattice-based standard ML-KEM and offers strong security assumptions by relying on the unstructured version of the LWE problem. This leads FrodoKEM  to be recommended by European agencies ANSSI and BSI as a possible choice to obtain post-quantum security. In this paper, we discuss the practical aspects of incorporating side-channel protections in FrodoKEM  by describing a fully masked version of the scheme based on several previous works on LWE-based KEMs. Furthermore, we propose an arbitrary order C implementation based on the reference code and a Cortex-M4 implementation with gadgets specialized at order 1 in low level assembly code that incorporates bespoke modifications to thwart (micro-)architectural leakages. Finally, we validate our order 1 gadgets by performing TVLA on a ChipWhisperer.",

    "abstract": "Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) refers to the bidirectional communication and energy flows that allow renewable energy sources to supply supplementary electrical services between electric cars (EVs) and the power grid. Additionally, V2G lowers environmental pollution and energy issues while providing efficient charging services. A PUF-based, reliable, anonymous authentication and key establishment scheme for V2G networks was recently presented by Sungjin Yu et al. In this paper, we show that the Yu et al. protocol is vulnerable to tracking attacks and does not guarantee user anonymity. We also discovered that ephemeral secret leakage attacks can target their scheme. Additionally, we propose a new PUF-based authenticated key establishment scheme for V2G networks that is more effective than the most recent relevant scheme and is resistant to all known attacks. We prove that the presented scheme is semantically secure, and we also simulate our protocol using the Scyther tool.",

    "abstract": "Onion routing is a popular practical approach to anonymous communication, and the subject of a growing body of foundational theoretical work aiming to design efficient schemes with provable anonymity, the strongest notion of which is full anonymity.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, all previous schemes that achieve full anonymity assume the synchronous communication setting, which is unrealistic as real networks may experience message loss and timing attacks that render such schemes insecure. Recently, Ando, Lysyanskaya, and Upfal (TCC '24) took a first step towards addressing the asynchronous setting by constructing an efficient onion routing protocol with the strictly weaker guarantee of differential privacy. Their scheme relies on a new primitive called bruisable onion encryption. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we construct the first efficient fully anonymous onion routing protocol in the asynchronous setting. To do so, we overcome two main technical challenges: First, we develop the first bruisable onion construction that does not leak information about the onion's position on the routing path. Second, we design an onion routing protocol that uses such bruisable onion encryption to achieve full anonymity (rather than just differential privacy). Along the way, we develop a new fully anonymous onion routing protocol in the synchronous setting, which improves on the state of the art in terms of communication complexity and round complexity.\r\n\r\nBoth our protocols are secure against an active adversary corrupting a constant fraction of the nodes (up to <1 for the synchronous protocol, and <1/2 for the asynchronous protocol) and rely on standard cryptographic assumptions (CCA-secure public key encryption and collision-resistant hash functions).",

    "abstract": "Modular arithmetic is the computational backbone of many cryptographic and scientific algorithms.  \r\nIn particular, modular multiplication in a large prime field is computationally expensive and dictates the runtime of many algorithms. While it is relatively easy to utilize vectorization to accelerate batches of independent modular multiplications, our goal is to reduce the latency of a $\\textit{single}$ modular multiplication under a generic prime using vectorization, while maintaining constant-time execution.\r\n\r\nWe investigate the technique of Residue Number System (RNS) Montgomery modular multiplication. We first contribute a unified view of algorithmic optimizations in prior art. This view enables us to further reduce the number of elementwise multiplications in an algorithm with a simplified structure that we prove correct.\r\n\r\nWe explore AVX512 acceleration on CPUs, and show how to map our algorithm to vector instructions. We implement our algorithm in C++ and achieve $\\approx 4 \\times$ speedup, which is nearly maximal, for $1024+$-bit primes on a CPU with AVX512 over optimized library implementations of standard Montgomery modular multiplication algorithms. GPUs contain vector cores that each support tens of physical threads. We show how to intelligently map our algorithm to threads in a vector core, ``overparallelizing'' to minimize latency. We show substantial speedups over a commercial library implementation of standard modular multiplication algorithms across a wide range of prime sizes.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has become integral to modern life, enabling smart cities, healthcare, and industrial automation. However, the increasing connectivity of IoT devices exposes them to various cyber threats, necessitating robust encryption methods. The PRESENT cipher, a lightweight block cipher, is well-suited for resource-constrained IoT environments, offering strong security with minimal computational overhead. This paper explores the application of deep learning (DL) techniques in cryptanalysis, specifically using an Aggregated Perceptron Group (APG) Model, which employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to predict input-output relations for each round of the PRESENT cipher\u2019s encryption, excluding the key. This approach focuses solely on emulating the cipher's Substitution Permutation Network (SPN), capturing its essential structure and revealing the structural flaws in the way data is transformed through rounds. The models are chained together to generate the final ciphertext for any 64-bit plaintext with high accuracy, reducing the probability form a random guess of $2^{64}$. The results demonstrate the potential of DL models in cryptanalysis, providing insights into the security of lightweight ciphers in IoT communications and highlighting the practicality of deep learning for cryptographic analysis on standard computing systems.",

    "abstract": "Payment Channel Networks (PCNs) are the most scalable and trust-minimized solution to Bitcoin's scalability challenges. Within PCNs, connected payer and payee can make arbitrary off-chain transactions through multi-hop payments (MHPs) over payment channel paths, while intermediate relays charge relay fees by providing liquidity. \r\n  However, current MHP protocols face critical security threats including fee-stealing attacks and griefing attacks. In this paper, we identify new fee-stealing attacks targeting most existing MHP protocols. Second, we prove that eliminating griefing attacks in current MHP protocols is impossible by reducing the problem to fair secret exchange. Finally, we introduce Zeus, the first Bitcoin-compatible MHP protocol that is secure against fee-stealing attacks and offers bounded griefing protection against $k$-cost-sensitive adversaries\u2014those who only launch griefing attacks when the expected damage exceeds a $k$ fraction of their own cost. These guarantees are established through rigorous proofs in the Global Universal Composability (GUC) framework. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that Zeus reduces worst-case griefing damage to 28\\% and 75\\% compared to MHP schemes such as AMHL~(NDSS'19) and Blitz~(USENIX SEC'21), respectively. Our results further show that, even under the most adverse configurations within the Lightning Network, Zeus imposes costs on adversaries that are at least ten times greater than their potential damage.",

    "abstract": "Private Set Intersection (PSI) enables two parties to compute the intersection of their private sets without revealing any additional information. While maliciously secure PSI protocols prevent many attacks, adversaries can still exploit them by using inconsistent inputs across multiple sessions. This limitation stems from the definition of malicious security in secure multiparty computation, but is particularly problematic in PSI because: (1) real-world applications---such as Apple\u2019s PSI protocol for CSAM detection and private contact discovery in messaging apps---often require multiple PSI executions over consistent inputs, and (2) the PSI functionality makes it relatively easy for adversaries to infer additional information.\r\n\r\nWe propose {\\em Private Intersection over Committed Sets (PICS)}, a new framework that enforces input consistency across multiple sessions via committed sets. Building on the state-of-the-art maliciously secure PSI framework (i.e., VOLE-PSI [EUROCRYPT 2021]), we present an efficient instantiation of PICS % in the random oracle model using lightweight cryptographic tools. We implement our protocol to demonstrate concrete efficiency. Compared to VOLE-PSI, for input sets of size $2^{24}$, our communication overhead is as low as $1.1\\%$. Our end-to-end performance overhead  is $130\\%$ in the LAN setting and decreases to $80\\%-10\\%$ in the WAN setting with bandwidths ranging from $200$ to $5$ Mbps.",

    "abstract": "We make the case for modeling unitary oracles by allowing for controlled access to the oracle as well as its conjugate transpose (inverse), but also its conjugate and transpose. Controlling and conjugate transposes are common if even standard, but conjugates and transposes appear to be non-standard. In order to justify our modeling, we give several formal examples of what goes wrong or is missed when using a more restrictive modeling. We also argue that our model is the \"right\" level of granularity, and that other transformations likely do not correspond to efficient computation. We also discuss other modeling choices, such as ancillas and approximation error. \r\n\r\nThrough our exploration, we uncover interesting phenomena. Examples include an attack on the recent pseudorandom unitary construction of Ma and Huang (STOC'25) if used incorrectly as a publicly evaluatable unitary, and a quantum complexity-theoretic separation that follows from a purely classical separation.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is composed of interconnected devices that exchange data over a network,\r\nenabling applications in healthcare, transportation, and smart environments. As IoT ecosystems expand,\r\nensuring security and privacy remains a critical challenge. Many IoT devices rely on wireless\r\nnetworks for data transmission, making them vulnerable to eavesdropping, tracking, and tampering.\r\nThis highlights the need for robust authentication mechanisms. To address these concerns, numerous\r\nauthentication protocols have been proposed. However, many fail to ensure adequate security against\r\nboth passive and active attacks. In this research, we introduce LAPWN, a lightweight protocol for\r\nuser\u2013server communication, specifically designed for constrained environments, ensuring a balance\r\nbetween security and efficiency. The proposed protocol is implemented as a fully functional Python\r\napplication, demonstrating its practical usability and evaluating its efficiency in real-world scenarios.\r\nTo validate its security, we performboth informal and formal analyses, utilizing Scyther, ProVerif, and\r\nthe Real-or-Random (RoR) model. The results confirm that LAPWN provides a secure, lightweight,\r\nand efficient authentication solution with low computational and communication overhead. Furthermore,\r\nperformance evaluations show that it surpasses existing authentication protocols, making it a\r\nhighly effective solution for secure user\u2013server interactions in constrained environments.",

    "abstract": "The stake delegation technique is what turns the general Proof of Stake (PoS) into a practical protocol for a large number of participants, ensuring the security of the distributed system, in what is known as Delegated PoS (DPoS). Karakostas et al. (SCN \u201920) formalized the delegation method paving the way for a whole industry of stake pools by proposing a formal definition for wallet as a universal composable (UC) functionality and introducing a corresponding protocol. On the other hand, a widely used technique named hot/cold wallet was formally studied by Das et al. (CCS \u201919 and \u201921), and Groth and Shoup (Eurocrypt \u201922) for different key derivation methods in the Proof of Work (PoW) setting, but not PoS. Briefly, while hot wallets are exposed to the risks of the network, the cold wallet is kept offline, thus more secure. However this may impair some capabilities given that the cold wallet is kept indefinitely offline. It is straightforward to observe that this \u201cdouble wallet\u201d design is not naturally portable to the setting where delegation is paramount, i.e., DPoS. This work identifies challenges for PoS Hot/Cold Wallet and proposes a secure and practical protocol.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of minimizing the total weight of (potentially many) participants of a distributed protocol, a necessary step when the original values are large but the scheme to be deployed scales poorly with the weights. We assume that $\\alpha$ fraction of the original weights can be corrupted and we must output new weights with at most $\\beta$ adversarial fraction, for $\\alpha < \\beta$. This problem can be viewed from the prism of electing a small committee that does the heavy work, a powerful tool for making distributed protocols scalable. We solve the variant that requires giving parties potentially multiple seats in the committee and counting each seat towards the cost of the solution. Moreover, we focus on the ``deterministic'' version of the problem where the computed committee must be secure for any subset of parties that can be corrupted by the adversary; such a committee can be smaller than a randomly sampled one in some cases and is useful when security against adaptive corruptions is desired but parties in the sub-protocol speak multiple times.\r\n\r\nPresented are new algorithms for the problem as well as analysis of prior work. We give two variants of the algorithm Swiper (PODC 2024), one that significantly improves the running time without sacrificing the quality of the output and the other improving the output for a reasonable increase in the running time. We prove, however, that all known algorithms, including our two variants of Swiper, have worst case approximation ratio $\\Omega(n)$. To counter that, we give the first polynomial time algorithm with approximation factor $n / \\log^2 n$ and also the first sub-exponential time exact algorithm, practical for some real-world inputs. Of theoretical interest is another polytime algorithm that we present, based on linear programming, whose output is no worse than an optimal solution to the problem with slightly different parameters.\r\n\r\nWe implemented and tested previous and new algorithms, comparing them on the stake distributions of popular proof-of-stake blockchains, and found that our second variant of Swiper computes solutions extremely close to the optimal, confirmed by our exact algorithm.",

    "abstract": "The VOLE-in-the-Head (VOLEitH) paradigm transforms VOLE-based zero-knowledge proofs into post-quantum signature schemes by allowing public verification. We introduce reduced VOLE-in-the-Head (rVOLEitH), which incorporates the Vector Semi-Commitment (VSC) technique. VSC, originally developed for MPC-in-the-Head (MPCitH) schemes, reduces commitment size while maintaining security by relaxing the binding property. We adapt the ideal cipher version of VSC (IC-VSC) into the VOLEitH framework, leading to a reduction in signature size. Our security analysis proves that rVOLEitH achieves existential unforgeability under chosen-message attacks (EUF-CMA) in the ideal cipher model. Compared to existing VOLEitH-based signatures, our approach reduces signature size by up to 6.0\\% while improving computational efficiency.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we analyze the impact of eliminating individual seed commitments and demonstrate a practical attack against a recently proposed VOLEitH variant that lacks such commitments. Our results establish rVOLEitH as an optimized and secure alternative for post-quantum signatures, improving both efficiency and security in the VOLEitH paradigm.",

We present a concretely efficient version of the reduction for such groups.\r\n In particular, among practically relevant groups, we obtain the most efficient and tightest reduction in the literature for BLS12-381, showing that $\\mathsf{DL}$ = $\\mathsf{CDH}$.\r\n2.      By generalizing the reduction, we show that in these groups the $n$-Power $\\mathsf{DL}$ ($n$-$\\mathsf{PDL}$) assumption implies $n$-Diffie-Hellman Exponent ($n$-$\\mathsf{DHE}$) assumption, where $n$ is polynomial in the security parameter.\r\nOn the negative side, we show there is no generic reduction, which could demonstrate that $n$-$\\mathsf{PDL}$ implies the $n$-Generalized Diffie-Hellman Exponent ($n$-$\\mathsf{GDHE}$) assumption.\r\nThis is in stark contrast with the algebraic group model, where this implication holds.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a novel systematic approach for obtaining leftover hash lemmas (LHLs) over cyclotomic rings. Such LHLs build a fundamental tool in lattice-based cryptography, both in theoretical reductions as well as in the design of cryptographic primitives. The scattered set of prior works makes it difficult to navigate the landscape and requires a substantial effort to understand the mathematical constraints under which the LHL holds over cyclotomic rings. This is especially painful if one\u2019s given setting does not fit exactly into prior studies. \r\n\r\nWe argue that all prior approaches boil down to two different proof strategies, resulting in two main theorems. From there on, we are able to recover all previous flavours of seemingly independent LHLs as corollaries. Moreover, we showcase the power of our interpretation by providing new statements, covering mathematical settings not considered before. Our work further proves LHLs in the presence of leakage for both approaches and provides novel bounds for wide families of leakage functions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\r\nSecure two-party computation (2PC) is a cryptographic technique that enables two mutually distrusting parties to jointly evaluate a function over their private inputs. We consider a 2PC primitive called confidential lookup table (LUT) evaluation, which is useful in privacy-preserving ML inference and data analytics. In this setting, a server holds a confidential LUT and evaluates it over an input secret-shared between a client and the server, producing a secret-shared output. Existing approaches for 2PC LUT evaluation suffer from high asymptotic complexity and practical inefficiency, with some designs lacking confidentiality guarantees for the LUT. Recognizing that many applications involving confidential LUT evaluation require processing multiple inputs with the same LUT, we propose FABLE, a system designed to efficiently evaluate a LUT on a large batch of queries simultaneously. Compared to the state-of-the-art confidential LUT evaluation methods, FABLE achieves up to 28.46-101.47$\\times$ speedup in LAN environments and up to 50.10-392.93$\\times$ speedup in WAN environments.",

    "abstract": "We present Treebeard - the first scalable and fault tolerant Oblivious RAM (ORAM) based datastore designed to protect applications from access pattern attacks. Current ORAM systems face challenges in practical adoption due to their limited ability to handle concurrent workloads, scale effectively, and ensure fault tolerance. We address all three limitations in Treebeard by utilizing a multi-layer architecture that scales horizontally, handling thousands of requests in parallel, while replicating the data to prevent data loss upon failures. Experimental evaluation demonstrates Treebeard's ability to scale linearly, achieving a throughput of 160K ops/sec with 16 machines; this behavior is similar to the enclave-based state-of-the-art, Snoopy. Being fault-tolerant, Treebeard recovers from failures with close to zero downtime and achieves 13.8x the throughput of QuORAM, the latest fault tolerant ORAM system, even without scaling.",

    "abstract": "An oblivious pseudorandom function (OPRF) is a cryptographic tool that enables fast and secure authentication and key derivation from passwords. In the past few years, the adoption of OPRFs has flourished and today they are at the core of the PIN-protected backup methods of WhatsApp and Signal, and of privacy-enhancing browser technologies. All vendors deploy the so-called 2Hash-Diffie-Hellman (2HashDH) OPRF, which relies on discrete-logarithm-type assumptions that are standard yet known to be prone to quantum attacks.\r\n\r\nRecent advancements in cryptographic research (e.g., Dodgson et al., Eurocrypt 2025) have brought up post-quantum OPRFs that are fast enough to deploy them in the setting of, e.g., WhatsApp or Signal. Yet none of these constructions %that achieves the required level of security e.g., for WhatsApps backup protocol are based on standard assumptions.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we investigate combiners for OPRFs, namely a ``best-of-both'' combination of a classical and a post-quantum OPRF that is secure as long as one of them is. First, we give formal evidence that so-called black-box combiners do not exist, indicating that combining OPRFs is subtle and bears similarities with other powerful yet hard-to-combine cryptographic primitives like oblivious transfer (OT).\r\n\r\nWe then give a (non-black-box) combiner for OPRFs and show that it can be instantiated with 2HashDH and the currently most efficient post-quantum OPRFs based on Legendre symbols. In particular, the reliance on the less standard Legendre-based hardness assumption does not harm the security of 2HashDH. This gives vendors a viable path to lift the security of their OPRF deployments to a post-quantum level.",

    "abstract": "Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are a fundamental building block in cryptography, enabling powerful privacy-preserving and verifiable computations. In the post-quantum era, hash-based ZKPs have emerged as a promising direction due to their conjectured resistance to quantum attacks, along with their simplicity and efficiency.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we introduce SmallWood, a hash-based polynomial commitment scheme (PCS) and zero-knowledge argument system optimized for relatively small instances. Building on the recent degree-enforcing commitment scheme (DECS) from the Threshold-Computation-in-the-Head (TCitH) framework, we refine its formalization and combine it with techniques from Brakedown. This results in a new hash-based PCS that is particularly efficient for polynomials of relatively small degree \u2014typically up to $2^{16}$\u2014 outperforming existing approaches in this range.\r\n\r\nLeveraging this new PCS, we design a hash-based zero-knowledge argument system that outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of proof sizes for witness size ranging from $2^6$ to $2^{16}$. Additionally, we present exact zero-knowledge arguments for lattice-based problems using SmallWood, demonstrating highly competitive performance: our scheme yields proof sizes under 25 KB across a wide range of lattice parameters, including Kyber and Dilithium instances.",

    "abstract": "Atomic swaps enable asset exchanges across blockchains without relying on trusted intermediaries, and are a key component of decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. Recently, Chung, Masserova, Shi, and Thyagarajan introduced Rapidash (Financial Cryptography 2025), an atomic swap protocol that remains incentive compatible under user-miner collusion, by ensuring that the honest strategy forms a coalition-resistant Nash equilibrium. However, their model assumes a closed system where players act solely based on internal protocol incentives. In practice, participants may be influenced by external incentives such as off-chain rewards or adversarial bribes, which can undermine such equilibrium guarantees.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we introduce a new game-theoretic notion, bounded maximin fairness, which ensures that honest participants remain protected against rational adversaries with arbitrary but bounded external incentives. We construct an atomic swap protocol that satisfies this notion, while preserving the equilibrium properties of prior work in the absence of external influence.\r\n\r\nAs we show, our protocol is easy to implement and can be instantiated even in Bitcoin\u2019s limited scripting language.",

    "abstract": "We study several problems in the intersection of cryptography and complexity theory based on the following high-level thesis. \r\n    \r\n1) Obfuscation can serve as a general-purpose worst-case to average-case reduction, reducing the existence of various forms of cryptography to corresponding worst-case assumptions.\r\n2) We can therefore hope to overcome barriers in cryptography and average-case complexity by (i) making worst-case hardness assumptions beyond $\\mathsf{P}\\neq \\mathsf{NP}$, and (ii) leveraging worst-case hardness reductions, either proved by traditional complexity-theoretic methods or facilitated further by cryptography. \r\n\r\nConcretely, our results include:\r\n    - Optimal hardness. Assuming sub-exponential indistinguishability obfuscation, we give fine-grained worst-case to average case reductions for circuit-SAT. In particular, if finding an $\\mathsf{NP}$-witness requires nearly brute-force time in the worst case, then the same is true for some efficiently sampleable distribution. In fact, we show that under these assumptions, there exist families of one-way functions with optimal time-probability security tradeoffs. \r\n\r\n   Under an additional, stronger assumption -- the optimal non-deterministic hardness of refuting circuit-SAT -- we construct additional cryptographic primitives such as PRGs and public-key encryption that have such optimal time-advantage security tradeoffs.\r\n\r\n- Direct Product Hardness. Again assuming $i\\mathcal O$ and optimal non-deterministic hardness of SAT refutation, we show that the ``(search) $k$-fold SAT problem'' -- the computational task of finding satisfying assignments to $k$ circuit-SAT instances simultaneously -- has (optimal) hardness roughly $(T/2^n)^k$ for time $T$ algorithms. In fact, we build ``optimally secure one-way product functions'' (Holmgren-Lombardi, FOCS '18), demonstrating that optimal direct product theorems hold for some choice of one-way function family. \r\n\r\n- Single-Input Correlation Intractability. Assuming either $i\\mathcal O$ or $\\mathsf{LWE}$, we show a worst-case to average-case reduction for strong forms of single-input correlation intractability. That is, powerful forms of correlation-intractable hash functions exist provided that a collection of \\emph{worst-case} ``correlation-finding'' problems are hard.\r\n   \r\n- Non-interactive Proof of Quantumness. Assuming sub-exponential $i\\mathcal O$ and OWFs, we give a non-interactive proof of quantumness based on the worst-case hardness of the white-box Simon problem. In particular, this proof of quantumness result does not explicitly assume quantum advantage for an average-case task.\r\n\r\nTo help prove our first two results, we show along the way how to improve the Goldwasser-Sipser ``set lower bound'' protocol to have communication complexity quadratically smaller in the multiplicative approximation error $\\epsilon$.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel homomorphic trace evaluation algorithm $\\mathsf{RevHomTrace}$, which mitigates the phase amplification problem that comes with the definition of the field trace. Our $\\mathsf{RevHomTrace}$ overcomes the phase amplification with only a negligible computational overhead, thereby improving the usability of the homomorphic field trace algorithm. Moreover, our tweak also improves the noise propagation of the $\\mathsf{HomTrace}$ and breaks the traditional $O(N^{3})$ variance bound in previous works into $O(N \\log N)$. \r\n\r\nOur experimental results obtained by integrating $\\mathsf{RevHomTrace}$ into state-of-the-art homomorphic encryption algorithms further demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithm. Specifically, $\\mathsf{RevHomTrace}$ improves the noise accumulation of the (high precision) circuit bootstrapping, which also achieves maximal $1.40\\times$ speedup by replacing the costly high precision trace evaluation. Also, based on our idea of $\\mathsf{RevHomTrace}$, we present low latency, high precision LWE-to-GLWE packing algorithm $\\mathtt{MS}$-$\\mathtt{PackLWEs}$. We also show that our $\\mathtt{MS}$-$\\mathtt{PackLWEs}$ significantly reduces the packing error without severe degradation of performance.",

    "abstract": "A rugged pseudorandom permutation (RPRP) is a security notion for variable-length tweakable ciphers that is strictly weaker than the traditional notion of a strong pseudorandom permutation. Being a weaker security notion it admits more efficient constructions. Yet the notion is strong enough so that any such construction can lend itself to a number of practical applications. It can be used to construct onion encryption, misuse-resistant AEAD, and AEAD secure under the release of unverified plaintext. Two recent works have introduced the notion, explored some of its applications, and studied a number of constructions that meet this notion. However, no constructions are known to achieve this notion with beyond-birthday-bound security. Current cloud applications are processing amounts of data that go well beyond the traditional $2^{32}$ barrier, and $2^{64}$ is becoming the new target. As such, the need for encryption with beyond-birthday-bound security has become a very practical concern. In this work, we present the first constructions for variable-length tweakable ciphers that satisfy RPRP security beyond the birthday bound. From these constructions, we readily obtain efficient AEAD schemes that are optimally secure against once misuse and the release of unverified plaintext.",

    "abstract": "The Signal protocol relies on a handshake protocol, formerly X3DH and now PQXDH, to set up secure conversations. One of its privacy properties, of value to Signal, is deniability, allowing users to deny participation in communications. Prior analyses of deniability for these protocols, including post-quantum variants, use models highly tailored to the individual protocols and generally make ad-hoc adaptations to ``standard'' AKE definitions, obscuring the concrete deniability guarantees and complicating comparisons across protocols. Building on Hashimoto et al.\u2019s abstraction for Signal handshake protocols (USENIX\u201925)'s abstraction for Signal handshake protocols (USENIX'25), we address this gap by presenting a unified framework for analyzing their deniability. We analyze Signal's classically secure X3DH and harvest-now-decrypt-later-secure PQXDH, and show that PQXDH is deniable against harvest-now-judge-later attacks, where a quantum judge retrospectively assesses the participation of classical users. We further analyze post-quantum alternatives like RingXKEM, whose deniability relies on ring signatures (RS).\r\nBy introducing a novel metric inspired by differential privacy, we provide relaxed, pragmatic guarantees for deniability. We also use this metric to define deniability for RS, a relaxation of anonymity, allowing us to build an efficient RS from NIST-standardized Falcon (and MAYO), which is not anonymous, but is provably deniable.",

    "abstract": "Cryptographic security protocols, such as TLS or WireGuard, form the foundation of a secure Internet; hence, a long line of research has shown how to formally verify their high-level designs. Unfortunately, these formal guarantees have not yet reached real-world implementations of these protocols, which still rely on testing and ad-hoc manual audits for security and correctness. This gap may be explained, in part, by the substantial performance and/or development overhead imposed by prior efforts to verify implementations.\r\n\r\nTo make it more practical to deploy verified implementations of security protocols, we present OwlC, the first fully automated, security-preserving compiler for verified, high-performance implementations of security protocols. From a high-level protocol specification proven computationally secure in the Owl language, OwlC emits an efficient, interoperable, side-channel resistant Rust library that is automatically formally verified to be correct.\r\n\r\nWe produce verified libraries for all previously written Owl protocols, and we also evaluate OwlC on two new verified case studies: WireGuard and Hybrid Public-Key Encryption (HPKE). Our verified implementations interoperate with existing implementations, and their performance matches unverified industrial baselines on end-to-end benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "BBS/BBS+ signatures are the most promising solution to instantiate practical and lightweight anonymous credentials. They underlie standardization efforts by the W3C and the IRTF. Due to their potential for large scale deployment, it is paramount to understand their concrete security, but a number of questions have been left open by prior works. To this end, the security proofs by Au et al. (SCN '06), Camenisch et al. (TRUST '16), and Tessaro and Zhu (EUROCRYPT '23) show reductions from $q$-SDH in groups of prime order $p$, where $q$ is the number of issued signatures. \r\n    \r\n    However, these prior works left the possibility open that BBS/BBS+ is \"even more secure\" than what can be guaranteed by such proofs. Indeed, while the $q$-SDH assumption is subject to an attack that uses $O(\\sqrt{p/q})$ group exponentiations (Cheon, EUROCRYPT '06) for several choices of $q$, no attack with a similar complexity appears to affect either of BBS+ and \"deterministic\" BBS, for which the best known attacks amount to recovering the secret key by breaking the discrete logarithm problem. The assumption that this attack is best possible also seemingly justifies the choice of parameters in practice.\r\n\r\n    Our result shows that this expectation is not true. We show new attacks against BBS+ and deterministic BBS which, after seeing $q$ signatures, allow us to recover the secret key with the same complexity as solving the $\\Theta(q)$-Discrete Logarithm problem, which in turn is proportional to $O(\\sqrt{p/q})$ for many choices of $q$. Further, we also extend the attack to a reduction showing that the security of BBS+ and deterministic BBS implies the $\\Theta(q)$-SDH assumption.",

    "abstract": "Identity-based signature ($\\textsf{IBS}$) schemes eliminate the need for certificate management, reducing both signature size and verification time. However, the challenge of updating stolen identity-based signature keys (or revoking and re-issueing them) has received limited attention. Existing generic solutions, such as managing revocation lists or periodically renewing user keys, are inefficient and introduce significant networking overhead in dynamic environments.\r\nIn this work, we address this gap by introducing a symmetric element that enables key updates in $\\textsf{IBS}$ schemes via a single multicast message. The network overhead of our solutions scales logarithmic with the number of system users, while computation and memory overhead are constant. Furthermore, we generalize our method by proposing a framework to transform any $\\textsf{IBS}$ scheme into a key-updatable signature scheme ($\\textsf{KUSS}$), and we define the token security (unforgeability), forward security, and post-compromise security requirements for such transformations. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework by providing five instantiations of $\\textsf{KUSS}$ based on Schnorr-type $\\textsf{IBS}$, pairing-based $\\textsf{IBS}$, and isogeny-based $\\textsf{IBS}$. Finally, we analyze the security of these instantiations.",

    "abstract": "The module-Lattice Isomorphism Problem (module-LIP) was introduced by Ducas et al. (ASIACRYPT 22) in~\\cite{HAWK:cryptoeprint:2022/1155}, and used within the signature scheme and NIST candidate HAWK. In~\\cite{modLIPtotallyreal}, by Mureau et al (Eurocrypt24), it was pointed out that over certain number fields $F$, the problem can be reduced to enumerating solutions of $x^2 + y^2 = q$ (where $q \\in \\O_F$ is given and $x,y \\in \\O_F$ are the unknowns). Moreover one can always reduce to a similar equation which has only \\textit{few} solutions. This key insight led to a heuristic polynomial-time algorithm for solving module-LIP on those specific instances. Yet this result doesn't threaten HAWK for which the problem can be reduced to enumerating solutions of $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + t^2 = q$ (where $q \\in \\O_F$ is given and $x,y,z,t \\in \\O_F$ are the unknowns). We show that, in all likelihood, solving this equation requires the enumeration of a \\textit{too large} set to be feasible, thereby making irrelevant a straightforward adaptation of the approach in~\\cite{modLIPtotallyreal}.",

    "abstract": "Privacy-preserving neural network inference using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) faces significant challenges in efficiently evaluating non-polynomial functions, such as activation functions, which are critical for introducing non-linearity in neural networks. Full-Domain Functional Bootstrap (FDFB) algorithms provide a promising solution by enabling the evaluation of arbitrary functions while simultaneously refreshing ciphertexts to manage noise accumulation. Despite their theoretical advantages, the practicality of FDFB algorithms has been limited by excessive computational overhead, often exceeding 1000 ms per ciphertext, which restricts their scalability for large neural networks.\r\n\r\nTo overcome the computational bottlenecks of FDFB, we have re-engineered the algorithms for massively parallel execution on GPUs. Our primary contribution is a hierarchical parallelization strategy that exploits concurrency at the thread, stream, and device levels. A key optimization involves the use of CUDA streams to create a data pipeline that effectively mitigates the overhead of memory transfers between the host and device. This optimized architecture achieves a significant speedup of up to 524$\\times$ compared to CPU-based implementations. Our implementation maintains full precision for evaluating various activation functions, confirming its viability for large-scale, privacy-preserving machine learning tasks and paving the way for practical FHE-based deep learning.",

    "abstract": "The multistep solving strategy consists in a divide-and-conquer approach: when a multivariate polynomial system is computationally infeasible to solve directly, one variable is assigned over the elements of the base finite field, and the procedure is recursively applied to the resulting simplified systems. In a previous work by the same authors (among others), this approach proved effective in the algebraic cryptanalysis of the Trivium cipher.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present a new implementation of the corresponding algorithm based on a Depth-First Search strategy, along with a novel complexity analysis leveraging tree structures. We further introduce the notion of an ``oracle function'' as a general predictive tool for deciding whether the evaluation of a new variable is necessary to simplify the current polynomial system. This notion allows us to unify all previously proposed variants of the multistep strategy, including the classical hybrid approach, by appropriately selecting the oracle function.\r\n\r\nFinally, we apply the multistep solving strategy to the cryptanalysis of the low-latency block cipher Aradi, recently introduced by the NSA. We present the first full-round algebraic attack, raising concerns about the cipher\u2019s actual security with respect to its key length.",

    "abstract": "We describe an algorithm to efficiently evaluate class group actions on supersingular elliptic curves that are oriented by an imaginary quadratic order of arbitrarily large discriminant. Contrary to CSIDH, this allows to increase the post-quantum security of the group action without increasing the size of the base field. In particular, we describe instances where Kuperberg's algorithm loses to generic supersingular isogeny path finding. Our algorithm is fully deterministic, strictly constant time, dummy free, and can be implemented without conditional branches. We show that the (restricted effective) group action can be employed in a non-interactive key exchange protocol, that we argue is asymptotically more efficient than CSIDH.",

A dynamic accumulator, furthermore, allows elements to be added to and deleted from the accumulator.

In this paper, we give a lattice-based dynamic accumulator tailor-made for enabling revocation of post-quantum anonymous credential systems.

    "abstract": "Blind signatures are fundamental cryptographic primitives enabling privacy-preserving authentication and have seen renewed interest in the post-quantum literature. \r\nExisting efficient constructions predominantly rely on Fischlin\u2019s generic paradigm instantiated over lattice assumptions, while blinding techniques for sigma-protocol-based blind signatures remain sparse beyond lattices. Moreover, achieving provable concurrent security under polynomially many sessions has been a longstanding open challenge for this approach in the post-quantum literature as evidenced by the recent attacks in EC\u201924 and PKC\u201924. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis work broadens the landscape of post-quantum blind signatures by introducing novel techniques and proposing four frameworks based on general cryptographic group actions, without requiring commutativity. Our constructions admit instantiations under diverse post-quantum assumptions, including CSIDH (isogeny-based), LESS (code-based, NIST round-two), and more. These frameworks offer flexible trade-offs in assumptions (from interactive one-more to the standard inversion problem) and key/signature sizes, and culminate in a construction that achieves security under polynomially many concurrent sessions. This enables the first efficient blind signatures from isogenies and codes with provable concurrent security with 3.9 and 56 KB respectively. We also outline several directions for optimization and further instantiations for future work.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring privacy of online messaging remains a challenge.  While the contents or data of online communications are often protected by end-to-end encryption, the metadata of communications are not.  Metadata such as who is communicating with whom, how much, and how often, are leaked by popular messaging systems today.\r\n\r\nIn the last four decades we have witnessed a rich literature of designs towards metadata-protecting communications systems (MPCS).  While recent MPCS works often target metadata-protected messaging systems, no existing construction simultaneously attains four desirable properties for messaging systems, namely (i) low latency, (ii) high throughput, (iii) horizontal scalability, and (iv) asynchronicity.  Existing designs often capture disjoint subsets of these properties.  For example, PIR-based approaches achieve low latency and asynchronicity but have low throughput and lack horizontal scalability, mixnet-based approaches achieve high throughput and horizontal scalability but lack asynchronicity, and approaches based on trusted execution environments (TEEs) achieve high throughput and asynchronicity but lack horizontal scalability.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we present TEEMS, the first MPCS designed for metadata-protected messaging that simultaneously achieves all four desirable properties. Our distributed TEE-based system uses an oblivious mailbox design to provide metadata-protected messaging.  TEEMS presents novel oblivious routing protocols that adapt prior work on oblivious distributed sorting.  Moreover, we introduce the notion of ID and token channels to circumvent shortcomings of prior designs.  We empirically demonstrate TEEMS' ability to support $2^{20}$ clients engaged in metadata-protected conversations in under 1 s, with 205 cores, achieving an 18\u00d7 improvement over prior work for latency and throughput, while supporting significantly better scalability and asynchronicity properties.",

    "abstract": "We develop a toolbox for modular construction and analysis of succinct, non-interactive commitments and vector commitments in the random oracle model, while guaranteeing universally composable security. To demonstrate its power, we use the toolbox to construct and analyze a modular variant of the Kilian-Micali ZK-SNARK. Along the way we also propose a new UC formulation of a global random oracle, that avoids a weakness in existing formulations and also enables expressing more nuanced, session-specific abstractions. We hope that this toolbox will be useful for building secure applications in settings where both succinctness and non-interactivity are key.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new iterative method to convert a ciphertext from the Generalized BFV (GBFV) to the regular BFV scheme. In particular, our conversion starts from an encrypted plaintext that lives in a large cyclotomic ring modulo a small-norm polynomial $t(x)$, and gradually changes the encoding to a smaller cyclotomic ring modulo a larger integer $p$. Previously, only a trivial conversion method was known, which did not change the underlying cyclotomic ring.\r\n\r\nUsing our improved conversion algorithm, we can bootstrap the GBFV scheme almost natively, in the sense that only a very small fraction of the operations is computed inside regular BFV. Specifically, we evaluate (an adapted version of) the slot-to-coefficient transformation entirely in the GBFV scheme, whereas the previous best method used the BFV scheme for that transformation. This insight allows us to bootstrap either with less noise growth, or much faster than the state-of-the-art.\r\n\r\nWe implement our new bootstrapping in Microsoft SEAL. Our experiments show that, for the same remaining noise budget, our bootstrapping runs in only 800 ms when working with ciphertexts containing 1024 slots over $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ with $p = 2^{16}+1$. This is $1.6\\times$ faster than the state-of-the-art.\r\n\r\nFinally, we use our improved GBFV bootstrapping in an application that computes an encrypted edit distance. Compared to the recent TFHE-based Leuvenshtein algorithm, our GBFV version is almost two orders of magnitude faster in the amortized sense.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to zero-trust anonymous reputation update in crowd sensing IoT applications. We use a suite of cryptographic functions to achieve anonymity, including unlinkability of sensing reports to the principals that submit them and to one another, while enabling the infrastructure to reliably quantify the degree of trust expressed as a reputation level. The protocol is low-cost for the anonymous participant due to the use of cheap standard algorithms: low-exponent modular exponentia- tion and cryptographic hashing, which makes it quite suitable for IoT.",

    "abstract": "Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) is becoming more and more usable in practice. The practicality origins primarily from well-established general-purpose MPC frameworks, such as MP-SPDZ. However, to evaluate the practicality of an MPC program in the envisioned environments, still many benchmarks need to be done. We identified three challenges in the context of performance evaluations within the MPC domain: first, the cumbersome process to holistically benchmark MPC programs; second, the difficulty to find the best-possible MPC setting for a given task and envisioned environment; and third, to have consistent evaluations of the same task or problem area across projects and papers. In this work, we address the gap of tedious and complex benchmarking of MPC. Related works so far mostly provide a comparison for certain programs with different engines.\r\n\r\nTo the best of our knowledge, for the first time the whole benchmarking pipeline is automated; provided by our open-sourced framework Holistic Benchmarking for MPC (b4M). b4M is easy to configure using TOML files, outputs ready-to-use graphs, and provides even the MPC engine itself as own benchmark dimension. Furthermore it takes three relatively easy steps to add further engines: first, integrate engine-specific commands into b4M\u2019s runner class; second, output performance metrics in b4M\u2019s format; third, provide a Docker container for the engine\u2019s parties.\r\n\r\nTo showcase b4M, we provide an exemplary evaluation for the computation of the dot product and logistic regression using a real-world dataset. With this work, we move towards fully-automated evaluations of MPC programs, protocols, and engines, which smoothens the setup process and viewing various trade-offs. Hence, b4M advances MPC development by improving the benchmarking usability aspect of it.",

    "abstract": "Minimizing both the round and communication complexity of Byzantine agreement (BA) is fundamental question in distributed computing. A long line of works has focused on early-stopping deterministic protocols that can terminate within a number of synchronous rounds that is proportional to $f$, where $f$ is the \\emph{actual number} of corruptions in an execution, as opposed to an upper bound $t$. This can lead to major benefits when $f\\ll t$. A very different style of randomized protocol has focused on \\emph{player replaceable} BA protocols with communication complexity linear in the number of parties $n$ and adaptive security, which rely on only a small and rotating subcommittee of parties to ever speak in the protocol. One downside of existing player-replaceable protocols is that they require $O(r)$ rounds to terminate with overwhelming probability $1-2^r$.\r\n    For applications demanding high security guarantees, this can easily become the bottleneck of a player replaceable protocol. Motivated by this gap in the literature, we give the first protocol that is simultaneously player-replaceable \\emph{and} early stopping (with overwhelming probability). Let $1>\\alpha>0$ and $1>\\epsilon>0$ be constants and let $\\lambda$ and $\\kappa$ denote suitable security parameters. Our protocol is secure against up to $t<(1-\\alpha)\\cdot n/2$ adaptive Byzantine corruptions and terminates in $(1+\\epsilon)\\cdot f$ many rounds with probability $1-2^\\lambda$, given $f\\leq t$ corruptions. Moreover, our protocol has constant expected round complexity and communication bounded by $O(n\\cdot \\lambda^3 \\cdot \\kappa ).$",

(Eurocrypt 23).\r\n\r\nWe also explore various optimizations to our basic protocol, including reducing the receiver's concrete run time, and a tradeoff between crs size and message size.",

We identify a subclass of languages, which we denote as traversable, and demonstrate how traversable languages can be efficiently compiled as circuits using established techniques.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the efficacy of our compilation framework, we develop a zkVM for the Nock programming language by (1) formalizing the existing Nock specification, and (2) applying our techniques to design an efficient IOP representation for the Nock VM. The resulting circuit is small, on par with existing state-of-the-art zkVM designs and can be generated for any traversable language in a generic way.",

    "abstract": "Secure evaluation of non-linear functions is one of the most expensive operations in secure two-party computation, particularly for activation functions in privacy preserving machine learning (PPML). This work introduces SEAF, a novel framework for efficient Secure Evaluation on Activation Functions. SEAF is based on the linear approximation approach, but enhances it by introducing two key innovations: Trun-Eq based interval test protocols and linear approximation with dynamic precision, which have the potential for broader applicability. Furthermore, we classify common activation functions into several categories, and present specialized methods to evaluate them using our enhanced techniques. Our implementation of SEAF demonstrates $3.5 \\times$ to $5.9 \\times$ speedup on activation functions $\\mathsf{Tanh}$ and $\\mathsf{Sigmoid}$ compared to SirNN (S\\&P'21). When applied on $\\mathsf{GELU}$, SEAF outperforms Iron (NeurIPS'22) by more than $10 \\times$ and Bolt (S\\&P'24) by up to $3.4 \\times$. For end-to-end secure inference on BERT, the original $\\mathsf{GELU}$ accounts for $31.3 \\%$ and $22.5 \\%$ of the total runtime in Iron and Bolt, respectively. In contrast, our optimized $\\mathsf{GELU}$ reduces these proportions to  $4.3 \\%$ and $9.8 \\%$, eliminating $\\mathsf{GELU}$ as a bottleneck in secure inference.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in machine learning accuracy and utility have been driven by the effective combination of sophisticated models with high-performance computational scaling. As the development of large-scale models shifts away from commodity hardware to outsourced computation, it becomes paramount to ensure that the training process is executed with integrity and transparency. This encompasses verifying that adequate computational resources were expended and that the resulting model is accurate, rather than the product of skipped steps or resource-saving shortcuts by the external provider. Building on our previous efforts, which demonstrated the computational feasibility of using this system to argue correctness for differentially-private linear regression, we extend those results to achieve fully provable back-propagation\u2014a cornerstone operation in modern machine learning training. Our system achieves complete zero-knowledge, revealing nothing about the input data during training, and ensures quantum security by relying on no weak cryptographic primitives. Efficiency is substantially increased through the use of a fixed-point decimal representation, reducing the computational overhead typically associated with floating-point arithmetic. Notably, our solution is doubly efficient, achieving a logarithmic-time verifier and a linear-time prover. Implemented entirely in Rust without reliance on external machine learning libraries, and executed within a cryptographically secure virtual machine, this work represents a significant advancement toward verifiable, secure, and efficient outsourced machine learning computations.",

    "abstract": "Private set intersection (PSI) allows two participants to compute the intersection of their private sets without revealing any additional information beyond the intersection itself. It is known that oblivious linear evaluation (OLE) can be used to construct the online efficient PSI protocol (Kerschbaum \\textit{et al.}, NDSS'23).\r\nHowever, oblivious transfer (OT) and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)-based offline OLE generation are expensive, and the online computational complexity is super-linear and still a heavy burden for large-scale sets. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose VCR, an efficient PSI protocol from vector OLE (VOLE) with the offline-online paradigm. Concretely, we first propose the batched short VOLE protocol to reduce offline overhead for generating VOLE tuples. \r\nExperiments demonstrate that VCR outperforms prior art. Then, we design a batched private membership test protocol from pre-computed VOLE to accelerate the online computation. \r\nCompared to the previous work of Kerschbaum \\textit{et al.} (NDSS'23), we reduce the total communication costs (resp. running time) by $341\\times$ and $9.1\\times$ (resp. $6.5\\times$ and $2.5\\times$) on average for OT- and FHE-based protocols.",

    "abstract": "Throughput, i.e., the amount of payload data processed per unit of\r\n  time, is a crucial measure of scalability for blockchain consensus\r\n  mechanisms.  This paper revisits the design of secure,\r\n  high-throughput proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols in the\r\n  \\emph{permissionless} setting.  Existing high-throughput protocols\r\n  are either analyzed using overly simplified network models or are\r\n  designed for permissioned settings, with the task of adapting them\r\n  to a permissionless environment while maintaining both scalability\r\n  and adaptive security (which is essential in permissionless\r\n  environments) remaining an open question. \r\n\r\n  Two particular challenges arise when designing high-throughput\r\n  protocols in a permissionless setting: \\emph{message bursts}, where\r\n  the adversary simultaneously releases a large volume of withheld\r\n  protocol messages, and---in the PoS setting---\\emph{message\r\n    equivocations}, where the adversary diffuses arbitrarily many\r\n  versions of a protocol message.  It is essential for the security of\r\n  the ultimately deployed protocol that these issues be captured by\r\n  the network model.\r\n\r\n  Therefore, this work first introduces a new, realistic network model\r\n  based on the operation of real-world gossip networks---the standard\r\n  means of diffusion in permissionless systems, which may involve\r\n  many thousands of nodes.  The model specifically addresses challenges\r\n  such as message bursts and PoS equivocations and is also of\r\n  independent interest.\r\n\r\n  The second and main contribution of this paper is Leios, a\r\n  blockchain protocol that transforms any underlying low-throughput\r\n  base protocol into a blockchain achieving a throughput corresponding\r\n  to a $(1-\\delta)$-fraction of the network capacity---while affecting\r\n  latency only by a related constant.  In particular, if the\r\n  underlying protocol has constant expected settlement time, this\r\n  property is retained under the Leios overlay.  Combining Leios with\r\n  any permissionless protocol yields the first near-optimal throughput\r\n  permissionless ``layer-1'' blockchain protocol proven secure under\r\n  realistic network assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Protocols for State-Machine-Replication (sometimes called 'blockchain' protocols)  generally make use of rotating leaders to drive consensus. In typical protocols (henceforth called 'single-sender' protocols), the leader is a single processor responsible for making and disseminating proposals to others. Since the leader acts as a bottleneck, apparently limiting throughput, a recent line of research has investigated the use of 'multi-sender' protocols in which many processors distribute proposals in parallel. Examples include DAG-based protocols such as DAG-Rider, Bullshark, Sailfish, Cordial Miners, Mysticeti, and variants such as Autobahn. However, existing models do not allow for a formal analysis to determine whether these protocols can actually handle higher throughputs than single-sender protocols such as PBFT, Tendermint, and HotStuff.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we describe a very simple model that allows for such an analysis. For any given protocol, the model allows one to calculate latency as a function of  network bandwidth, network delays, the number of processors $n$, and the incoming transaction rate. Each protocol has a latency bottleneck: an incoming transaction rate at which latency becomes unbounded over the protocol execution, i.e., a maximum throughput that the protocol can handle without unbounded latency.  \r\n\r\nWith the aim of building to an analysis for state-of-the-art State-Machine-Replication (SMR) protocols, we begin by considering protocols for simpler primitives, such as Best-effort Broadcast and Reliable Broadcast. For Best-effort Broadcast, we establish a tight lower bound on latency for single-sender and multi-sender protocols when blocks are distributed without the use of techniques such as erasure coding. Perhaps unsurprisingly, a key difference between the single-sender and multi-sender approaches in this case is a factor $n$ in the point at which the latency bottleneck appears. However, for other primitives such as Reliable Broadcast,  our results may be more surprising: the factor $n$ difference now disappears, and maximum throughput for the two approaches differs by a constant factor, while multi-sender approaches will generally have latency that grows more quickly with $n$. For state-of-the-art SMR protocols, the picture that emerges is one with seemingly inherent trade-offs. If one compares single-sender protocols that use pipelining and erasure coding, such as DispersedSimplex, with DAG-based protocols such as Sailfish or Bullshark, the former are seen to have lower latency for a wide range of throughputs, while the benefit of the latter protocols is that they have  a latency bottleneck which is higher by a constant factor.",

    "abstract": "At the core of the fastest known SNARKs is the sum-check protocol. In this paper, we describe two complementary optimizations that significantly accelerate sum-check proving in key applications.\r\n\r\nThe first targets scenarios where polynomial evaluations involve small values, such as unsigned 32-bit integers or elements of small subfields within larger extension fields. This setting is common in applications such as Jolt, a state-of-the-art zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM) built on the sum-check protocol. Our core idea is to replace expensive multiplications over large fields with cheaper operations over smaller domains, yielding both asymptotic speedups and significant constant-factor improvements.\r\n\r\nThe second optimization addresses a common pattern where sum-check is applied to polynomials of the form $g(x) = \\mathsf{eq}(r, x) \\cdot p(x)$, where $\\mathsf{eq}$ is the multilinear extension of the equality function. We present a technique that substantially reduces the prover's cost associated with the equality polynomial component. We also describe how to combine both optimizations, which is essential for applications like Spartan within Jolt.\r\n\r\nWe have implemented and integrated our optimizations into the Jolt zkVM. Our benchmarks show consistent $2\\text{-}3\\times$ speedups for proving the first sum-check of Spartan within Jolt, with performance gains reaching 20$\\times$ or more when baseline methods approach their memory limits.",

    "abstract": "Although studied for several years now, parameter extraction of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has seen the major advances only in recent years. Carlini et al. (Crypto 2020) and Canales-Mart\u00ednez et al. (Eurocrypt 2024) showed how to extract the parameters of ReLU-based DNNs efficiently (polynomial time and polynomial number of queries, as a function on the number of neurons) in the raw-output setting, i.e., when the attacker has access to the raw output of the DNN. On the other hand, the more realistic hard-label setting gives the attacker access only to the most likely label after the DNN's raw output has been processed. Recently, Carlini et al. (Eurocrypt 2025) presented an efficient parameter extraction attack in the hard-label setting applicable to DNNs having a large number of parameters.\r\n\r\nThe work in Eurocrypt 2025 recovers the parameters of all layers except the output layer. The techniques presented there are not applicable to this layer due to its lack of ReLUs. In this work, we fill this gap and present a technique that allows recovery of the output layer. Additionally, we show parameter extraction methods that are more efficient when the DNN has contractive layers, i.e., when the number of neurons decreases in those layers. We successfully apply our methods to some networks trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Asymptotically, our methods have polynomial complexity in time and number of queries. Thus, a complete extraction attack combining the techniques by Carlini et al. and ours remains with polynomial complexity. Moreover, real execution time is decreased when attacking DNNs with the required contractive architecture.",

    "abstract": "One of the main shortcomings of classical distributed cryptography is its reliance on a certain fraction of participants remaining honest. Typically, honest parties are assumed to follow the protocol and not leak any information, even if behaving dishonestly would benefit them economically. More realistic models used in blockchain consensus rely on weaker assumptions, namely that no large coalition of corrupt parties exists, although every party can act selfishly. This is feasible since, in a consensus protocol, active misbehavior can be detected and \"punished\" by other parties. However, \"information leakage\", where an adversary reveals sensitive information via, e.g., a subliminal channel, is often impossible to detect and, hence, much more challenging to handle.\r\n\r\n    A recent approach to address this problem was proposed by Dziembowski, Faust, Lizurej, and Mielniczuk (ACM CCS 2024), who introduced a new notion called secret sharing with snitching. This primitive guarantees that as long as no large coalition of mutually trusting parties exists, every leakage of the shared secret produces a \"snitching proof\" indicating that some party participated in the illegal secret reconstruction. This holds in a very strong model, where mutually distrusting parties use an MPC protocol to reconstruct any information about the shared secret. Such a \"snitching proof\" can be sent to a smart contract (modeled as a \"judge\") deployed on the blockchain, which punishes the aving party financially.\r\n\r\n    In this paper, we extend the results from the work of CCS'24  by addressing its two main shortcomings. Firstly, we significantly strengthen the attack model by considering the case when mutually distrusting parties can also rely on a trusted third party (e.g., a smart contract). We call this new primitive strong secret sharing with snitching (SSSS). \r\n    We present an SSSS protocol that is secure in this model. Secondly, unlike in the construction from CCS'24, our protocol does not require the honest parties to perform any MPC computations on hash functions. Besides its theoretical interest, this improvement is of practical importance, as it allows the construction of SSSS from any (even very \"MPC-unfriendly\") hash function.",

    "abstract": "Traceable secret sharing complements traditional schemes by enabling the identification of parties who sell their shares. In the model introduced by Boneh, Partap, and Rotem [CRYPTO\u201924], a group of corrupted parties generates a reconstruction box $R$ that, given enough valid shares as input, reconstructs the secret. The goal is to trace $R$ back to at least one of the corrupted parties using only black-box access to it.\r\n\r\nWhile their work provides efficient constructions for threshold access structures, it does not apply to the general case. In this work, we extend their framework to general access structures and present the first traceable scheme supporting them.\r\n\r\nIn the course of our construction, we also contribute to the study of anonymous secret sharing, a notion recently introduced by Bishop et al. [CRYPTO\u201925], which strengthens classical secret sharing by requiring that shares do not reveal the identities of the parties holding them. We further advance this area by proposing new and stronger definitions, and presenting an anonymous scheme for general access structures that satisfies them.",

Although some general bounds are known, even for the relatively simple example of $n$-party AND, the exact complexity is unknown.\r\n\r\nWe improve the upper bound from Couteau and Ros\\'en in Asiacrypt 2022 on the (asymptotic) randomness complexity of $n$-party AND from 6 to 5 bits, that is, we give a $1$-private protocol for computing the AND of $n$ parties' inputs requiring $5$ bits of additional randomness, for all $n \\geq 120$. Our construction, like that of Couteau and Ros\\'en, requires a single source of randomness.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we consider the modified setting of Goyal, Ishai, and Song (Crypto '22) where helper parties without any inputs are allowed to assist in the computation. In this setting, we show that the randomness complexity of computing a general boolean circuit $C$ $1$-privately is exactly 2 bits, and this computation can be performed with seven helper parties per gate.",

    "abstract": "Inductive reasoning in form of hybrid arguments is prevalent in cryptographic security proofs, but they are not integrated into formalisms used to model cryptographic security proofs, such as, for example, state-separating proofs. In this paper we present an induction principle for hybrid arguments that says that two games are many-steps indistinguishable if they are, respectively, indistinguishable from the end points of an iterated one-step indistinguishability argument. We demonstrate how to implement this induction rule in Nominal-SSProve by taking advantage of the nominal character of state-variables and illustrate its versatility by proving a general reduction from many-time CPA-security to one-time CPA-security for any asymmetric encryption scheme. We\r\nthen specialize the result to ElGamal and reduce CPA-secure to the decisional Diffie Hellman-assumption.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the security of key derivation functions (KDFs), a central class of cryptographic algorithms used to derive multiple independent-looking keys (each associated with a particular context) from a single secret. The main security requirement is that these keys are pseudorandom (i.e., the KDF is a pseudorandom function). This paper initiates the study of an additional security property, called key control (KC) security, first informally put forward in a recent update to NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-108 standard for KDFs. Informally speaking, KC security demands that, given a known key, it is hard for an adversary to find a context that forces the KDF-derived key for that context to have a property that is specified a-priori and is hard to satisfy (e.g., that the derived key consists mostly of 0s, or that it is a weak key for a cryptographic algorithm using it).\r\nWe provide a rigorous security definition for KC security, and then move on to the analysis of the KDF constructions specified in NIST SP 800-108. We show, via security proofs in the random oracle model, that the proposed constructions based on XOFs or hash functions can accommodate for reasonable security margins (i.e., 128-bit security) when instantiated from KMAC and HMAC. We also show, via attacks, that all proposed block-cipher based modes of operation (while implementing mitigation techniques to prevent KC security attacks affecting earlier version of the standard) only achieve at best 72-bit KC security for 128-bit blocks, as with AES.",

    "abstract": "Anonymous cryptocurrencies attracted much attention over the past decade, yet ensuring both integrity and privacy in an open system remains challenging. Their transactions preserve privacy because they do not reveal on which earlier transaction they depend, specifically which outputs of previous transactions are spent. However, achieving privacy imposes a significant storage overhead due to two current limitations. First, the set of potentially unspent outputs of transactions grows indefinitely because the design hides cryptographically which one have been consumed; and, second, additional data must be stored for each spent output to ensure integrity, that is, to prevent that it can be spent again. We introduce a privacy-preserving payment scheme that mitigates these issues by randomly partitioning unspent outputs into fixed-size bins. Once a bin has been referenced in as many transactions as its size, it is pruned from the ledger. This approach reduces storage overhead while preserving privacy. We first highlight the scalability benefits of using smaller untraceability sets instead of considering the entire set of outputs, as done in several privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies. We then formalize the security and privacy notions required for a scalable, privacy-preserving payment system and analyze how randomized partitioning plays a key role in both untraceability and scalability. To instantiate our approach, we provide constructions based on Merkle trees and one based on cryptographic accumulators. We finally show the storage benefits of our scheme and analyze its resilience against large-scale flooding attacks using empirical transaction data.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the minimal assumptions necessary for constructing non-interactive zero-knowledge arguments (NIZKs) for NP and placing it within the hierarchy of cryptographic primitives has been a central goal in cryptography. Unfortunately, there are very few examples of ``generic'' constructions of NIZKs or any of its natural relaxations.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we consider the relaxation of NIZKs to the designated-verifier model (DV-NIZK) and present a new framework for  constructing (reusable) DV-NIZKs for NP generically from  lossy trapdoor functions and PRFs computable by polynomial-size branching programs (a class that includes NC1). Previous ``generic'' constructions  of DV-NIZK for NP from standard primitives relied either on (doubly-enhanced) trapdoor permutations or on a public-key encryption scheme plus a KDM-secure secret key encryption scheme.\r\n\r\nNotably, our DV-NIZK framework achieves statistical zero-knowledge. To our knowledge, this is the first DV-NIZK construction from any ``generic\" standard assumption with statistical zero-knowledge that does not already yield a NIZK. \r\n\r\nA key technical component of our construction is an efficient, unconditionally secure secret sharing scheme for non-monotone functions with randomness recovery for all polynomial-size branching programs. As an independent contribution we present an incomparable randomness recoverable (monotone) secret sharing for NC1 in a model with trusted setup that guarantees computational privacy assuming one-way functions. We believe that these primitives will be useful in related contexts in the future.",

    "abstract": "Given a sequence of $N$ independent sources $\\mathbf{X}_1,\\mathbf{X}_2,\\dots,\\mathbf{X}_N\\sim\\{0,1\\}^n$, how many of them must be good (i.e., contain some min-entropy) in order to extract a uniformly random string? This question was first raised by Chattopadhyay, Goodman, Goyal and Li (STOC '20), motivated by applications in cryptography, distributed computing, and the unreliable nature of real-world sources of randomness. In their paper, they showed how to construct explicit low-error extractors for just $K \\geq N^{1/2}$ good sources of polylogarithmic min-entropy. In a follow-up, Chattopadhyay and Goodman improved the number of good sources required to just $K \\geq N^{0.01}$ (FOCS '21). In this paper, we finally achieve $K=3$.\r\n\r\nOur key ingredient is a near-optimal explicit construction of a new pseudorandom primitive, called a leakage-resilient extractor (LRE) against number-on-forehead (NOF) protocols. Our LRE can be viewed as a significantly more robust version of Li's low-error three-source extractor (FOCS '15), and resolves an open question put forth by Kumar, Meka, and Sahai (FOCS '19) and Chattopadhyay, Goodman, Goyal, Kumar, Li, Meka, and Zuckerman (FOCS '20). Our LRE construction is based on a simple new connection we discover between multiparty communication complexity and non-malleable extractors, which shows that such extractors exhibit strong average-case lower bounds against NOF protocols.",

    "abstract": "At CRYPTO 2020, Dachman-Soled et al. introduced a framework for to analyze the security loss of Learning with Errors LWE, which enables the incremental integration of leaked hints into lattice-based attacks. Later  Nowakowski and May at ASIACRYPT 2023 proposed a novel method capable of integrating and combining an arbitrary number of both perfect and modular hints for the  LWE secret within a unified framework, which achieves better efficiency in constructing the lattice basis and makes the attacks more practical. In this paper, we first consider solving LWE with independent hints about both the secret and errors. Firstly, we introduce a novel approach to embed the hints for secret into the LWE lattice by just matrix multiplication instead of the  LLL reduction as in Nowakowski and May's attack, which further reduces the time complexity to construct the lattice basis. For example, given 234 perfect hints about CRYSTALS-KYBER 512, our method reduces the running time from 3 hours to 0.35 hours. Secondly, we show how to embed the hints about errors to the obtained lattice basis.",

    "abstract": "Indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) turns a program unintelligible without altering its functionality and is a powerful cryptographic primitive that captures the power of most known primitives. Recent breakthroughs have successfully constructed iO from well-founded computational assumptions, yet these constructions are unfortunately insecure against quantum adversaries. In the search of post-quantum secure iO, a line of research investigates constructions from fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and tailored decryption hint release mechanisms. Proposals in this line mainly differ in their designs of decryption hints, yet all known attempts either cannot be proven from a self-contained computational assumption, or are based on novel lattice assumptions which are subsequently cryptanalysed.  \r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose a new plausibly post-quantum secure construction of iO by designing a new mechanism for releasing decryption hints. Unlike prior attempts, our decryption hints follow a public Gaussian distribution subject to decryption correctness constraints and are therefore in a sense as random as they could be. To generate such hints efficiently, we develop a general-purpose tool called primal lattice trapdoors, which allow sampling trapdoored matrices whose Learning with Errors (LWE) secret can be equivocated. We prove the security of our primal lattice trapdoors construction from the NTRU assumption. The security of the iO construction is then argued, along with other standard lattice assumptions, via a new Equivocal LWE assumption, for which we provide evidence for plausibility and identify potential targets for further cryptanalysis.",

    "abstract": "Side-channel attacks are increasingly recognized as a significant threat to hardware roots of trust. As a result, cryptographic module designers must ensure that their modules are resilient to such attacks before deployment. However, efficient evaluation of side-channel vulnerabilities in cryptographic implementations remains challenging. This paper introduces an open-source framework integrating FPGA designs, power measurement tools, and high-performance side-channel analysis libraries to streamline the evaluation process. The framework provides design templates for two widely used FPGA boards in the side-channel analysis community, enabling Shell-Role architecture, a modern FPGA design pattern. This shell abstraction allows designers to focus on developing cryptographic modules while utilizing standardized software tools for hardware control and power trace acquisition. Additionally, the framework includes acceleration plugins for ChipWhisperer, the leading open-source side-channel analysis platform, to enhance the performance of correlation power analysis (CPA) attacks. These plugins exploit modern many-core processors and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to speed up analysis significantly. To showcase the capabilities of the proposed framework, we conducted multiple case studies and highlighted significant findings that advance side-channel research. Furthermore, we compare our CPA plugins with existing tools and show that our plugins achieve up to 8.60x speedup over the state-of-the-art CPA tools.",

    "abstract": "FHE-based private information retrieval (PIR) is widely used to maintain the secrecy of the client queries in a client-server architecture. There are several ways to implement FHE-based PIR. Most of these approaches results in server computation overhead. Attempts for reducing the server computation overhead results in  1) fetching incorrect results, 2) leakage of queries, 3) large number of homomorphic operations (which is a time consuming process), and 4) downloading the entire dataset in the client side. In this work, we design a three server based approach where the first server discuss the nature of dataset, second server stores the computation results performed over first server, and third server stores the dataset in accordance to the proposed novel technique, that is, restricted bin packing algorithm (RBA). The proposed three server based approach optimise the aforementioned limitations. Later we implement the designed protocol using Tenseal library. Our protocol provides to retrieve the data by providing security to the client's query.",

    "abstract": "A multi-designated verifier signature (MDVS) is a digital signature that empowers a signer to designate specific verifiers capable of verifying signatures. Notably, designated verifiers are allowed to not only verify signatures but also simulate \u201cfake\u201d signatures indistinguishable from real ones produced by the original signer. Since this property is useful for realizing off-the-record (i.e., deniable) communication in group settings, MDVS is attracting attention in secure messaging. Recently, Damg\u00e5rd et al. (TCC\u201920) and Chakraborty et al. (EUROCRYPT\u201923) have introduced new MDVS schemes, allowing a subset of designated verifiers to simulate signatures in contrast to the conventional one, which requires all designated verifiers for signature simulation. They also define a stronger notion of security for them. This work delves into this new MDVS and offers a comprehensive formalization. We identify all possible security levels of MDVS schemes in subset simulations and prove that some of them are not feasible. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MDVS schemes meeting the security notion defined by Chakraborty et al. imply IND-CCA secure public-key encryption schemes. Beyond formalization, we present new constructions of MDVS schemes in subset simulation. Notably, we introduce a new construction of strongly secure MDVS schemes based on ring signatures and public-key encryption, accompanied by a generic conversion for achieving consistency through non-interactive zero-knowledge arguments. Finally, we evaluate the efficiency of our MDVS schemes in classical and post-quantum settings, showing their practicality.",

    "abstract": "This note gives an explanation for a phenomenon which appeared in the cryptanalysis of the Elisabeth-4 stream cipher, a stream cipher optimized for Torus Fully Homomorphic Encryption (TFHE). This primitive was broken in 2023 by a linearization attack. The authors of this attack made an observation on the rank of the linear system they generated, which was lower than expected. They have provided a partial explanation for it using some properties of the negacyclic lookup tables (NLUT), one of the potential building block of the ciphers optimized for TFHE. NLUTs are defined as functions over integers modulo 2^n such that for all x, L(x + 2^(n\u22121) ) = \u2212L(x). Their explanation of the rank defect of the linear system relies on the observation that the least significant bit of L(x) does not depend on the most significant bit of x, which prevents some monomials from appearing in the algebraic normal form (ANF) of the system. In this note, we prove a stronger property of the ANF of NLUTs and use it to give full proof of their observation on the rank of the system.",

    "abstract": "The benefits of using Deep Learning techniques to enhance side-channel attacks performances have been demonstrated over recent years. \r\nMost of the work carried out since then focuses on discriminative models.\r\nHowever, one of their major limitations is the lack of theoretical results.\r\nIndeed, this lack of theoretical results, especially concerning the choice of neural network architecture to consider or the loss to prioritize to build an optimal model, can be problematic for both attackers and evaluators. \r\nRecently, Zaid et al. addressed this problem by proposing a generative model that bridges conventional profiled attacks and deep learning techniques, thus providing a model that is both explicable and interpretable. \r\nNevertheless the proposed model has several limitations. \r\nIndeed, the architecture is too complex, higher-order attacks cannot be mounted and desynchronization is not handled by this model. \r\nIn this paper, we address the first limitation namely the architecture complexity, as without a simpler model, the other limitations cannot be treated properly.\r\nTo do so, we propose a new generative model that relies on solid theoretical results. \r\nThis model is based on conditional variational autoencoder and converges towards the optimal statistical model i.e. it performs an optimal attack.\r\nBy building on and extending the state-of-the-art theoretical works on dimensionality reduction, we integrate into this neural network an optimal dimensionality reduction i.e. a dimensionality reduction that is achieved without any loss of information.\r\nThis results in a gain of $\\mathcal{O}(D)$, with $D$ the dimension of traces, compared to Zaid et al. neural network in terms of architecture complexity, while at the same time enhancing the explainability and interpretability.\r\nIn addition, we propose a new attack strategy based on our neural network, which reduces the attack complexity of generative models from $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, with $N$ the number of generated traces. \r\nWe validate all our theoretical results experimentally using extensive simulations and various publicly available datasets covering symmetric, asymmetric pre and post-quantum cryptography implementations.",

In some cases, the proposals came without an indepth analysis allowing to understand the tool, its applicability scenarios, its limitations and the advantages it brings with respect to classical statistical tools. As an example, a study presented at CHES 2021 proposed a corrective iterative framework to perform an unsupervised attack which achieves a 100% key bits recovery. \r\nIn this paper we analyze the iterative framework and the datasets it was applied onto. The analysis suggests a much easier and interpretable way to both implement such an iterative framework and perform the attack using more conventional solutions, without affecting the attack\u2019s performances.",

    "abstract": "The Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem has become a cornerstone for building lightweight, post-quantum secure encryption schemes. Despite its widespread adoption, LPN-based constructions suffer from a fundamental efficiency limitation: the essential noise term that provides security simultaneously requires error correction coding, leading to bandwidth overhead. We introduce a variant of LPN termed Learning Parity with Quantization (LPQ). While maintaining the ``learning from noisy equations'' framework, LPQ generates Bernoulli-like noise from code-aided quantization and enables simultaneous security and compression. Formally, the $\\text{LPQ}_{N,n,\\mathcal{C}}$ problem challenges adversaries to distinguish the triplet $(\\mathbf{A}, Q_{\\mathcal{C}}(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{s} \\oplus \\mathbf{u}), \\mathbf{u})$ from uniform, where  $Q_{\\mathcal{C}}$ is a vector quantization function based on an $(N,K)$ code $\\mathcal{C}$, and   $\\mathbf{u}$ serves as a public dither. We establish the hardness of LPQ through  a tight reduction from the LPN problem, maintaining equivalent security guarantees. We demonstrate LPQ\u2019s practical efficacy through a full rate (i.e., rate-1) symmetric key encryption scheme, where LPQ combined with an extendable output function (XOF) achieves optimal ciphertext efficiency ($|\\text{ct}| = |\\text{pt}|$).",

    "abstract": "Multivariate public key cryptosystems represent a promising family of post-quantum cryptographic schemes. Extensive research has demonstrated that multivariate polynomials are particularly well-suited for constructing digital signature schemes. Notably, the Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar (UOV) signature scheme and its variants have emerged as leading candidates in NIST's recent call for additional digital signature proposals. \r\n  Security analysis against UOV variants are typically categorized into key-recovery attacks and forgery attacks, with the XL algorithm serving as one of the most significant methods for mounting key-recovery attacks. Recently, Lars Ran introduced a new attack against UOV variants that could be seen as an XL attack using exterior algebra; nevertheless, this new attacking algorithm is applicable only when the underlying (finite) field of the UOV variant is of characteristic $2$. \r\n  In this work, we address this limitation by proposing a unified framework. Specifically, we first propose the notion of reduced symmetric algebra over any field, whose strength can be gleaned from the fact that it is essentially symmetric algebra when the characteristic $p$ of the underlying field is $0$ and is exterior algebra when $p=2$. Based upon the reduced symmetric algebra, we then propose a new XL attack against all UOV variants. Our XL attack is equivalent to Lars Ran's one for those UOV variants whose underlying fields are of characteristic $p=2$; more importantly, our XL attack can also be applied to analyze those UOV variants with odd characteristic, such as QR-UOV submitted to NIST's PQC Standardization Project. It should be noted that in regard to those 12 QR-UOV recommended instances, our XL attack does not outperform existing key-recovery counterparts; nevertheless, it is the optimal key-recovery attack for some specific UOV instances with odd characteristic.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces ZK-NR, a modular cryptographic protocol designed to ensure privacy-preserving non-repudiation in the co-production of digital public services. By integrating Merkle commitments, zero-knowledge proofs (STARKs), threshold BLS signatures, and post-quantum Dilithium authentication, ZK-NR enables the creation of secure, verifiable, and auditable evidence across decentralized infrastructures. Unlike traditional digital signatures or blockchain-based logs, ZK-NR provides formally verifiable attestations without disclosing sensitive content, making it suitable for public finance, e-government, and regulated digital ecosystems. The protocol is modeled in Tamarin and implemented as a proof-of-concept using open cryptographic tools. This contribution offers a reproducible foundation for future infrastructures requiring long-term trust, data minimization, and legal admissibility, particularly in contexts where citizens and institutions share responsibility for digital evidence. ZK-NR addresses the tension between confidentiality and accountability, providing an interoperable and future-ready layer for trustworthy public service delivery.\r\nThis preliminary work focuses on architectural composition and implementation feasibility. It does not include formal security proofs.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the first generic compiler that transforms any permissioned consensus protocol into a proof-of-stake permissionless consensus protocol. For each of the following properties, if the initial permissioned protocol satisfies that property in the partially synchronous setting, the consequent proof-of-stake protocol also satisfies that property in the partially synchronous and quasi-permissionless setting (with the same fault-tolerance): consistency; liveness; optimistic responsiveness; every composable log-specific property; and message complexity of a given order. Moreover, our transformation ensures that the output protocol satisfies accountability (identifying culprits in the event of a consistency violation), whether or not the original permissioned protocol satisfied it.",

    "abstract": "One-Time Pad (OTP), introduced by Shannon, is well-known as an unconditionally secure encryption algorithm and has become the cornerstone of modern cryptography. However, the unconditional security of OTP applies solely to confidentiality and does not extend to integrity. Hash functions such as SHA2, SHA3 or SM3 applies only to integrity but not to confidentiality and also can not obtain unconditional security. Encryption and digital signatures based on asymmetric cryptography can provide confidentiality, integrity and authentication, but they can only achieve computational security. Leveraging the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics\uff0cQuantum key distribution\uff08QKD\uff09can achieve unconditional security in theory. However, due to limitations in eavesdropping detection, the use of classical channels and imperfections in quantum devices, it cannot reach unconditional security in practical applications. In this paper, based on  polynomial rings and the theory of probability, we propose an unconditionally secure encryption algorithm with unified confidentiality and integrity. The main calculation of the  encryption algorithm is  Cyclic Redundancy Check(CRC).  Theoretical analysis proves that the encryption algorithm not only meets the unconditional security of confidentiality, but also guarantees the unconditional security of integrity, especially suitable for high-security communications such as finance, military, government and other fields.",

    "abstract": "In many fields, the need to securely collect and aggregate data from distributed systems is growing. However, designs that rely solely on encrypted data transmission make it difficult to trace malicious users. To address this challenge, we have enhanced the secure aggregation (SA) protocol proposed by Bell et al. (CCS 2020) by introducing verification features that ensure compliance with user inputs and encryption processes while preserving data privacy. We present LZKSA, a quantum-safe secure aggregation system with input verification. LZKSA employs seven zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) protocols based on the Ring Learning with Errors problem, specifically designed for secure aggregation. These protocols verify whether users have correctly used SA keys and their $L_{\\infty}$, $L_2$ norms and cosine similarity of data, meet specified constraints, to exclude malicious users from current and future aggregation processes. The specialized ZKPs we propose significantly enhance proof efficiency. In practical federated learning scenarios, our experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proof generation time for $L_{\\infty}$ and $L_2$ constraints is reduced to about $10^{-3}$ of that required by the current state-of-the-art method, RoFL (S\\&P 2023), and ACORN (USENIX 2023). For example, the proof generation/verification time of RoFL, ACORN and LZKSA for $L_{\\infty}$ is 94s/29.9s, 78.7s/33.9s, and 0.02s/0.0062s for CIFAR10, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar construction (UOV) has been the backbone of multivariate cryptography since the fall of HFE-based schemes. In fact, 7 UOV-based schemes have been submitted to the NIST additional call for signatures, and 4 of these made it to the second round. For efficiency considerations, most of these schemes are defined over a field of characteristic 2. This has as a side effect that the polar forms of the UOV public maps are not only symmetric, but also alternating.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose a new key-recovery attack on UOV in characteristic 2 that makes use of this property. We consider the polar forms of the UOV public maps as elements of the exterior algebra. We show that these are contained in a certain subspace of the second exterior power that is dependent on the oil space. This allows us to define relations between the polar forms and the image of the dual of the oil space under the Pl\u00fccker embedding. With this, we can recover the secret oil space using sparse linear algebra.\r\n\r\nThis new attack has an improved complexity over previous methods and reduces the security by 4, 11, and 20 bits for uov-Ip, uov-III, and uov-V, respectively. Furthermore, the attack is applicable to MAYO$_2$ and improves on the best attack by 28 bits.",

    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a key technology to enable privacy-preserving computation. While optimized FHE implementations already exist, the inner workings of FHE are technically complex. This makes it challenging, especially for non-experts, to develop highly-efficient FHE programs that can exploit the advanced hardware of today. Although several compilers have emerged to help in this process, due to design choices, they are limited in terms of application support and the efficiency levels they can achieve.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we showcase how to make FHE accessible to non-expert developers while retaining the performance provided by an expert-level implementation. We introduce Parasol, a novel end-to-end compiler encompassing a virtual processor with a custom Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and a low-level library that implements FHE operations. Our processor integrates with existing compiler toolchains, thereby providing mainstream language support. We extract parallelism at multiple levels via our processor design and its computing paradigm. Specifically, we champion a Circuit Bootstrapping (CBS)-based paradigm, enabling efficient FHE circuit composition with multiplexers. Furthermore, Parasol\u2019s underlying design highlights the benefits of expressing FHE computations at a higher level\u2014producing highly compact program representations. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of Parasol, in terms of runtime (up to 17x faster), program size (up to 22x smaller), and compile time (up to 32x shorter) compared to the current state-of-the-art. We expect the FHE computing paradigm underlying Parasol to attract future interest since it exposes added parallelism for FHE accelerators to exploit.",

    "abstract": "Group Signatures are fundamental cryptographic primitives that allow users to sign a message on behalf of a predefined set of users, curated by the group manager. The security properties ensure that members of the group can sign anonymously and without fear of being framed. In dynamic group signatures, the group manager has finer-grained control over group updates while ensuring membership privacy (i.e., hiding when users join and leave). The only known scheme that achieves standard security properties and membership privacy has been proposed by Backes et al. CCS 2019. However, they rely on an inefficient revocation mechanism that re-issues credentials to all active members during every group update, and users have to rely on a secure and private channel to join the group.\r\nIn this paper, we introduce a dynamic group signature that supports verifier-local revocation, while achieving strong security properties, including membership privacy for users joining over a public channel. Moreover, when our scheme is paired with structure-preserving signatures over equivalence class it enjoys a smaller signature size compared to Backes et al. Finally, as a stand-alone contribution we extend the primitive Asynchronous Remote Key Generation (Frymann et al. CCS 2020) with trapdoors and introduce new security properties to capture this new functionality, which is fundamental to the design of our revocation mechanism",

    "abstract": "Decentralized e-voting enables secure and transparent elections without relying on trusted authorities, with blockchain emerging as a popular platform. It has compelling applications in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), where governance relies on voting with blockchain-issued tokens. Quadratic voting (QV), a mechanism that mitigates the dominance of large token holders, has been adopted by many DAO elections to enhance fairness. However, current QV systems deployed in practice publish voters' choices in plaintext with digital signatures. The open nature of all ballots comprises voter privacy, potentially affecting voters' honest participation. Prior research proposes using cryptographic techniques to encrypt QV ballots, but they work in a centralized setting, relying on a trusted group of tallying authorities to administrate an election. However, in DAO voting, there is no trusted third party.   \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose QV Network (QV-net), the first decentralized quadratic voting scheme, in which voters do not need to trust any third party other than themselves for ballot secrecy. QV-net is self-tallying with maximal ballot secrecy. Self-tallying allows anyone to compute election results once all ballots are cast. Maximal ballot secrecy ensures that what each voter learns from QV-net is nothing more than the tally and their own ballot. We provide an open-source implementation of QV-net to demonstrate its practicality based on real-world DAO voting settings, reporting only a few milliseconds for voting and a maximum of 255 milliseconds for tallying.\r\n\r\nThe exceptional efficiency of QV-net is attributed to the design of two new Zero-Knowledge Argument of Knowledge (ZKAoK) protocols for QV ballot secrecy and integrity. Previous works generally rely on pairing-friendly curves to prove the well-formedness of an encrypted QV ballot. But they incur heavy computation and large data sizes. We tackle the challenges of appropriately formalizing and proving ZKAoK relations for QV without using these curves. Specifically, we develop a succinct ZKAoK to prove a new relation: the sum of squares of a private vector's components equals a private scalar. We also introduce the first aggregated range proof to prove that values committed under different keys fall within their respective ranges. Together, these two new zero-knowledge protocols enable us to build an efficient decentralized QV scheme and are of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Privacy is a growing concern for smart contracts on public ledgers. \r\nIn recent years, we have seen several practical systems for privacy-preserving smart contracts, but they only target privacy of on-chain data, and rely on trusted off-chain parties with user data -- for instance, a decentralized finance application (e.g. exchange) relies on an off-chain matching engine to process client orders that get settled on-chain, where privacy only applies to the on-chain data.\r\nPrivacy conscious users demand stronger notions of privacy, for their identity and their data, from all other parties in the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nWe propose a novel framework for smart contracts that ensures {\\em doubly private}\r\nexecution, addressing {both on-chain and off-chain privacy} requirements. \r\nIn our framework, clients submit their requests in a privacy-preserving manner to a group of (potentially mutually untrusting) servers. These servers collaboratively match client requests without learning any information about the data or identities of the clients.\r\n\r\nWe then present {\\em Jigsaw}, an efficient cryptographic realization of our proposed framework. {\\em Jigsaw} builds on the ZEXE architecture (Bowe et al., S\\&P 2020), which leverages zkSNARKs, and extends Collaborative zkSNARKs (Ozdemir and Boneh, USENIX 2022) to enable proof generation by a group of servers.\r\n\r\nIn Jigsaw, we introduce a novel collaborative zkSNARK construction that achieves low latency and reduced proving time, and showcase these advantages over sample applications ranging from trading in a decentralized exchange to auctions and voting.\r\nOur experiments demonstrate that {\\em Jigsaw} is roughly $40-50$x faster in proof generation and uses orders-of-magnitude less bandwidth than the naive approach of using off-the-shelf Collaborative zkSNARKs.",

    "abstract": "Observing the growing popularity of random permutation (RP)-based designs (e.g, Sponge), Bart Mennink in CRYPTO 2019 has initiated an interesting research in the direction of RP-based pseudorandom functions (PRFs). Both are claimed to achieve beyond-the-birthday-bound  (BBB) security of $2n/3$ bits ($n$ being the input block size in bits) but require two instances of RPs and can handle only one-block inputs. In this work, we extend research in this direction by providing two new BBB-secure constructions by composing the tweakable Even-Mansour appropriately.  Our first construction requires only one instance of an RP and requires only one key.  Our second construction extends the first to a nonce-based  Message Authentication Code (MAC) using a universal hash to deal with multi-block inputs.  We show that the hash key can be derived from the original key when the underlying hash is the Polyhash. We provide matching attacks for both constructions to demonstrate the tightness of the proven security bounds.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an improvement to the McEliece encryption scheme by replacing the Goppa code with a  $(U+V,U+W)$ code. Specifically, we embed the generator matrices of a split Reed-Solomon code into the generator matrix of the $(U+V,U+W)$ code. This approach disrupts the algebraic structure of Reed-Solomon codes, thereby enhancing resistance against structural attacks targeting such codes, while simultaneously preserving their excellent error-correcting capabilities. As a result, the proposed scheme achieves a significant reduction in public key size. Under the hardness assumptions of the decoding problem and the code distinguishing problem for $(U+V,U+W)$ codes, we prove that the scheme achieves indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attacks (IND-CPA security). Finally, we provide recommended parameters for various security levels and compare the proposed scheme with other code-based public key encryption schemes.",

    "abstract": "Sorting encrypted values is an open research problem that plays a crucial role in the broader objective of providing efficient and practical privacy-preserving online services. \r\nThe current state of the art work by Mazzone, Everts, Hahn and Peter (USENIX Security '25) proposes efficient algorithms for ranking, indexing and sorting based on the CKKS scheme, which deviates from the compare-and-swap paradigm, typically used by sorting networks, using a permutation-based approach. This allows to build shallow sorting circuits in a very simple way.\r\nIn this work, we follow up their work and explore different approaches to approximate the nonlinear functions required by the encrypted circuit (where only additions and multiplications can be evaluated), and we propose simpler solutions that allow for faster computations and smaller memory requirements. \r\n\r\nIn particular, we drastically reduce the upper bound on the depth of the circuits from 65 to 20, making our circuits usable in relatively small rings such as $N=2^{16}$, even for sorting values while preserving up to three decimal places. As an example, our circuit sorts 128 values with duplicates in roughly 20 seconds on a laptop, using roughly 1 GB of memory, maintaining a precision of 0.01.\r\nFurthermore, we propose an implementation of a swap-based bitonic network that is not based on approximations of the sgn$(x)$ function, which scales linearly with the number of values, useful when the number of available slots is small.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel technique for verifying Schnorr signatures using fast endomorphisms. Traditionally, fast endomorphisms over prime field curves are used to decompose a scalar into two scalars of half of the size. This work shows that the context of the verification of signatures allows for the decomposition into three scalars of a third of the size. We apply our technique to three scenarios: verification of a single Schnorr signature, batch verification, and verification of BLS signatures within the Blind Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. Our experiments on AMD x86 and ARM Cortex-M4 platforms show performance improvements of approximately 20%, 13%, and 27%, respectively. The technique can also be used to accelerate the verification of ECDSA signatures, provided that one additional bit of information is appended to the signature.\r\n\r\nAs part of our work, we analyze the performance of 3-dimensional lattice reduction algorithms, which are critical for multi-scalar decompositions. To identify the most efficient approach, we experimentally compare Semaev\u2019s algorithm --- known for its best asymptotic complexity --- with the simpler Lagrange\u2019s algorithm. Our results reveal that, despite its simplicity, Lagrange\u2019s algorithm is nearly twice as fast as Semaev\u2019s in practice.",

    "abstract": "Program verification ensures software correctness through formal methods but incurs substantial computational overhead. It typically encodes program execution into formulas that are verified using a SAT solver and its extensions. However, this process exposes sensitive program details and requires redundant computations when multiple parties need to verify correctness. To overcome these limitations, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) generate compact, reusable proofs with fast verification times, while provably hiding the program\u2019s internal logic. We propose a two-phase zero-knowledge protocol that hides program implementation details throughout verification. Phase I uses a zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM) to encode programs into SAT formulas without\r\nrevealing their semantics. Phase II employs the encoding of resolution proofs for UNSAT instances and circuits for satisfying assignment verification for SAT instances through PLONKish circuits. Evaluation on the Boolector benchmark demonstrates that our method achieves verification time that is efficient and is independent of clause width for UNSAT instances and formula size for SAT instances. The resulting ZKPs enable efficient verification of program properties while providing strong end-to-end privacy guarantees.",

    "abstract": "In many areas of cybersecurity, we require access to Personally Identifiable Information (PII), such as names, postal addresses and email addresses. Unfortunately, this can lead to data breaches, especially in relation to data compliance regulations such as GDPR. An Internet Protocol (IP) address is an identifier that is assigned to a networked device to enable it to communicate over networks that use IP. Thus, in applications which are privacy-aware, we may aim to hide the IP address while aiming to determine if the address comes from a blacklist. One solution to this is to use homomorphic encryption to match an encrypted version of an IP address to a blacklisted network list. This matching allows us to encrypt the IP address and match it to an encrypted version of a blacklist. In this paper, we use the OpenFHE library \\cite{OpenFHE} to encrypt network addresses with the BFV homomorphic encryption scheme. In order to assess the performance overhead of BFV, we implement a matching method using the OpenFHE library and compare it against partial homomorphic schemes, including Paillier, Damgard-Jurik, Okamoto-Uchiyama, Naccache-Stern and Benaloh. The main findings are that the BFV method compares favourably against the partial homomorphic methods in most cases.",

    "abstract": "We present several new algorithms to evaluate modular polynomials of level $\\ell$ modulo a prime $p$ on an input $j$. \r\n    More precisely, we introduce two new generic algorithms, sharing the following similarities: they are based on a CRT approach; they make use of supersingular curves and the Deuring correspondence; and, their memory requirements are optimal. \r\n\r\n    The first algorithm combines the ideas behind a hybrid algorithm of Sutherland in 2013 with a recent algorithm to compute modular polynomials using supersingular curves introduced in 2023 by Leroux. The complexity (holding around several plausible heuristic assumptions) of the resulting algorithm matches the $O(\\ell^3 \\log^{3} \\ell + \\ell \\log p)$ time complexity of the best known algorithm by Sutherland, but has an optimal memory requirement.    \r\n    \r\n    Our second algorithm is based on a sub-algorithm that can evaluate modular polynomials efficiently on supersingular $j$-invariants defined over $\\mathbb{F}_p$, and achieves heuristic complexity quadratic in both $\\ell$ and $\\log j$, and linear in $\\log p$. In particular, it is the first generic algorithm with optimal memory requirement to obtain a quadratic complexity in~$\\ell$. \r\n    \r\n    Additionally, we show how to adapt our method to the computation of other types of modular polynomials such as the one stemming from Weber's function.  \r\n    \r\n    Finally, we provide an optimised implementation of the two algorithms detailed in this paper, though we emphasise that various modules in our codebase\r\n    may find applications outside their use in this paper.",

    "abstract": "We propose a dimension-reducing transformation on Group Ring Learning with Errors (GRLWE) samples. We exhibit an efficiently computable isomorphism which takes samples defined over the group rings used in the construction of GRLWE to twice as many samples defined over matrix rings, in half the dimension. This is done by composing two maps: the first map is a transformation showing that the group rings used are orders in central simple algebras, and the second map takes the obtained central simple algebra to a matrix ring. When combined with lattice reduction on the resulting matrix samples, this gives an attack on the GRLWE problem. We extend this attack to other groups proposed for cryptographic use by the creators of GRLWE, and display some numerical results quantifying the effects of the transformation, using the `Lattice Estimator'. We then give a family of groups from which GRLWE-style group rings can be constructed which are immune to our attack, namely the generalized quaternion groups. Finally, we discuss the merits and vulnerabilities of a number of different forms of structured LWE.",

    "abstract": "Randomness extractors are algorithms that distill weak random sources into near-perfect random numbers. Two-source extractors enable this distillation process by combining two independent weak random sources. Raz\u2019s extractor (STOC '05) was the first to achieve this in a setting where one source has linear min-entropy (i.e., proportional to its length), while the other has only logarithmic min-entropy in its length. However, Raz's original construction is impractical due to a polynomial computation time of at least degree 4. Our work solves this problem by presenting an improved version of Raz's extractor with quasi-linear computation time, as well as a new analytic theorem with reduced entropy requirements. We provide comprehensive analytical and numerical comparisons of our construction with others in the literature, and we derive strong and quantum-proof versions of our efficient Raz extractor. Additionally, we offer an easy-to-use, open-source code implementation of the extractor and a numerical parameter calculation module.",

    "abstract": "Based on a sharpening of Carmichael\u2019s theorem and Euler\u2019s theorem we generalize RSA and CRT-RSA to arbitrary integer moduli $n > 1$, while restricting messages to integers $m$ which are regular modulo $n$, meaning that they have a John-von-Neumann pseudoinverse modulo $n$. We prove the correctness and completeness of our encryption and decryption method for this class of messages, and show that the restriction to regular integers is negligible, since under reasonable assumptions almost all integers are regular modulo $n$.",

    "abstract": "A holy grail in blockchain infrastructure is a trustless bridge between Bitcoin and its second layers or other chains. We make progress toward this vision by introducing the first light-client based Bitcoin bridge. At the heart of its design lies BitVM2-core, a novel paradigm that enables arbitrary program execution on Bitcoin, combining Turing-complete expressiveness with the security of Bitcoin consensus. BitVM2-bridge advances prior approaches by reducing the trust assumption from an honest majority (t-of-n) to existential honesty (1-of-n) during setup. Liveness is guaranteed with only one rational operator, and any user can act as a challenger, enabling permissionless verification. A production-level implementation of BitVM2 has been developed and a full challenge verification has been executed on the Bitcoin mainnet.",

    "abstract": "Authenticated dictionaries (ADs) enable secure lookups to a dictionary hosted by an untrusted server and are a key component of various real-world applications, including transparency systems and cryptocurrencies. Despite significant overlap in techniques for building ADs and related primitives, such as memory checkers and accumulators (i.e., authenticated sets), these relationships have yet to be formalized.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we give a rigorous treatment of ADs and prove their precise connection to the latter two cornerstone primitives. We start by laying out the minimal algorithms and security properties needed in practice and introduce a new security notion for ADs called write-committing, which requires update proofs to guarantee an exact count of changes.\r\n\r\nWe prove that any AD built from a black-box authenticated set (AS) makes at least $\\Omega(\\log n)$ AS calls per lookup and obeys a trade-off between lookups and updates. With optimal lookups, such a scheme requires at least $\\Omega(\\log n/\\log\\log n)$ AS calls per update. \r\nWe also resolve the open question of constructing a secure AD from only black-box access to an AS and present two schemes adhering to the trade-off: one with optimal lookup overhead and the other with higher lookup complexity, but which only requires two AS calls for an update. \r\n\r\nFinally, we make strides towards unifying memory checkers and ADs. To this end, we present two constructions for memory checkers with black-box access to an AD: one that incurs constant overhead (but needs write-committing) and a second that only requires the AD to be lookup-secure but incurs logarithmic overhead. We then give a simple AD construction using a memory checker as a black-box, with $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ overhead. \r\n\r\nOur results demonstrate the inherent limitations of ADs built from accumulators but lay the foundation for extending existing results on memory checkers and other primitives, such as vector commitments, to ADs.",

    "abstract": "A significant effort in designing and engineering post-quantum cryptosystems is currently ongoing, also as a result of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Post-quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization process that started in 2016 and recently completed selecting two Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs), CRYSTALS-Kyber and HQC, and three digital signatures CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Falcon, and SPHINCS+ for standardization. In 2022, NIST launched another standardization effort for additional post-quantum digital signatures, preferably not based on the security assumptions of structured lattices, and with performance better than or equal to that of already standardized schemes (e.g., SPHINCS+ ). This initiative has narrowed down the initial 40 candidates to 14 in October 2024, eliciting public scrutiny of their algorithms and technical evaluation of their performance figures. Among the schemes admitted to the second round of  evaluation, the code-based CROSS signature scheme was praised for its speed and the noticeably smaller signature sizes over the standardized version of SPHINCS+ . In this work, we present the first RTL hardware design of CROSS tailored for FPGA devices, delineating efficient implementation strategies for the critical components of the cryptographic scheme. Depending on the chosen security level, our design generates a key pair in 9 to 152 \u00b5s, signs a message in 404 \u00b5s to 5.89 ms, and verifies a signature in 322 \u00b5s to 4.38 ms on the NIST reference FPGA, a Xilinx Artix-7 device, proving competitive when compared with other candidates in the on-ramp standardization effort, namely LESS, MEDS, MAYO, Raccoon and SDitH, and comparable to current standard-selected ML-DSA, FN-DSA, and SLH-DSA in terms of efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring the security of complex system-on-chips (SoCs) designs is a critical imperative, yet traditional verification techniques struggle to keep pace due to significant challenges in automation, scalability, comprehensiveness, and adaptability. The advent of large language models (LLMs), with their remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and advanced reasoning, presents a new paradigm for tackling these issues. Moving beyond monolithic models, an agentic approach allows for the creation of multi-agent systems where specialized LLMs collaborate to solve complex problems more effectively. Recognizing this opportunity, we introduce SV-LLM, a novel multi-agent assistant system designed to automate and enhance SoC security verification. By integrating specialized agents for tasks like verification question answering, security asset identification, threat modeling, test plan and property generation, vulnerability detection, and simulation-based bug validation, SV-LLM streamlines the workflow. To optimize their performance in these diverse tasks, agents leverage different learning paradigms, such as in-context learning, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The system aims to reduce manual intervention, improve accuracy, and accelerate security analysis, supporting proactive identification and mitigation of risks early in the design cycle. We demonstrate its potential to transform hardware security practices through illustrative case studies and experiments that showcase its applicability and efficacy.",

    "abstract": "A threshold signature is an advanced protocol that splits a secret signing key among multiple parties, allowing any subset above a threshold to jointly generate a signature. While post-quantum (PQ) threshold signatures are actively being studied --- especially in response to NIST's recent call for threshold schemes --- most existing solutions are tailored to specially designed, threshold-friendly signature schemes. In contrast, many real-world applications, such as distributed certificate authorities and digital currencies, require signatures that remain verifiable under the standardized verification procedures already in use. Given NIST's recent standardization of PQ signatures and ongoing industry deployment efforts, designing an efficient threshold scheme that interoperates with NIST-standardized verification remains a critical open problem.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we present the first efficient and scalable solution for multi-party generation of the module-lattice digital signature algorithm (ML-DSA), one of NIST's PQ signature standards. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we present a variant of the ML-DSA signing algorithm that is amenable to efficient multi-party computation (MPC) and prove that this variant achieves the same security as the original ML-DSA scheme. Second, we present several efficient & scalable MPC protocols to instantiate the threshold signing functionality. Our protocols can produce threshold signatures with as little as 100 KB (per party) of online communication per rejection-sampling round. In addition, we instantiate our protocols in the honest-majority setting, which allows us to avoid any additional public key assumptions. \r\n\r\nThe signatures produced by our protocols verify under the same implementation of ML-DSA verification for all three security levels. Thus, signatures and verification keys of our scheme are (naturally) the same size as that of ML-DSA; previous lattice-based threshold schemes could not match both of these sizes. Overall, our solution is the only method for producing threshold ML-DSA signatures compatible with NIST-standardized verification that scales to an arbitrary number of parties, without any new assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Message Authentication Codes (MACs) represent a fundamental symmetric key primitive, serving to ensure the authenticity and integrity of transmitted data.\r\nAs a building block in authenticated encryption and in numerous deployed standards, including TLS, IPsec, and SSH, MACs play a central role in practice.\r\nDue to their importance for practice, MACs have been subject to extensive research, leading to prominent schemes such as HMAC, CBCMAC, or LightMAC.\r\nDespite the existence of various MACs, there is still considerable interest in creating schemes that are more efficient, potentially parallelizable, or have specific non-cryptographic attributes, such as being patent-free.\r\n\r\nIn this context, we introduce an automated method for analyzing and synthesizing MAC schemes.\r\nIn order to achieve this goal, we have constructed a framework that restricts the class of MACs in such a way that it is sufficiently expressive to cover known constructions, yet also admits automated reasoning about the security guarantees of both known and new schemes.\r\nOur automated analysis has identified a novel category of MACs, termed \"hybrid\" MACs. These MACs operate by processing multiple blocks concurrently, with each block managed by a different, specified MAC scheme. A key finding is that in certain scenarios, the hybrid MAC marginally outperforms the simultaneous operation of the individual MACs. This improvement is attributed to the hybrid approach exploiting the strengths and compensating for the weaknesses of each distinct MAC scheme involved.\r\nOur implementation confirms that we have successfully identified new schemes that have comparable performance with state-of-the-art schemes and in some settings seem to be slightly more efficient.",

    "abstract": "Threshold signatures enable multiple participants to collaboratively produce a digital signature, ensuring both fault tolerance and decentralization. As we transition to the post-quantum era, lattice-based threshold constructions have emerged as promising candidates. However, existing approaches often struggle to scale efficiently, lack robustness guarantees, or are incompatible with standard schemes \u2014 most notably, the NIST-standard ML-DSA.\r\nIn this work, we explore the design space of Fiat-Shamir-based lattice threshold signatures and introduce the two most practical schemes to date. First, we present an enhanced TRaccoon-based [DKM+24] construction that supports up to 64 participants with identifiable aborts, leveraging novel short secret-sharing techniques to achieve greater scalability than previous state-of-the-art methods. Second \u2014 and most importantly \u2014 we propose the first practical ML-DSA-compatible threshold signature scheme, supporting up to 6 users.\r\nWe provide full implementations and benchmarks of our schemes, demonstrating their practicality and efficiency for real-world deployment as protocol messages are computed in at most a few milliseconds, and communication cost ranges from 10.5 kB to 525 kB depending on the threshold.",

    "abstract": "Gao et al. (IEEE Internet of Things Journal 2024) proposed public-key inverted-index keyword search with designated tester as an extension of public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS). In their scheme, a server (a tester) has a secret key and uses the key for running the search algorithm due to the designated tester setting. They proved that no information of keyword is revealed from trapdoors under the decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption. However, they also employed a symmetric pairing which can be seen as a DDH-solver. Thus, it is expected that information of keyword is revealed from trapdoors since the underlying complexity assumption does not hold. In this paper, we demonstrate two attacks against the Gao et al.'s scheme where information of keyword is revealed from a trapdoor. The first attack completes by using only the server's secret key in addition to the challenge trapdoor, without any additional encryption/trapdoor queries. We remark that an adversary is not allowed to obtain the server's secret key in their security model, and our attack is outside of their security model. Thus, we discuss the roles of the server, and stress that our attack scenario is reasonable. The second attack does not employ the server's secret key and utilizes linkability of two trapdoors.  In both attacks, the attack complexity is just two pairing computations and is feasible in terms of the computational cost.",

    "abstract": "In timing-sensitive blockchain applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), achieving first-come-first-served (FCFS) transaction ordering among decentralized nodes is critical to prevent frontrunning attacks. Themis[CCS'23], a state-of-the-art decentralized FCFS ordering system, has become a key reference point for high-throughput fair ordering systems for real-world blockchain applications, such as rollup chains and decentralized sequencing, and has influenced the design of several subsequent proposals. In this paper, we critically analyze its core system property of practical batch-order fairness and evaluate the frontrunning resistance claim of Themis.  We present the Ambush attack, a new frontrunning technique that achieves nearly 100% success against the practical batch-order fair system with only a single malicious node and negligible attack costs. This attack causes a subtle temporary information asymmetry among nodes, which is allowed due to the heavily optimized communication model of the system. A fundamental trade-off we identify is a challenge in balancing security and performance in these systems; namely, enforcing timely dissemination of transaction information among nodes (to mitigate frontrunning) can easily lead to non-negligible network overheads (thus, degrading overall throughput performance). We show that it is yet possible to balance these two by delaying transaction dissemination to a certain tolerable level for frontrunning mitigation while maintaining high throughput. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed delayed gossiping mechanism can be seamlessly integrated into existing systems with only minimal changes.",

We present a focused and accessible overview of the Lasso lookup argument that stands for the foundational component of the Jolt ZK-VM. This article distills the core principles behind Lasso: the sum-check protocol, multilinear polynomials and their extensions, Spark commitment, offline memory-checking, and the evolution of Spark called Surge. By clarifying the underlying protocols and their relationship to innovations like Spark and Surge, we aim to provide researchers and engineers with practical insights into the cryptographic foundations powering both Lasso and the Jolt virtual machine.",

    "abstract": "Sorting arrays encrypted under fully homomorphic encryption remains a fundamental challenge due to the high cost of private comparisons and the incompatibility of conventional sorting algorithms with the encrypted domain. Recently, Hong et al. (IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 2021) proposed a $k$-way sorting network tailored to encrypted real numbers, but its reliance on multiple comparison stages incurs substantial multiplicative depth and significant bootstrapping overhead, even for modest array sizes.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose a novel rank-based sorting algorithm for encrypted real numbers that performs only a single comparison stage, thereby eliminating the need for bootstrapping operations. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method significantly outperforms the $k$-way approach for small to medium array sizes $(n\\leq 1024)$, achieving a $46.91\\times$ speedup at $n=256$ with a total runtime of $79$ seconds. Furthermore, we examine the recent matrix-based rank sort method by Mazzone et al. (USENIX Security '25) and show that integrating our optimized rank construction improves its efficiency. Specifically, we achieve $1.77\\times$ and $2.43\\times$ performance gains for $n=128$ and $n=512$, respectively.",

    "abstract": "We suggest a generalization of homomorphic encryption (HE) schemes from a purely geometrical and lattice-based perspective. All the current reference HE schemes are based on the ring version of the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem. In this proposal, we first investigate LWE-based cryptosystems from a lattice point of view and present a framework that allows to obtain the same result, in geometrical terms, from any lattice \u2014 as long as it contains a sufficiently short trapdoor vector. \r\n\r\nMore precisely, we generalize the classical BGV (Brakerski, Gentry and Vaikuntanathan, ITCS '12) and GSW (Gentry, Sahai and Waters, CRYPTO '14) schemes to purely lattice-based variants, which we call Lattice-BGV and Lattice-GSW.\r\nBy abstracting away the particular hardness assumption, our lattice framework allows to be instantiated with a broader range of lattices and hardness assumptions.\r\nFor example, LWE gives a natural trapdoor for random $q$-ary lattices, and when plugged into our framework one obtains the original BGV and GSW schemes, while in this work we will also consider an instantiation based on the Lattice Isomorphism Problem (LIP), leading to the first more advanced cryptographic scheme build from LIP$^*$. Our framework also gives a geometrical and natural explanation of HE procedures and generalizes some properties, such as the ability to store many messages in a single ciphertext, one for each short trapdoor vector, without relying on any particular algebraic structure.\r\n\r\n$^*$ In a concurrent work Branco, Malavolta and Maradni (ePrint 2025/993) propose an alternative LIP-based FHE construction.",

    "abstract": "Secure messaging protocols allow users to communicate asynchronously over untrusted channels with strong guarantees of privacy, authenticity, forward secrecy, and post-compromise security. However, traditional security analyses of these protocols assume complete trust in the hardware and software of honest participants, overlooking a significant class of real-world threats known as subversion attacks. These attacks alter cryptographic algorithms to compromise security, by exfiltrating secrets or creating vulnerabilities that are often undetected.\r\n\r\nThe notion of reverse firewalls (EC'15), aims at protecting against subversion attacks by introducing a third party, called a \"reverse firewall\" (RF), which sits between a party and the outside world and modifies its  outgoing and incoming messages in a way such that, even if the party's machine has been corrupted (in a way that maintains functionality), security is still preserved. Importantly, the firewall shares no private information with the parties, and parties put no more trust in the firewall than they do in the communication channel. In this work, we address the existing gap in secure messaging and subversion attacks by presenting several key contributions: \r\n\r\n- We design the first subversion-resilient secure messaging protocol based on the model of RF. Our protocol is based on the Signal protocol---the current state-of-the-art in two-party secure messaging, though it lacks subversion resilience---and achieves subversion resilience with only constant overhead over Signal. \r\n\r\n- We develop a subversion-resilient version of the X3DH protocol in the RF model. X3DH is a core component that facilitates secure initial key agreement in Signal's protocol. \r\n\r\n- We introduce and formalize the notion of Continuous Key Agreement with Tamper Detection, an essential concept for subversion-resilient secure messaging. Our notion enables parties to continuously agree on keys, even in the presence of active adversaries capable of partially tampering with the key exchange transcript. We present a construction of our notion and prove its subversion resilience in the model of RF.",

    "abstract": "Differential privacy (DP) has emerged as a preferred solution for privacy-preserving data analysis, having been adopted by several leading Internet companies. DP is a privacy-preserving mechanism that protects against re-identification of individuals within aggregated datasets. It is known that the privacy budget $\\varepsilon$ determines the trade-off between privacy and utility. In this paper, we propose the use of novel set of metrics and an easy-to-implement, step-by-step framework to facilitate the implementation of the DP mechanism on real-world datasets and guide the selection of $\\varepsilon$ based on desired accuracy vs utility trade-off. Currently, for a given query there is no widely accepted methodology on how to select $\\varepsilon$ and choose the best DP mechanism that offers an optimal trade-off between privacy and utility. In order to address this gap, we perform experiments by considering three real-world datasets, aiming to identify optimal $\\varepsilon$ and suitable mechanisms (Laplace or Gaussian) based on privacy utility trade-off as per use case for the commonly used count, sum and average queries for each dataset. Based on our experiment results, we observe that using our metric and framework, one can analyse noise distribution charts of multiple queries, and choose the suitable $\\varepsilon$ and the DP mechanism for achieving a balance between privacy and utility. Additionally, we show that the optimal $\\varepsilon$ depends on the particular query, desired accuracy and context in which DP is implemented, which suggests that an arbitrary, a-prior selection of $\\varepsilon$ cannot provide adequate results. Our framework prioritises the plotting and visualisation of values and results in the DP analysis, making its adoption easy for a wider audience.",

    "abstract": "Linkable Ring Signatures (LRS) allow users to anonymously sign messages on behalf of ad-hoc rings, while ensuring that multiple signatures from the same user can be linked. This feature makes LRS widely used in privacy-preserving applications like e-voting and e-cash. To scale to systems with large user groups, efficient schemes with short signatures and fast verification are essential. Recent works, such as DualDory (ESORICS\u201922) and LLRing (ESORICS\u201924), improve verification efficiency through offline precomputations but rely on static rings, limiting their applicability in ad-hoc ring scenarios. Similarly, constant-size ring signature schemes based on accumulators face the same limitation.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose a framework for constructing constant-size LRS suitable for large ad-hoc rings. We introduce a novel pairing-based Set Membership Argument (SMA) with a proof size of only three group elements. By leveraging KZG polynomial commitments, we optimize the verification to require only constant group exponentiations and pairings, as well as linear field multiplications. Utilizing the SMA, our framework achieves constant-size signatures with verification dominated by linear field operations, outperforming existing schemes that require linear group exponentiations in ad-hoc ring settings. Moreover, it exhibits strong scalability: (i) compatibility with any PKI-based cryptosystem and (ii) scoped linkability, enabling flexible definitions of linking scope.\r\n\r\nWe instantiate our framework using a discrete logarithm public key structure. On the $BN254$ curve, our signature size is fixed at 687 bytes, which to our best knowledge is the shortest LRS for ring sizes larger than 32. For a ring size of 1024, our verification cost is only 10.4 ms, achieving 48.6\u00d7, 2.6\u00d7\u2013467\u00d7, 7.9\u00d7\u201313.2\u00d7, and 2.2\u00d7\u2013102.5\u00d7 improvements over Omniring (CCS\u201919), DualDory (with and without precomputation), LLRing-DL (with and without precomputation), and LLRing-P (with and without precomputation), respectively. Moreover, this performance gap continues to grow as the ring size increases.",

Such a scheme can be used to easily implement distributed key generation (DKG) and resharing protocols used in threshold signing and decryption protocols.  Our scheme is a minor variation on known techniques, and is not the most efficient in terms of communication and computational complexity.  However, it is extremely simple and easy to implement.  Moreover, for moderately sized shareholder committees of up to, say, 13 parties or so, and for applications where a DKG/resharing only needs to be performed occasionally, its performance should be acceptable in practice.",

    "abstract": "The approximate Closest Vector Problem (CVP) is a core computational problem underlying many post-quantum lattice-based signature schemes, including Dilithium, one-more-ISIS, and HuFu. While the security of these schemes is typically expressed in terms of the Inhomogeneous Short Integer Solution (ISIS) problem, it is well-known that ISIS can be efficiently reduced to approximate CVP. Despite its foundational role, approximate CVP with non-negligible approximation factors remains far less explored than other lattice problems such as SVP or LWE, creating a critical gap in both theory and practice.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we bridge this gap by advancing the Colattice framework for solving approximate CVP with large approximation factors. More concretely, (1) We define a practical version of the Colattice algorithm and propose a randomized Nearest Colattice for generating more than one approximate closest vector. (2) Define a formal strategy space for blockwise approximate CVP. (3) Propose a polynomial-time strategy selection algorithm and prove its correctness under standard lattice heuristics. (4) Building on this, we design an efficient security estimator for approximate CVP in both Euclidean and Infinity norms, and extend it to approximate batch-CVP attack settings. (5) By applying this estimator, we perform concrete security evaluations of Dilithium, HuFu, and one-more-ISIS. Our results reveal that the security of Dilithium are 20 $\\log_2({\\rm gates})$ lower than the required security thresholds at NIST levels 3 and 5, and none of the evaluated schemes withstand approximate batch-CVP  attacks with $2^{64}$ queries. (6) We integrate a slicer and Colattice into G6K-CPU, leveraging the Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) technqiue for nearest neighbors search (NNS). This is the first practical implementation of an NNS-accelerated slicer. Our results demonstrate the practical efficiency of approximate CVP and batch-CVP attacks, highlighting the need for more accurate security estimation.\r\n\r\nThese findings underscore the practical importance of accurate approximate CVP modeling and call for a reassessment of current parameter sets in post-quantum signature schemes.",

    "abstract": "Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a promising technology that enables information-theoretic secure key exchange using quantum principles. It is being increasingly deployed in critical sectors through emerging Quantum Key-as-a-Service (QKaaS) models. However, current standards like ETSI GS QKD 014 assume that QKD keys are consumed within trusted environments\u2014an assumption that breaks down in real-world deployments where keys are delivered over classical networks to remote, potentially untrusted endpoints. This creates a security gap at the interface between QKD systems and key-consuming applications. In this paper, we identify this gap and propose a proxy-based solution that secures QKD key delivery using post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Our proxy transparently applies PQC-based signatures and key encapsulation to ETSI-compliant QKD APIs, without requiring changes to existing infrastructure. It supports cryptographic agility, allowing runtime switching between multiple PQC schemes. We benchmark our design using both QKD simulators and production-grade QKD hardware, and show that it introduces minimal overhead with efficient NIST PQC algorithms. Our findings highlight the need for stronger protection of the QKD interface in practical deployments. We advocate for a revision to ETSI GS QKD 014 to include an addendum that addresses this critical gap and promotes end-to-end quantum-safe integration.",

    "abstract": "We describe key recovery attacks on the authenticated stream cipher HiAE, which was recently proposed for future high-throughput communication networks such as 6G by Huawei.  HiAE uses a 2048-bit state, a 256-bit key and produces 128-bit tags, targeting 256-bit security against key and state recovery.  As a nonce-based AEAD scheme, it relies on the uniqueness of the nonce per key for these security claims. Our analysis indicates that a complete recovery of the 256-bit key of HiAE is possible with a complexity of $2^{128}$ data and at most $2^{129.585}$ time in the nonce-respecting attack setting, with various small tradeoffs concerning the data and time complexity.  While infeasible in practice, this attack therefore violates the 256-bit security claim for HiAE.   We describe further complete key-recovery attacks in the nonce-misuse and release of unverfied plaintext (RUP) settings which require only a small constant number of repeated nonces or unverified decryption queries, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Verifiable Timed Signatures (VTS) are cryptographic primitives that enable the creation of a signature that can only be retrieved after a specific time delay, while also providing verifiable evidence of its existence. This framework is particularly useful in blockchain applications. Current VTS schemes rely on signature algorithms such as BLS, Schnorr, and ECDSA, which are vulnerable to quantum attacks due to the vulnerability of the discrete logarithm problem to Shor's Algorithm. We introduce VT-UOV, a novel VTS scheme based on the Salt-Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar (Salt-UOV) Digital Signature Algorithm. As a multivariate polynomial-based cryptographic primitive, Salt-UOV provides strong security against both classical and quantum adversaries. Adapting Salt-UOV into the VTS framework requires addressing challenges such as complex parameters instead of a integer, the computational complexity of solving multivariate equations, and the integration of Time-Lock Puzzles (TLPs) for enforcing delayed signature generation. Our experimental results show that VT-UOV exhibits a unique performance profile among existing VTS constructions. This paper offers a detailed exploration of the VT-UOV scheme and its overall security and performance properties.",

    "abstract": "We construct an efficient pseudorandom correlation generator (PCG) (Boyle et al., Crypto'19) for two-party programmable oblivious linear evaluation (OLE) functionality over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. Our construction (i) has an efficient seed expansion phase, and (ii) comes with a concretely efficient protocol for distributing the seeds that makes black-box use of cryptography and runs in a constant number of rounds. \r\n\r\nPCGs for programmable OLE are known to imply PCGs for generating $n$-party Beaver triples over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. The resultant PCG has a seed setup phase whose communication cost is $n(n-1)$ times than that of the programmable OLE protocol.  The per-party seed size and the seed expansion time have a multiplicative overhead of $2(n-1)$. Prior constructions for efficiently generating multiparty Beaver triples only worked for finite fields $\\mathbb{F}_q$ where $q \\geq 3$ or required one bit of per-party communication for each triple generated (and hence, do not satisfy the PCG definition). Thus, ours is the first concretely efficient PCG for generating Beaver triples over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ in the multiparty setting.\r\n\r\nOur distributed seed generation protocol generates $N = 2^{30}$ two-party programmable OLEs in 3.5 minutes with 255 MB of communication over a LAN network. The PCG seed size is around 55 MB and the expansion phase requires 10 PRG calls and around 229 thousand XOR and AND operations per triple, producing roughly 31,000 triples per second.\r\n\r\nOur PCG for generating multiparty Beaver triples has lower concrete communication cost than the state-of-the-art for small number of parties. When compared to the FOLEAGE protocol (Bombar et al, Asiacrypt 2024) which requires one bit of per-party communication per triple that is generated, our communication cost is lower by $2.4\\times$ when generating $N = 2^{36}$ triples between three parties and is $1.2 \\times $ lower for the case of five parties.\r\n\r\nAt a conceptual level, our protocol deviates from the prior approaches which relied on variants of dual learning parity with noise (LPN) assumption. Instead, our construction combines both the primal and dual versions of LPN to achieve the aforementioned efficiency.",

    "abstract": "At ASIACRYPT 2014, Andreeva et al. put forward a definition for security of authenticated encryption under release of unverified plaintext. They introduced two notions of plaintext awareness (PA1 and its stronger sibling PA2), suggested to be used in conjunction with confidentiality in case of release of unverified plaintext, as well as the notion of integrity under release of unverified plaintext (INT-RUP). Various efforts have been made to develop a unified model (e.g., Ashur et al., CRYPTO 2017, Chang et al., ToSC 2019(4)). With respect to the analysis of existing and new modes under release of unverified plaintext, most research however has focused on INT-RUP security only. Plaintext awareness is less studied and understood.\r\nIn this work, we take a detailed look at the original definitions of PA1 and PA2 security. We observe that the definitions leave too much room for interpretation, and claimed results such as PA1 security of Encrypt-then-MAC are unjustified. The core of the issue lies in the fact that PA1 security is necessarily tied to the implementation of the scheme. To resolve this, we present refined definitions of PA1 and PA2 security. We argue that even for these refined definitions, there is no implementation of Encrypt-and-MAC that is PA1 (nor PA2) secure. For MAC-then-Encrypt, results depend on the actual scheme, as we demonstrate using a negative result and a positive result (from literature, on Romulus-M). Furthermore, we formally prove for Encrypt-then-MAC that (i) there exist implementations that are PA1 insecure and (ii) there exist implementations that are PA1 secure. In other words, Encrypt-then-MAC is insecure under the old definition but secure under the new definition, provided a proper implementation is used. We apply this observation to Isap v2, finalist in the NIST Lightweight Cryptography competition, where we additionally deal with the complication that the same key is used for encryption and authentication.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely employed for their ability to generate human-like text. However, service providers may deploy smaller models to reduce costs, potentially deceiving users. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) offer a solution by allowing providers to prove LLM inference without compromising the privacy of model parameters. Existing solutions either do not support LLM architectures or suffer from significant inefficiency and tremendous overhead. To address this issue, this paper introduces several new techniques. We propose new methods to efficiently prove linear and non-linear layers in LLMs, reducing computation overhead by orders of magnitude. To further enhance efficiency, we propose constraint fusion to reduce the overhead of proving non-linear layers and circuit squeeze to improve parallelism. We implement our efficient protocol, specifically tailored for popular LLM architectures like GPT-2, and deploy optimizations to enhance performance. Experiments show that our scheme can prove GPT-2 inference in less than 25 seconds. Compared with state-of-the-art systems such as Hao et al. (USENIX Security'24) and ZKML (Eurosys'24), our work achieves nearly $279\\times$ and $185\\times$ speedup, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) has emerged as a powerful cryptographic primitive with many implications. While classical iO, combined with the infinitely-often worst-case hardness of $\\mathsf{NP}$, is known to imply one-way functions (OWFs) and a range of advanced cryptographic primitives, the cryptographic implications of quantum iO remain poorly understood. In this work, we initiate a study of the power of quantum iO. We define several natural variants of quantum iO, distinguished by whether the obfuscation algorithm, evaluation algorithm, and description of obfuscated program are classical or quantum. For each variant, we identify quantum cryptographic primitives that can be constructed under the assumption of quantum iO and the infinitely-often quantum worst-case hardness of $\\mathsf{NP}$ (i.e., $\\mathsf{NP}\\not\\subseteq \\mathsf{i.o.BQP}$). In particular, we construct pseudorandom unitaries, QCCC quantum public-key encryption and (QCCC) quantum symmetric-key encryption, and several primitives implied by them such as one-way state generators, (efficiently-verifiable) one-way puzzles, and EFI pairs, etc. While our main focus is on quantum iO, even in the classical setting, our techniques yield a new and arguably simpler construction of OWFs from classical (imperfect) iO and the infinitely-often worst-case hardness of $\\mathsf{NP}$.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a trapdoorless tracker construction for electronic voting that fundamentally reimagines verifiability through information flow control. Unlike existing E2E verifiable systems where receipt-freeness compromises individual verifiability, our approach achieves both simultaneously by requiring only temporary isolation of the voting calculator between ballot casting and verification\u2014when voters enter unique challenges to compute trackers for locating their votes on the public tally board. Our construction leverages perfectly hiding Pedersen commitments and a unique tracker challenge mechanism to simultaneously achieve unconditional individual verifiability, practical everlasting privacy, and receipt-freeness while relying only on standard cryptographic assumptions. When verification failures occur, our system provides transparent accountability by precisely identifying whether the voting calculator or voting device is responsible. The system maintains security even with partial compliance with isolation procedures and offers robust protection against various adversaries while requiring minimal trust assumptions.",

    "abstract": "In this note we present Ligerito, a small and practically fast polynomial commitment and inner product scheme. For the case of univariate and multilinear polynomial evaluations, the scheme has a proof size of $\\sim \\log(N)^2/\\log\\log(N)$ up to constants and for a large enough field, where $N$ is the size of the input. Ligerito is also fast on consumer hardware: when run on an M1 MacBook Pro for a polynomial with $2^{24}$ coefficients over a 32-bit binary field, our Julia prover implementation has a proving time of 1.3 seconds and a proof size of 255 KiB. Ligerito is also relatively flexible: any linear code for which the rows of the generator matrix can be efficiently evaluated can be used. Such codes include Reed\u2013Solomon codes, Reed\u2013Muller codes, among others. This, in turn, allows for a high degree of flexibility on the choice of field and can likely give further efficiency gains in specific applications.",

    "abstract": "Security weaknesses in the symmetric-key components of a cipher can compromise its overall security assurances. With the rapid progress in quantum computing in recent years, there is a growing focus on assessing the resilience of symmetric-key cryptography against possible quantum attacks (e.g., Grover's algorithm).\r\n\r\nThis paper is dedicated to examining the quantum attack resistance of CHAM, a family of lightweight block ciphers developed by a Korean research group. We provide an optimized quantum circuit implementation of CHAM and evaluate its complexity metrics, such as the number of qubits, gate count, and circuit depth, within the context of Grover's search algorithm.\r\n\r\nFor Grover's key search, minimizing the quantum circuit depth is the key optimization goal, particularly when parallel search capabilities are taken into account. Our approach enhances parallelism for a low-depth quantum circuit of the CHAM block cipher, significantly reducing the full circuit depth compared to previous works. For example, in the case of CHAM-128/128, our implementation achieves a full depth of 14,772, compared to 37,768 depth in the best known prior work. This highlights the substantial depth reduction enabled by our parallelism-oriented design, which facilitates more practical quantum attacks.",

    "abstract": "Side-channel analysis (SCA) is a persistent threat to security-critical systems, enabling attackers to exploit information leakage. To mitigate its harmful impacts, masking serves as a provably secure countermeasure that performs computing on random shares of secret values. As masking complexity, required effort, and cost increase dramatically with design complexity, recent techniques rely on designing and implementing smaller building blocks, so-called \u201cgadgets.\u201d Existing work on optimizing gadgets has primarily focused on latency, area, and power as their objectives. To the best of our knowledge, the most up-to-date ASIC-specific masking gadget optimization frameworks require significant manual effort. This paper is inspired by previous work introducing open-source academic tools to leverage aspects of artificial intelligence (AI) in electronic design automation (EDA) to attempt to optimize and enhance existing gadgets and overall designs. We concentrate on evolutionary algorithms (EA), optimization techniques inspired by biological evolution and natural selection, to find optimal or near-optimal solutions. In this regard, our goal is to improve gadgets in terms of power and area metrics. The primary objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods by integrating compatible gates from a technology library to generate an optimized and functional design without compromising security. Our results show a significant reduction in power consumption and promising area improvements, with values reduced by 15% in some cases, compared to the na\u00efve synthesis of masked designs. We evaluate our results using industry-standard synthesis and pre-silicon side-channel verification tools.",

    "abstract": "We propose a public-key cryptosystem based on Jacobian-preserving polynomial compositions, utilizing algebraically invertible polynomial maps with hard-to-invert composition. The construction utilizes polynomial maps over $\\mathbb{Z}_p$, where $p$ is a prime number, with Jacobian determinant equal to 1 to ensure invertibility. The public key function $H : \\mathbb{Z}_p^n \\to \\mathbb{Z}_p^n$ is defined as the composition of invertible polynomial maps $f_1, f_2, \\dots, f_k$, each with Jacobian determinant 1, while the private key consists of the individual components used in the composition. Although inverting the composition is possible, inverting without the knowledge of the factors is computationally infeasible. This system incorporates both triangular and affine polynomial maps. We discuss the construction, provide formal correctness proofs, analyze hardness assumptions, and present a Python-based prototype with benchmark results.",

    "abstract": "In digital advertising, accurate measurement is essential for optimiz- ing ad performance, requiring collaboration between advertisers and publishers to compute aggregate statistics\u2014such as total conver- sions\u2014while preserving user privacy. Traditional secure two-party computation methods allow joint computation on single-identifier data without revealing raw inputs, but they fall short when mul- tidimensional matching is needed and leak the intersection size, exposing sensitive information to privacy attacks.\r\nThis paper tackles the challenging and practical problem of multi- identifier private user profile matching for privacy-preserving ad measurement, a cornerstone of modern advertising analytics. We introduce a comprehensive cryptographic framework leveraging re- versed Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions (OPRF) and novel blind key rotation techniques to support secure matching across multiple identifiers. Our design prevents cross-identifier linkages and in- cludes a differentially private mechanism to obfuscate intersection sizes, mitigating risks such as membership inference attacks.\r\nWe present a concrete construction of our protocol that achieves both strong privacy guarantees and high efficiency. It scales to large datasets, offering a practical and scalable solution for privacy- centric applications like secure ad conversion tracking. By combin- ing rigorous cryptographic principles with differential privacy, our work addresses a critical need in the advertising industry, setting a new standard for privacy-preserving ad measurement frameworks.",

    "abstract": "Private constrained PRFs are constrained PRFs where the constrained key hides information about the predicate circuit. Although there are many constructions and applications of PCPRF, its relationship to basic cryptographic primitives, such as one-way functions and public-key encryptions, has been unclear. For example, we don't know whether one-way functions imply PCPRFs for general predicates, nor do we know whether 1-key secure PCPRF for all polynomial-sized predicates imply public-key primitives such as public-key encryption and secret-key agreement.\r\n    \r\n    In this work, we prove the black-box separation between a 1-key secure PCPRF for any predicate and a secret-key agreement, which is the first black-box separation result about PCPRF. Specifically, we prove that there exists an oracle relative to which 1-key secure PCPRFs exist while secret-key agreement does not. Our proof is based on the simulation-based technique proposed by Impagliazzo and Rudich (STOC 89). The main technical challenge in generalizing the simulation-based technique to PCPRF is the issue of \\textit{unfaithfulness} of Eve's simulation to the real world because our oracle is more complicated than a random oracle. We introduce a new technique which we call the ``weighting\" technique and show how to leverage it to circumvent the issue of unfaithfulness in the proof framework of Impagliazzo and Rudich.",

    "abstract": "Quantum copy-protection (Aaronson, CCC'09) is the problem of encoding a functionality/key into a quantum state to achieve an anti-piracy security notion that guarantees that the key cannot be split into two keys that both still work. Most works so far has focused on constructing copy-protection for specific functionalities. The only exceptions are the work of Aaronson, Liu, Liu, Zhandry, Zhang (CRYPTO'21) and Ananth and Behera (CRYPTO'24). The former constructs copy-protection for all functionalities in the classical oracle model and the latter constructs copy-protection for all circuits that can be punctured at a uniformly random point with negligible security, assuming a new unproven conjecture about simultaneous extraction from entangled quantum adversaries, on top of assuming subexponentially-secure indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) and hardness of Learning with Errors (LWE).\r\n\r\nIn this work, we show that the construction of Aaronson et al (CRYPTO'21), when the oracles are instantiated with iO, satisfies copy-protection security in the plain model for all cryptographically puncturable functionalities (instead of only puncturable circuits) with arbitrary success threshold (e.g. we get CPA-style security rather than unpredictability for encryption schemes), without any unproven conjectures, assuming only subexponentially secure iO and one-way functions (we do not assume LWE). Thus, our work resolves the five-year-old open question of Aaronson et al, and further, our work encompasses/supersedes and significantly improves upon all existing plain-model copy-protection results. \r\n\r\nSince puncturability has a long history of being studied in cryptography, our result immediately allows us to obtain copy-protection schemes for a large set of advanced functionalities for which no previous copy-protection scheme existed. Further, even for any functionality F that has not already been considered, through our result, constructing copy-protection for F essentially becomes a classical cryptographer's problem.\r\n\r\nGoing further, we show that our scheme also satisfies secure leasing (Ananth and La Placa, EUROCRYPT'21), unbounded/LOCC leakage-resilience and intrusion-detection security (Cakan, Goyal, Liu-Zhang, Ribeiro, TCC'24), giving a unified solution to the problem of quantum protection.",

    "abstract": "We evaluate the implementation aspects of Rijndael-256 using the ratified  RISC-V Vector Cryptography extension Zvkn. A positive finding is that Rijndael-256 can be implemented in constant time with the existing RISC-V ISA as the critical AES and fixed crossbar permutation instructions are in the DIEL (data-independent execution latency) set. Furthermore, simple tricks can be used to expand the functionality of key expansion instructions to cover the additional round constants required. However, due to the required additional byte shuffle in each round, Rijndael-256 will be significantly slower than AES-256 in terms of throughput. Without additional ISA modifications, the instruction count will be increased by the required switching of the  EEW (``effective element width'') parameter in each round between 8 bits (byte shuffle) and 32 bits (AES round instructions). Instruction counts for 1-kilobyte encryption and decryption with Rijndael-256 are factor $2.66\\times$ higher than with AES-256. The precise amount of throughput slowdown depends on the microarchitectural details of a particular RISC-V ISA hardware instantiation, but it may be substantial with some high-performance vector AES architectures due to the breakdown of AES pipelining and the relative slowness of crossbar permutation instructions.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based side-channel attack (DLSCA) has become the dominant paradigm for extracting sensitive information from hardware implementations due to its ability to learn discriminative features directly from raw side-channel traces. A common design choice in DLSCA involves embedding traces in Euclidean space, where the underlying geometry supports conventional objectives such as classification or contrastive learning. However, Euclidean space is fundamentally limited in capturing the multi-level hierarchical structure of side-channel traces, which often exhibit both coarse-grained clustering patterns (e.g., Hamming weight similarities) and fine-grained distinctions (e.g., instruction-level variations). These limitations adversely affect the discriminability and generalization of learned representations, particularly across diverse datasets and leakage models. In this work, we propose HypSCA, a dual-space representation learning method that embeds traces in hyperbolic space to exploit its natural ability to model hierarchical relationships through exponential volume growth. In contrast to existing approaches, HypSCA jointly combines hyperbolic structure modeling with local discriminative learning in Euclidean space, enabling the preservation of global hierarchies while enhancing fine-grained feature separation. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that HypSCA achieves up to 51.6% improvement in attack performance over state-of-the-art DLSCA methods, consistently enhancing generalization across diverse datasets and leakage models.",

    "abstract": "The growing adoption of Large Language Models in privacy-sensitive domains necessitates secure inference mechanisms that preserve data confidentiality. Homomorphic encryption offers a promising pathway by enabling computation on encrypted inputs, yet existing approaches struggle to scale efficiently to full transformer models due to limitations in packing schemes, which must efficiently support a wide range of operations, including matrix multiplications, row-wise nonlinear operations, and self-attention. In this work, we present Tricycle, a framework for private transformer inference built on our novel packing scheme, called tricyclic encodings, which are designed to efficiently support these core operations. Tricyclic encodings are a generalization of bicyclic encodings, enabling privacy-preserving batch matrix multiplications with optimal multiplicative depth in order to facilitate parallelized multi-head self-attention. We optimize our matrix multiplications by incorporating Baby-Step Giant-Step optimizations to reduce ciphertext rotations and presenting new ciphertext-plaintext matrix multiplication techniques that relax prior limitations. A further contribution of our work is a lightweight and effective approach for stabilizing the softmax function via statistical max estimation. Our end-to-end implementation on a BERT-Tiny model shows that Tricycle achieves a \\(1.5 \\times\\) to \\(3 \\times\\) speedup over previous approaches, marking a step toward practical and scalable private LLM inference without sacrificing model fidelity.",

    "abstract": "Private Information Retrieval (PIR) allows a client to retrieve an entry from a database held by a server without leaking which entry is being requested. Symmetric PIR (SPIR) is a stronger variant of PIR with database privacy so that the client knows nothing about the database other than the retrieved entry.\r\n\r\nThis work studies SPIR in the batch setting (BatchSPIR), where the client wants to retrieve multiple entries. In particular, we focus on the case of bit entries, which has important real-world applications. We set up the connection between bit-entry information retrieval and set operation, and propose a black-box construction of BatchSPIR from Private Set Intersection (PSI). By applying an efficient PSI protocol with asymmetric set sizes, we obtain our BatchSPIR protocol named $\\mathsf{BitBatSPIR}$. We also introduce several optimizations for the underlying PSI. These optimizations improve the efficiency of our concrete BatchSPIR construction as well as the PSI protocol.\r\n\r\nWe implement $\\mathsf{BitBatSPIR}$ and compare the performance with the state-of-the-art PIR protocol in the batch setting. Our experimental results show that $\\mathsf{BitBatSPIR}$ not only achieves a stronger security guarantee (symmetric privacy) but also has a better performance for large databases, especially in the Wide Area Network (WAN) setting.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing transition to post-quantum cryptography has led to a surge of research in side-channel countermeasures tailored to these schemes. A prominent method to prove security in the context of side-channel analysis is the utilization of the well-established t-probing model. However, recent studies by Hermelink et al. at CCS 2024 demonstrate a simple and practical attack on a provably secure implementation of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transform that raises concerns regarding the practical security of t-probing secure schemes.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present an unsupervised single-trace side-channel attack on a tenth order  masked implementation of fixed-weight polynomial sampling, which has also been proven to be secure in the t-probing model.  Both attacks reveal a mismatch between the correct, well-understood theory of the t-probing model and its practical application, since the security proofs are valid, yet the attacks still succeed at high noise levels.  Therefore, we take a closer look at the underlying causes and the assumptions that are made for transferring t-probing security to practice. In particular, we investigate the amount of noise required for this transfer. We find that, depending on the design decisions made, this can be very high and difficult to achieve.\r\n\r\nConsequently, we examine the factors impacting the required amount of noise and that should be considered for practically secure implementations.  In particular, non-uniformly distributed shares - a setting that is increasingly encountered in post-quantum cryptographic algorithms - could lead to an increased noise requirement, and thus it could reduce the security level of the masking scheme.  Our analysis then allows us to provide practical guidelines for implementation designers, thereby facilitating the development of practically secure designs.",

    "abstract": "HiAE is the fastest AEAD solution on ARM chips to date, utilizing AES round functions while also setting a new performance benchmark on the latest x86 processors. In this paper, we employ algebraic techniques to investigate the security of HiAE. Our findings reveal that HiAE is vulnerable. Firstly, we employ the meet-in-the-middle technique and guess-and-determine technique to recover the state and derive a key-related equation resulting from two layers of AES round functions. Secondly, by adopting an algebraic approach to study the properties of the round function, we decompose the equation into byte-level equations for divide-and-conquer. Finally, we utilize the guess-and-determine technique to recover the key. Collectively, these techniques enable us to present the first full key-recovery attack on HiAE. Our attack achieves a data complexity of $2^{130}$ and a time complexity of approximately $2^{209}$, leveraging both encryption and decryption oracles with a success probability of 1. In a single-key and nonce-respecting scenario, the attack fully recovers the 256-bit key, breaking the claimed 256-bit security against key-recovery attacks.",

    "abstract": "At Eurocrypt 2003, Szydlo presented a search to distinguish reduction for the Lattice Isomorphism Problem (LIP) on the integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^n$. Here the search problem asks to find an isometry between $\\mathbb{Z}^n$ and an isomorphic lattice, while the distinguish variant asks to distinguish between a list of auxiliary lattices related to $\\mathbb{Z}^n$.\r\n\r\nIn this work we generalize Szydlo's search to distinguish reduction in two ways. Firstly, we generalize the reduction to any lattice isomorphic to $\\Gamma^n$, where $\\Gamma$ is a fixed base lattice. Secondly, we allow $\\Gamma$ to be a module lattice over any number field. Assuming the base lattice $\\Gamma$ and the number field $K$ are fixed, our reduction is polynomial in $n$.\r\n\r\nAs a special case we consider the module lattice $\\mathcal{O}_K^2$ used in the module-LIP based signature scheme HAWK, and we show that one can solve the search problem, leading to a full key recovery, with less than $2d^2$ distinguishing calls on two lattices each, where $d$ is the degree of the power-of-two cyclotomic number field and $\\mathcal{O}_K$  its ring of integers.",

    "abstract": "A t-out-of-n threshold ring signature allows $t$ parties to jointly sign a message on behalf of $n$ parties without revealing the identities of the signers. In this paper, we introduce a new generic construction for threshold ring signature, called GCTRS, which can be built on top of a selection on identification schemes, commitment schemes and a new primitive called t-out-of-n proof protocol which is a special type of zero-knowledge proof. In general, our design enables a group of $t$ signers to first generate an aggregated signature by interacting with each other; then they are able to compute a t-out-of-n proof to convince the verifier that the aggregated signature is indeed produced by $t$ individuals among a particular set. The signature is succinct, as it contains only one aggregated signature and one proof in the final signature. We define all the properties required for the building blocks to capture the security of the GCTRS and provide a detailed security proof. Furthermore, we propose two lattice-based instantiations for the GCTRS, named LTRS and CTRS, respectively. Notably, the CTRS scheme is the first scheme that has a logarithmic signature size relative to the ring size. Additionally, during the instantiation process, we construct two t-out-of-n proof protocols, which may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "We consider perfectly secure MPC for $n$ players and $t$ malicious corruptions. We ask whether requiring only security with abort (rather than guaranteed output delivery, GOD) can help to achieve protocols with better resilience, communication complexity or round complexity. We show that for resilience and communication complexity, abort security does not help, one still needs $3t< n$ for a synchronous network and $4t< n$ in the asynchronous case. And, in both cases, a communication overhead of $O(n)$ bits per gate is necessary. \r\n\r\nWhen $O(n)$ overhead is inevitable, one can explore if this overhead can be pushed to the preprocessing phase and the online phase can be achieved with $O(1)$ overhead. This result was recently achieved in the synchronous setting, in fact, with GOD guarantee. We show this same result in the asynchronous setting. This was previously open since the main standard approach to getting constant overhead in a synchronous on-line phase fails in the asynchronous setting. In particular, this shows that we do not need to settle for abort security to get an asynchronous perfectly secure protocol with overheads $O(n)$ and $O(1)$.\r\n\r\nLastly, in the synchronous setting, we show that perfect secure MPC with abort requires only 2 rounds, in contrast to protocols with GOD that require 4 rounds.",

    "abstract": "Quantum copy-protection is a foundational notion in quantum cryptography that leverages the governing principles of quantum mechanics to tackle the problem of software anti-piracy. Despite progress in recent years, precisely characterizing the class of functionalities that can be copy-protected is still not well understood.\r\nTwo recent works, by [Coladangelo and Gunn, STOC 2024] and [Ananth and Behera, CRYPTO 2024, showed that puncturable functionalities can be copy-protected. Both works have significant caveats with regard to the underlying cryptographic assumptions and additionally restrict the output length of the functionalities to be copy-protected. In this work, we make progress towards simultaneously addressing both caveats. We show the following:\r\n- Revisiting Unclonable Puncturable Obfuscation (UPO): We revisit the notion of UPO introduced by [Ananth and Behera, CRYPTO 2024]. We present a new approach to construct UPO and a variant of UPO, called independent-secure UPO. Unlike UPO, we show how to base the latter notion on well-studied assumptions.\r\n- Copy-Protection from Independent-secure UPO: Assuming independent-secure UPO, we show that any m-bit, for m \u2265 2, puncturable functionality can be copy-protected.\r\n- Copy-Protection from UPO: Assuming UPO, we show that any 1-bit puncturable functionality can be copy-protected. The security of copy-protection holds against identical challenge distributions.",

    "abstract": "Git services such as GitHub, have been widely used to manage projects and enable collaborations among multiple entities. Just as in messaging and cloud storage, where end-to-end security has been gaining increased attention, such a level of security is also demanded for Git services. Content in the repositories (and the data/code supply-chain facilitated by Git services) could be highly valuable, whereas the threat of system breaches has become routine nowadays. However, existing studies of Git security to date (mostly open source projects) suffer in two ways: they provide only very weak security, and they have a large overhead.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we initiate the needed study of efficient end-to-end encrypted Git services. Specifically, we formally define the syntax and critical security properties, and then propose two constructions that provably meet those properties. Moreover, our constructions have the important property of platform-compatibility: They are compatible with current Git servers and reserve all basic Git operations, thus can be directly tested and deployed on top of existing platforms. Furthermore, the overhead we achieve is only proportional to the actual difference caused by each edit, instead of the whole file (or even the whole repository) as is the case with existing works. We implemented both constructions and tested them directly on several public GitHub repositories. Our evaluations show (1) the effectiveness of platform-compatibility, and (2) the significant efficiency improvement we got (while provably providing much stronger security than prior ad-hoc treatments).",

    "abstract": "Collaborative graph processing refers to the joint analysis of inter-connected graphs held by multiple graph owners. To honor data privacy and support various graph processing algorithms, existing approaches employ secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocols to express the vertex-centric abstraction. Yet, due to certain computation-intensive cryptography constructions, state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches are asymptotically suboptimal, imposing significant overheads in terms of computation and communication. In this paper, we present RingSG, the first system to attain optimal communication/computation complexity within the MPC-based vertex-centric abstraction for collaborative graph processing. This optimal complexity is attributed to Ring-ScatterGather, a novel computation paradigm that can avoid exceedingly expensive cryptography operations (e.g., oblivious sort), and simultaneously ensure the overall workload can be optimally decomposed into parallelizable and mutually exclusive MPC tasks. Within Ring-ScatterGather, RingSG improves the concrete runtime efficiency by incorporating 3-party secure computation via share conversion, and optimizing the most cost-heavy part using a novel oblivious group aggregation protocol. Finally, unlike prior approaches, we instantiate RingSG into two end-to-end applications to effectively obtain application-specific results from the protocol outputs in a privacy-preserving manner. We developed a prototype of RingSG and extensively evaluated it across various graph collaboration settings, including different graph sizes, numbers of parties, and average vertex degrees. The results show RingSG reduces the system running time of SOTA approaches by up to 15.34\u00d7 and per-party communication by up to 10.36\u00d7. Notably, RingSG excels in processing sparse global graphs collectively held by more parties, consistent with our theoretical cost analysis.",

    "abstract": "The Polynomial Learning With Errors problem (PLWE) serves as the background of two of the three cryptosystems standardized in August 2024 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology to replace non-quantum resistant current primitives like those based on RSA, Diffie-Hellman or its elliptic curve analogue. Although PLWE is highly believed to be quantum resistant, this fact has not yet been established, contrariwise to other post-quantum proposals like multivariate and some code based ones. Moreover, several vulnerabilities have been encountered for a number of specific instances. In a search for more flexibility, it becomes fully relevant to study the robustness of PLWE based on other polynomials, not necessarily cyclotomic. In 2015, Elias et al found a good number of attacks based on different features of the roots of the polynomial. In the present work we present an overview of the approximations made against PLWE derived from this and subsequent works, along with several new attacks which refine those by Elias et al. exploiting the order of the trace of roots over finite extensions of the finite field under the three scenarios laid out by Elias et al., allowing to generalize the setting in which the attacks can be carried out.",

    "abstract": "The use of biometric-based security protocols is on the steep rise. As\r\nbiometrics become more popular, we witness more attacks. For example, recent\r\nBrutePrint/InfinityGauntlet attacks showed how to brute-force fingerprints\r\nstored on an Android phone in about 40 minutes. The attacks are possible because biometrics, like passwords, do not have high entropy. But unlike passwords, brute-force attacks are much more damaging for biometrics, because one cannot easily change biometrics in case of compromise. In this work, we propose a novel provably secure Brute-Force Resistant Biometrics (BFRB) protocol for biometric-based authentication and key reconstruction that protects against brute-force attacks even when the server storing biometric-related data is compromised. Our protocol utilizes a verifiable partially oblivious pseudorandom function, an authenticated encryption scheme, a pseudorandom function, and a hash. We formally define security for a BFRB protocol and reduce the security of our protocol to the security of the building blocks. We implement the protocol and study its performance for the ND-0405 iris dataset.",

    "abstract": "Zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments (zkSNARKs) are notorious for their large prover space requirements, which almost prohibits their use for really large instances. Space-efficient zkSNARKs aim to address this by limiting the prover space usage, without critical sacrifices to its runtime. In this work, we introduce Hobbit, the only existing space-efficient zkSNARK that achieves optimal prover time $O(|C|)$ for an arithmetic circuit $C$. At the same time, Hobbit is the first transparent and plausibly post-quantum secure construction of its kind. Moreover, our experimental evaluation shows that Hobbit outperforms all prior general-purpose space-efficient zkSNARKs in the literature across four different applications (arbitrary arithmetic circuits,  inference of pruned Multi-Layer Perceptron,  batch AES128 evaluation, and select-and-aggregate SQL query) by $\\times$8-$\\times$$56$ in terms or prover time while requiring up to $\\times$23 less total space.\r\n\r\nAt a technical level, we introduce two new building blocks that may be of independent interest: (i) the first sumcheck protocol for products of polynomials with optimal prover time in the streaming setting, and (ii) a novel multi-linear plausibly post-quantum polynomial commitment that outperforms all prior works in prover time (and can be tuned to work in a space-efficient manner). We build Hobbit by combining the above with a modified version of HyperPlonk, providing an explicit routine to stream access to the circuit evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) enables query execution directly over sym-\r\nmetrically encrypted databases. To support realistic query executions over encrypted\r\ndocument collections, one needs SSE schemes capable of supporting both conjunctive\r\nand disjunctive keyword queries. Unfortunately, existing solutions are either practi-\r\ncally inefficient (incur large storage overheads and/or high query processing latency)\r\nor are quantum-unsafe.\r\nIn this paper, we present the first practically efficient SSE scheme with fast con-\r\njunctive and disjunctive keyword searches, compact storage, and security based on the\r\n(plausible) quantum-hardness of well-studied lattice-based assumptions. We present\r\nNTRU-OQXT \u2013 a highly compact NTRU lattice-based conjunctive SSE scheme that\r\noutperforms all existing conjunctive SSE schemes in terms of search latency. We then\r\npresent an extension of NTRU-OQXT that additionally supports disjunctive queries,\r\nwe call it NTRU-TWINSSE. Technically, both schemes rely on a novel oblivious search\r\nprotocol based on highly optimized Fast-Fourier trapdoor sampling algorithms over\r\nNTRU lattices. While such techniques have been used to design other cryptographic\r\nprimitives (such as digital signatures), they have not been applied before in the context\r\nof SSE.\r\nWe present prototype implementations of both schemes, and experimentally val-\r\nidate their practical performance over a large real-world dataset.

    "abstract": "Prior research on ensuring trust in delegated computation through lattice-based zero-knowledge proofs mostly rely on Learning-With-Errors (LWE) assumption. In this work, we propose a zero-knowledge proof of knowledge using the Ring Learning with Rounding (RLWR) assumption for an interesting and useful class of statements: linear relations on polynomials. We begin by proposing, to the best of our knowledge, the first efficient commitment scheme in literature based on the hardness of RLWR assumption. We establish two properties on RLWR that aid in the construction of our commitments: (i) closure under addition with double rounding, and (ii) closure under multiplication with a short polynomial. Building upon our RLWR commitment scheme, we consequently design a RLWR based $\\Sigma_2$ protocol for proving knowledge of a single committed message under linear relations with public polynomials.\r\n\r\nAs an use-case of our proposed $\\Sigma_2$ protocol, we showcase a construction of a quantum-safe Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) scheme by plugging a prior LWR based SSE scheme from (EuroS&P 2023) with our $\\Sigma_2$ protocol. Concretely, using our $\\Sigma_2$ protocol for linear relations, we prove the correctness of an encrypted search result in a zero-knowledge manner. We implement our verifiable SSE framework and show that the overhead of an extra verification round is negligible ($0.0023$ seconds) and retains the asymptotic query execution time complexity of the original SSE scheme.\r\n\r\nOur work establishes results on zero-knowledge proof systems that can be of independent interest. By shifting the setting from RLWE to RLWR, we gain significant (i) efficiency improvements in terms of communication complexity by $O(M)$ (since some prior works on RLWE require rejection sampling by a factor of $M$), as well as (ii) very short proof size ($8.4$ KB) and tighter parameters (since RLWR does not explicitly manipulate error polynomials like RLWE).",

    "abstract": "Authenticated encryption (AE) is a fundamental tool in today's secure communication. Numerous designs have been proposed, including well-known standards such as GCM. While their performance for long inputs is excellent, that for short inputs is often problematic due to high overhead in computation, showing a gap between the real need for IoT-like protocols where packets are often very short. Existing dedicated short-input AEs are very scarce, the classical Encode-then-encipher (Bellare and Rogaway, Asiacrypt 2000) and Manx (Adomnic\\u{a}i et al., CT-RSA 2023), using up to two block cipher calls. They have superior performance for (very) short inputs, however, security is up to $n/2$ bits, where $n$ is the block size of the underlying block cipher.  \r\n    This paper proposes a new family of short-input AEs, dubbed Cymric, which ensures beyond-birthday-bound (BBB) security. It supports a wider range of input space than EtE and Manx with the help of one additional block cipher call (thus three calls). In terms of the number of block cipher calls, Cymric is the known minimum construction of BBB-secure AEs, and we also prove this is indeed minimal by presenting an impossibility result on BBB-secure AE with two calls. Finally, we show a comprehensive benchmark on microcontrollers to show performance advantage over existing schemes.",

    "abstract": "Homomorphic encryption (HE) schemes have gained significant popularity in modern privacy-preserving applications across various domains. While research on HE constructions based on learning with errors (LWE) and ring-LWE has received major attention from both cryptographers and software-hardware designers alike, their module-LWE-based counterpart has remained comparatively under-explored in the literature. A recent work provides a module-LWE-based instantiation (MLWE-HE) of the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme and showcases several of its advantages such as parameter flexibility and improved parallelism. However, a primary limitation of this construction is the quadratic growth in the size of the relinearization keys. Our contribution is two-pronged: first, we present a new relinearization key-generation technique that addresses the issue of quadratic key size expansion by reducing it to linear growth. Second, we extend the application of MLWE-HE in a multi-group homomorphic encryption (MGHE) framework, thereby generalizing the favorable properties of the single-keyed HE to a multi-keyed setting as well as investigating additional flexibility attributes of the MGHE framework.",

    "abstract": "Single decryptor encryption (SDE) is public key encryption (PKE) where the decryption key is an unclonable quantum state. Coladangelo, Liu, Liu, and Zhandry (CRYPTO 2021) realized the first SDE assuming subexponentially secure indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) and one-way functions (OWFs), along with the polynomial hardness of the learning with errors (LWE) assumption. Since then, SDE has played a pivotal role in recent advances in quantum cryptography. However, despite its central importance in unclonable cryptography, many fundamental questions about SDE remain unanswered. For example, a line of works has proposed various security notions for SDE, but their relationships have hardly been discussed. Moreover, while many subsequent works have adopted the construction methodology of Coladangelo et al., none have explored its improvement, leaving the possibility of a more efficient approach to SDE.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we address these fundamental questions concerning SDE. Our contributions are threefold.\r\n\r\nNew security notion: We introduce a strengthened indistinguishability-based security notion for SDE, which we call CPA+ anti-piracy security. We show that CPA+ security unifies the existing security notions for SDE, as detailed in the third item.\r\n\r\nNew construction: We present an SDE scheme that satisfies CPA+ anti-piracy security, based solely on polynomially secure iO and OWFs. In addition to relying on weaker and more general assumptions, our SDE scheme offers a significant advantage over the scheme of Coladangelo et al., as both the construction and its security proof are much simpler.\r\n\r\nRelationships among security notions: We demonstrate that CPA+ anti-piracy security implies all existing security notions for SDE, with the sole exception of identical challenge ciphertext security proposed by Georgiou and Zhandry (EPRINT 2020). Although we do not establish a direct implication from CPA+ anti-piracy security to identical challenge ciphertext security, we provide a generic transformation from an SDE scheme satisfying the former to one achieving the latter in the quantum random oracle model. Additionally, we establish various relationships among different security notions for SDE. By combining these results with our SDE construction, we derive several new feasibility results.",

    "abstract": "Succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (SNARKs) based on lattice assumptions offer a promising post-quantum alternative to pairing-based systems, but have until now suffered from inherently quadratic proof sizes in the security parameter. We introduce RoK and Roll, the first lattice-based SNARK that breaks the quadratic barrier, achieving communication complexity of $\\tilde{O}(\\lambda)$ together with a succinct verification time. The protocol significantly improves upon the state of the art of fully-succinct argument systems established by ``RoK, Paper, SISsors'' (RPS) [ASIACRYPT'24] and hinges on two key innovations, presented as reductions of knowledge (RoKs):\r\n-  Structured random projections: We introduce a new technique for structured random projections that allows us to reduce the witness dimensions while approximately preserving its $\\ell_2$ norm and maintaining the desired tensor structure. In order to maintain succinct communication and verification, the projected image is further committed and adjoined to the original relation. This procedure is recursively repeated until dimension of the intermediate witness becomes $\\mathsf{poly}(\\lambda)$, i.e. independent of the original witness length. \r\n - Unstructured random projection: When the witness is sufficiently small, we let the unstructured projection (over coefficients $\\mathbb{Z}_q$) be sent in plain, as in LaBRADOR [CRYPTO'23]. We observe, however, that the strategy from prior works to immediately lift the projection claim to $\\mathcal{R}_q$, and into our relation, would impose a quadratic communication cost. Instead, we gradually batch-and-lift the projection a the tower of intermediate ring extensions. This reduces the communication cost to $\\tilde{O}(\\lambda)$ while maintaining a succinct verification time.\r\nThese two techniques, combined with existing RoKs from RPS, yield a succinct argument system with communication complexity $\\tilde{O}(\\lambda)$ and succinct verification for structured linear relations.",

    "abstract": "We propose the first updatable white-box secure cipher, EWEMrl, and its natural extension EWEMxl, both achieving longevity against non-adaptive read-only malware. The notion of longevity, introduced by Koike et al., addresses continuous code leakage and is stronger than incompressibility. While Yoroi claimed longevity, but was broken by Isobe and Todo. Given the prevalence of continuous leakage, developing such ciphers is crucial in white-box cryptography. Precisely, we have the following.\r\n\r\n\u2022 We first introduce EWEMr (Extended WEM against non-adaptive read-only adversaries), a generalization of WEM (White-box Even-Mansour). WEM is the first (and possibly only) white-box cipher based on EM, replacing its key addition layer with a secret Sbox. EWEMr achieves a high space-hardness bound, with a new generic proof strategy, but does not provide longevity. Instead, it serves as the base for EWEMrl.\r\n\r\n\u2022 We also present EWEMx, which uses EWEMr as subroutines and is secure in the stronger adaptive model. While EWEMx does not achieve longevity, it is the base design for EWEMxl.\r\n\r\n\u2022 We next propose EWEMrl, which is the first cipher to achieve longevity against non-adaptive read-only adversaries. No existing ciphers, such as SPNbox and SPACE, are designed for longevity. We show that EWEMrl ensures (against non-adaptive read-only adversaries) (1) longevity, (2) high space-hardness in both known-space and chosen-space settings, and (3) security against hybrid code-lifting attacks.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Finally, we introduce EWEMxl, a natural extension of EWEMrl with a structure similar to EWEMx. EWEMxl achieves (2) and (3) in the stronger adaptive model while maintaining (1) in the same non-adaptive and read-only setting.\r\n\r\nIn summary, EWEMrl and EWEMxl are the first ciphers providing longevity against non-adaptive read-only malware while ensuring security confidence in the black-box setting.",

    "abstract": "Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms should remain secure even in the presence of quantum computers. Although the security of such schemes is guaranteed at the algorithmic level, real-world implementations often suffer from other vulnerabilities like Side-Channel Attacks (SCA).  This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper investigates side-channel attacks targeting implementations of PQC algorithms.  This work categorizes attacks from an adversarial perspective to identify the most vulnerable components of the algorithms' implementations and highlights unexplored parts in current implementations. In addition, it reviews and analyzes the efficiency and efficacy of existing countermeasures to SCA in current hardware implementations. This approach helps identify countermeasures that provide broader protection and highlights characteristics needed for future secure implementations. Our findings offer guidance in strengthening existing systems and developing more efficient defenses against side-channel attacks.",

    "abstract": "Modern efficient secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocols typically follow an offline-online design, where offline protocols produce a sufficient amount of correlated randomness that would be consumed during the online phases. The past decades have witnessed maturing of efficient online protocols, for computing circuits over either arbitrary finite fields or rings $\\mathbb{Z}_{p^k}$. In particular, protocols tailored for $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$ arithmetic have achieved better concrete efficiency in most real-life applications, as it naturally captures modern CPU architectures. On the other hand, a recent paradigm of {\\em pseudorandom correlation generator} (PCG) initiated by Boyle et al. (CCS'18, Crypto'19) opens a door to efficient preprocessing with sublinear communication. Since then, PCGs have been extensively studied and developed to produce various types of correlations required from online protocols. Although Li et al. (EuroCrypt'25) recently put a significant step forward and propose efficient PCGs for arbitrary finite fields, the current state of PCGs for rings is not satisfying at all.\r\nTowards the great demand for efficiently generating correlations over rings, we investigate PCGs for general Galois rings, which simultaneously unify finite fields and integer rings modulo $p^k$. In summary, we establish the following results:\r\n\r\n(i) We generalize the state-of-the-art PCG constructions for oblivious linear evaluations (OLE) over Galois fields to {\\em arbitrary Galois rings}, basing on Galois theory and the Hensel lift. Moreover, our PCGs for Galois rings are as efficient as PCGs for fields. Concretely, for $mN$ OLE correlations over $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$, we require $O(m\\log{N})$ communication and $O(m^2N\\log{N})$ computation, where $m$ is an arbitrary integer $\\geq 2$. In comparison, to our best knowledge, previous approaches incur communication at least linear in $N$.\r\n\r\n(ii) We extend the above OLE construction to provide various types of correlations over any Galois ring. One of the fascinating applications is an efficient PCG for two-party SPD$\\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$ authenticated multiplication triples (Crypto'18). For $mN$ SPD$\\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$ triples, our approach requires only $O(m\\log{N})$ communication and $O(m^2N\\log{N})$ computation. Concrete evaluations show that our method significantly outperforms existing schemes based on homomorphic encryption.\r\n\r\n(iii) In addition, our PCGs for Galois rings also enable multi-party multiplication triple generation, yielding the first efficient MPC protocol for arithmetic circuits over $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$ with \\emph{silent} and \\emph{sublinear} preprocessing. Additional applications include circuit-dependent preprocessing and matrix multiplication triples, etc, which are of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Enhanced Privacy Identification (EPID) is one of the anonymous authentication mechanisms that found their way into the industry, being deployed in billions of chips and standardized at ISO. The linchpin of EPID lies in its decentralized revocation procedure that allows to revoke a signer by simply placing one of its signatures on a signature revocation list SRL. Each new signature must then include a proof that it has been generated with a key different from those used to produce the signatures on the SRL. This proof of non-revocation in current post-quantum schemes either relies on general-purpose NIZKs or on regular zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) but with a witness dimension linear in the size of the SRL, which leads to large size and/or computational complexity. \r\nIn this paper, we rethink the standard approach of non-revocation so as to avoid its heavy reliance on ZKP. Our construction indeed combines features from different tools (such as Falcon signatures) that are unusual in this context to pull most elements out of the ZKP, leading to significant performance improvements. Providing all these elements unconcealed creates many security challenges for our construction but we yet manage to address all of them and prove security under well-understood lattice assumptions, and in the strong model of Sanders-Traor\u00e9 (CT-RSA'21) allowing malicious SRLs.",

    "abstract": "Censorship resilience is a fundamental assumption underlying the security of blockchain protocols. Additionally, the analysis of blockchain security from an economic and game theoretic perspective has been growing in popularity in recent years.\r\nIn this work, we present a surprising rational censorship attack on blockchain censorship resilience when we adopt the analysis of blockchain security from a game theoretic lens and assume all users are rational. \r\nIn our attack, a colluding group with sufficient voting power censors the remainder nodes such that the group alone can gain all the rewards from maintaining the blockchain.\r\nWe show that if nodes are rational, coordinating this attack just requires a public read and write blackboard and we formally model the attack using a game theoretic framework.\r\nFurthermore, we note that to ensure the success of the attack, nodes need to know the total true voting power held by the colluding group.\r\nWe prove that the strategy to join the rational censorship attack and also for nodes to honestly declare their power is a subgame perfect equilibrium in the corresponding extensive form game induced by our attack.\r\nFinally, we discuss the implications of the attack on blockchain users and protocol designers as well as some potential countermeasures.",

    "abstract": "Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) between any two entities is one of the most important security protocols available for securing our digital networks and infrastructures. In PQCrypto 2023, Bruckner, Ramacher and Striecks proposed a novel hybrid AKE (HAKE) protocol dubbed Muckle+ that is particularly useful in large quantum-safe networks consisting of a large number of nodes. Their protocol is hybrid in the sense that it allows key material from conventional, post-quantum, and quantum cryptography primitives to be incorporated into a single end-to-end authenticated shared key.\r\n\r\nTo achieve the desired authentication properties, Muckle+ utilizes post-quantum digital signatures. However, available instantiations of such signatures schemes are not yet efficient enough compared to their post-quantum key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM) counterparts, particularly in large networks with potentially several connections in a short period of time.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this gap, we propose Muckle# that pushes the efficiency boundaries of currently known HAKE constructions. Muckle# uses post-quantum key-encapsulating mechanisms for implicit authentication inspired by recent works done in the area of Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, particularly, in KEMTLS (CCS'20). \r\n\r\nWe port those ideas to the HAKE framework and develop novel proof techniques on the way. Due to our KEM-based approach, the resulting protocol has a slightly different message flow compared to prior work that we carefully align with the HAKE framework and which makes our changes to Muckle+ non-trivial. Lastly, we evaluate the approach by a prototypical implementation and a direct comparison with Muckle+ to highlight the efficiency gains.",

    "abstract": "NTRU-based structured lattices underpin several standardized post-quantum cryptographic schemes, most notably the Falcon signature algorithms. While offering compactness and efficiency, the algebraic structure of NTRU lattices introduces new vulnerabilities under physical attacks, where partial secret key leakage may occur.\r\n\r\nThis work addresses the problem of full key recovery in NTRU-based schemes when adversaries obtain partial information through side-channel or fault attacks. Existing leakage-aware frameworks, including the DDGR estimator and the approach of May and Nowakowski, either lack scalability or are limited to structured, single-source leakage on one secret vector. These constraints make them ineffective against practical leakage patterns in NTRU settings.\r\n\r\nWe propose a unified and scalable framework for recovering NTRU secret keys under partial leakage. Our method supports diverse hint types, such as perfect hints, modular hints, and low-bit leakage, and enables joint integration of leakage across both secret polynomials \\( f \\) and \\( g \\). At its core, the framework uses a dimension-reduction strategy to eliminate \r\nknown coefficients and reduce the problem to a lower-dimensional NTRU instance suitable for lattice reduction. Additionally, we introduce a transformation that converts hints on \\( g \\) into modular constraints on \\( f \\), allowing unified hint embedding.\r\n\r\nWe demonstrate practical attacks on Falcon using NIST reference implementations. Leaking 400 coefficients of $f$ in Falcon-512 reduces the required BKZ block size from over 350 to 38, enabling full key recovery within 6 hours. Compared to MN23, our method achieves significant speedups: $5.83\\times$ for Falcon-512 with 400 leaked coefficients, and over $15\\times$ for Falcon-1024 with 910 leaked coefficients. These results highlight the efficiency and scalability of our framework and the importance of leakage-resilient design for structured NTRU lattices.",

    "abstract": "Since attribute-based encryption (ABE) was proposed in 2005, it has established itself as a valuable tool in the enforcement of access control. For practice, it is important that ABE satisfies many desirable properties such as multi-authority and negations support. Nowadays, we can attain these properties simultaneously, but none of these schemes have been implemented. Furthermore, although simpler schemes have been optimized extensively on a structural level, there is still much room for improvement for these more advanced schemes. However, even if we had schemes with such structural improvements, we would not have a way to benchmark and compare them fairly to measure the effect of such improvements. The only framework that aims to achieve this goal, ABE Squared (TCHES '22), was designed with simpler schemes in mind.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose the ABE Cubed framework, which provides advanced benchmarking extensions for ABE Squared. To motivate our framework, we first apply structural improvements to the decentralized ciphertext-policy ABE scheme supporting negations presented by Riepel, Venema and Verma (ACM CCS '24), which results in five new schemes with the same properties. We use these schemes to uncover and bridge the gaps in the ABE Squared framework. In particular, we observe that advanced schemes depend on more \"variables\" that affect the schemes' efficiency in different dimensions. Whereas ABE Squared only considered one dimension (as was sufficient for the schemes considered there), we devise a benchmarking strategy that allows us to analyze the schemes in multiple dimensions. As a result, we obtain a more complete overview on the computational efficiency of the schemes, and ultimately, this allows us to make better-founded choices about which schemes provide the best efficiency trade-offs for practice.",

    "abstract": "Steganography is the practice of concealing messages or information within other non-secret text or media to avoid detection. A central challenge in steganography is balancing payload size with detectability and media constraints\u2014larger payloads increase the risk of detection and require proportionally larger or higher-capacity carriers. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that combines Huffman coding, suitable dictionary identification, and large language models (LLMs) rephrasing techniques to significantly reduce payload size. This enables more efficient use of limited-capacity carriers, such as images, while minimizing the visual or statistical footprint. Our method allows for the embedding of larger payloads into fixed-size media, addressing a key bottleneck in traditional steganographic systems. By optimizing payload compression prior to encoding, we improve both the stealth and scalability of steganographic communication.",

    "abstract": "In electronic voting systems, guaranteeing voter anonymity is essential. One primary method to ensure this is the use of a mix-net, in which a set of mix-servers sequentially shuffle a set of encrypted votes, and generate proofs that a correct permutation has been applied. Whilst mix-nets offer advantages over alternative approaches,  their traditional use during the tallying phase introduces a significant robustness bottleneck: the process is inherently sequential and critically depends on trusted authorities to perform shuffling and decryption. Any disruption can prevent the final result from being revealed.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose offline mixing OMIX, the first voting framework to support a mix-net-based system in which trustees never handle encrypted votes, while also ensuring that each voter's cost is independent of the total number of voters. In particular, the contributions of permutations by mix-servers and decryption shares by trustees are completed and publicly verified before any vote is cast. This eliminates the need for their participation during tallying and enables the first scalable, mix-net-based, and self-tallying voting protocol in the sense of Kiayias and Yung (PKC'02).\r\n\r\nAt the core of OMIX is a distributed key-generation mechanism: each voter locally generates a private voting key and registers a constant-size set of basis public keys. These are permuted and partially decrypted in an offline phase, resulting in a final public decryption key that reveals votes in shuffled order. Our construction leverages the homomorphic and structure-preserving properties of function-hiding inner-product functional encryption, combined with standard primitives, to achieve self-tallying, client scalability, ballot privacy and other voting properties. To support the new mixing structure introduced by OMIX, we also develop a compact and verifiable offline mix-net, based on an enhanced linearly homomorphic signature scheme. This latter primitive may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Argument systems are a fundamental ingredient in many cryptographic constructions. The best-performing argument systems to date largely rely on a trusted setup, which is undesirable in trust-minimized applications. While transparent argument systems avoid this trust assumption, they have historically been inefficient, typically exhibiting polylogarithmic proof sizes compared to their trusted counterparts. In 2023, Arun et al. (PKC 2023) constructed the first transparent constant-sized polynomial commitment scheme (PCS), leading to transparent constant-sized arguments. However, the evaluation proof still comprises 66 group elements in a group of unknown order (GUO), rendering it rather impractical. In this work, we address this challenge by presenting a set of novel batching and aggregation techniques tailored for proofs of knowledge of ranges in GUOs. These techniques may also be of independent interest and are readily applicable to enhance and shorten other existing schemes in GUOs. Consequently, by applying these techniques, we immediately achieve an improved PCS with an evaluation proof consisting of only 10 group elements---an impressive 85% reduction. To our knowledge, this represents the shortest PCS in the transparent setting. Thus compiling known information-theoretic proof systems using our improved PCS yields highly compact transparent argument systems when instantiated in a class group, which is more practical than prior constant-sized schemes.",

    "abstract": "In 2000, Pliam showed that there does not exist an upper or lower bound in terms of Shannon entropy alone for the number of guesses required in order to guess some randomly sampled element $s$ with certainty $0<q<1$, denoted as marginal guesswork. \r\n   In comparison, it was shown by Arikan in 1996 that, if the distribution is defined over finite support, the expected guesswork, that is the expected amount of trials it takes to guess some random element $s$ with certainty, is bound in terms of R\\'enyi entropy $\\operatorname{H}_{1/2}$.\r\n   In this paper, we  utilize the Theorem of Berry-Ess\\'een to amend Pliams result. We show that there exists some asymptotic expression for the marginal guesswork in terms of Shannon entropy, variance in information and the probit function, provided $q$ is fixed.",
