        "abstract": "Let n stands for the length of digital signatures with quadratic multivariate public rule in n variables. We construct postquantum secure procedure to sign O(n^t),  t \u22651  digital documents with the signature  of size n in time O(n^{3+t}). It allows to sign O(n^t), t <1 in time  O(n^4).  The procedure is defined in terms of Algebraic Cryptography. Its security rests on the semigroup based protocol of Noncommutative Cryptography referring to complexity of the decomposition of the collision element into composition into given generators. The protocol uses the semigroup of Eulerian transformations of variety (K*)^n  where K* is a nontrivial multiplicative group of the finite commutative ring K.  Its execution complexity is O(n^3).  Additionally we use this protocol to define asymmetric cryptosystem with the space of plaintexts and ciphertexts (K*)^n  which allows users to encrypt and decrypt O(n^t)  documents of size n in time O(n^{3+[t]}) where [x] stands for the flow function from x. Finally we suggest protocol based cryptosystem working with plaintext space (K*)^n and the space of ciphertext K^n which allows decryption of O(n^t), t>1 documents of size n in time O(n^{t+3}), t>1. The multivariate encryption map has linear degree O(n) and density O(n^4). We discuss the idea of public key with Eulerian transformations which allows to sign O(n^t), t\u22650 documents in time O(n^{t+2}). The idea of delivery and usage of several Eulerian and quadratic transformations is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Efficient polynomial multiplication routines are critical to the performance of lattice-based post-quantum cryptography (PQC). As PQC standards only recently started to emerge, CPUs still lack specialized instructions to accelerate such routines. Meanwhile, deep learning has grown immeasurably in importance. Its workloads call for teraflops-level of processing power for linear algebra operations, mainly matrix multiplication. Computer architects have responded by introducing ISA extensions, coprocessors and special-purpose cores to accelerate such operations. In particular, Apple ships an undocumented matrix-multiplication coprocessor, AMX, in hundreds of millions of mobile phones, tablets and personal computers. Our work repurposes AMX to implement polynomial multiplication and applies it to the NTRU cryptosystem, setting new speed records on the Apple M1 and M3 systems-on-chip (SoCs): polynomial multiplication, key generation, encapsulation and decapsulation are sped up by $1.54$-$3.07\\times$, $1.08$-$1.33\\times$, $1.11$-$1.50\\times$ and $1.20$-$1.98\\times$, respectively, over the previous state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "We present a general method to simplify soundness proofs under certain conditions. Given an adversary $\\mathcal{A}$ able to break a scheme $S$ with non-negligible probability $t$, we define the concept of $\\textit{trace}$ of a $\\textit{winning configuration}$, which is already implicitly used in soundness proofs. If a scheme can be constructed that (1) takes a random configuration $e$, being the inputs and execution environment of $\\mathcal{A}$, (2) \"guesses\" a trace, (3) modifies $e$ based on its guess so that the modified configuration $e'$ is statistically indistinguishable from the original one, (4) is then able to execute $\\mathcal{A}$ correctly under the condition that $e'$ is a winning configuration and that $B$'s guess of the trace was correct, and finally (5) that during its execution $\\mathcal{A}$ is unable extract any information about $B$'s guess, then the probability of $B$ winning can be expressed as a simple function of $t$ and the bit-length of the trace, namely $\\frac{t}{2^m}$. Soundness then results if $2^m$ is polynomial in the security parameter.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the concept, a concrete application of this method to a simple binary voting scheme is then described in detail.",

    "abstract": "In this work we revisit the problem of using general-purpose MPC schemes to emulate the trusted dataholder in differential privacy (DP), to achieve the same accuracy but without the need to trust one single dataholder. In particular, we consider the two-party model where two computational parties (or dataholders), each with their own dataset, wish to compute a canonical DP mechanism on their combined data and to do so with active security. We start by remarking that available definitions of computational DP (CDP) for protocols are somewhat ill-suited for such a use-case, due to them either poorly capturing some strong security guarantees commonly given by general-purpose MPC protocols, or having too strict requirements in the sense that they need significant adjustment in order to be satisfiable by using common DP and MPC techniques. With this in mind, we propose a new version of simulation-based CDP, called SIM$^*$-CDP, and prove it to be stronger than the IND-CDP and SIM-CDP and incomparable to SIM$^+$-CDP. We demonstrate the usability of the SIM$^*$-CDP definition by showing how to satisfy it by the use of an available distributed protocol for sampling truncated geometric noise. Further, we use the protocol to compute two-party inner-products with CDP and active security, and with accuracy equal to that of the central model, being the first to do so. Finally, we provide an open-sourced implementation and benchmark its practical performance. Our implementation generates a truncated geometric sample in between about 0.035 and 3.5 seconds (amortized), depending on network and parameter settings, comparing favourably to existing implementations.",

    "abstract": "We study a fundamental problem in Multi-Party Computation,\r\nwhich we call the Multiple Millionaires\u2019 Problem (MMP). Given a\r\nset of private integer inputs, the problem is to identify the subset of inputs that equal the maximum (or minimum) of that set,\r\nwithout revealing any further information on the inputs beyond\r\nwhat is implied by the desired output. Such a problem is a natural\r\nextension of the Millionaires\u2019 Problem, which is the very first Multi-\r\nParty Computation problem that was presented in Andrew Yao\u2019s\r\nseminal work [30 ]. A closely related problem is MaxP, in which\r\nthe value of the maximum is sought. We study these fundamental\r\nproblems and describe several algorithmic approaches and protocols for their solution. In addition, we compare the performance\r\nof the protocols under several selected settings. As applications of\r\nprivacy-preserving computation are more and more commonly implemented in industrial systems, MMP and MaxP become important\r\nbuilding blocks in privacy-preserving statistics, machine learning,\r\nauctions and other domains. One of the prominent advantages of\r\nthe protocols that we present here is their simplicity.

    "abstract": "We explore the possibility of obtaining general-purpose obfuscation for all circuits by way of making only simple, local, functionality preserving random perturbations in the circuit structure. Towards this goal, we use the additional structure provided by reversible circuits,  but no additional algebraic structure.\r\n\r\nWe start by formulating a new (and relatively weak) obfuscation task regarding the ability to obfuscate  random circuits of  bounded length.  We call such obfuscators  random input & output (RIO) obfuscators. We then show how to  construct indistinguishability obfuscators for all (unbounded length) circuits given only an RIO obfuscator ---  under a new  assumption regarding the pseudorandomness of sufficiently long random  reversible circuits with known functionality, which in turn builds on  a conjecture made by Gowers (Comb. Prob. Comp.  '96) regarding the pseudorandomness of bounded-size random reversible circuits.  \r\nFurthermore, the constructed obfuscators satisfy a new measure of security - called random output indistinguishability (ROI) obfuscation - which is significantly stronger than IO  and  may be of independent interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe then investigate the possibility  of constructing RIO obfuscators using local,  functionality preserving  perturbations. Our approach  is rooted in statistical mechanics and can be thought of as locally ``thermalizing''  a circuit while preserving its functionality. We provide  candidate constructions along with a pathway for analyzing the security of such strategies. \r\n\r\nGiven the power of program obfuscation, viability of the proposed approach would provide an alternative route to realizing almost all cryptographic tasks under hardness assumptions that are  very different from standard ones. Furthermore,  our specific candidate obfuscators are relatively efficient: the obfuscated version of an n-wire, m-gate (reversible) circuit with security parameter k  has n wires and poly(n,k)m  gates.   We hope that our initial exploration will motivate further study of this alternative path to cryptography.",

    "abstract": "Universal thresholdizer (UT) was proposed by Boneh et al. in CRYPTO'18 as a general framework for thresholdizing non-threshold cryptographic primitives where a set of $N$ servers, each gets a share such that any set of $k$ servers, each produces a partial result, which can be combined to generate the final result. In many applications of threshold cryptography such as the protection of private keys in a digital wallet, the combining operation of partial results must be protected. In this paper, we extend the UT framework to include password authentication for such protection. We formalize the notion of password protected universal thresholdizer (PPUT) that requires the knowledge of a password to execute the protocol, propose a general construction of PPUT, and prove its security. Our construction uses threshold password authenticated key exchange (TPAKE) with simulation-based security as one of the main building blocks. We define simulation-based security of TPAKE in stand-alone model and give a construction using threshold fully-homomorphic encryption. As an application of PPUT, we propose a new primitive called password protected threshold signature. All the proposed constructions are secure in the standard model, and can be instantiated from lattices.",

    "abstract": "In post-quantum cryptography, permutations are frequently employed to construct cryptographic primitives. Careful design and implementation of sampling random unbiased permutations is essential for efficiency and protection against side-channel attacks. Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic research on this topic. Our work seeks to fill this gap by studying the most prominent permutation sampling algorithms and assessing their advantages and limitations. We combine theoretical and experimental comparisons and provide a C library with the implementations of the algorithms discussed. Furthermore, we introduce a new sampling algorithm tailored for cryptographic applications.",

    "abstract": "A secure multiparty computation (MPC) allows several parties to\r\ncompute a function over their inputs while keeping their inputs private. In its basic setting, the protocol involves only parties that hold\r\ninputs. In distributed MPC, there are also external servers who perform\r\na distributed protocol that executes the needed computation, without\r\nlearning information on the inputs and outputs. Here we propose distributed protocols for several fundamental MPC functionalities. We\r\nbegin with a Distributed Scalar Product (DSP) protocol for computing\r\nscalar products of private vectors. We build upon DSP in designing\r\nvarious protocols for Oblivious Transfer (OT): k-out-of-N OT, Priced\r\nOT, and Generalized OT. We also use DSP for Oblivious Polynomial\r\nEvaluation (OPE) and Oblivious Multivariate Polynomial Evaluation\r\n(OMPE). All those problems involve a sender and a receiver, both of\r\nwhom hold private vectors; the goal is to let the receiver learn the\r\nscalar product of those two vectors. However, in each of these problems the receiver must submit a vector of a specified form. Hence, a\r\ncrucial ingredient in our protocols is a sub-protocol for validating that\r\nthe receiver\u2019s vector complies with the relevant restrictions, without\r\nlearning anything else on that vector. Therefore, while previous studies presented distributed protocols for 1-out-of-N OT and OPE, our\r\nprotocols are the first ones that are secure against malicious receivers.\r\nOur distributed protocols for the other OT variants and for OMPE\r\nare the first ones that handle such problems. In addition, while previous art assumed semi-honest servers, we present protocols that are\r\nsecure even when some of the servers are malicious. Our protocols\r\noffer information-theoretic security and they are very efficient.",

    "abstract": "Since the existing tropical cryptographic protocols are either susceptible to the Kotov-Ushakov attack and its generalization, or to attacks based on tropical matrix periodicity and predictive behaviour, several attempts have  been made to propose protocols that resist such attacks. Despite these attempts, many of the proposed protocols remain vulnerable to attacks targeting the underlying hidden problems, one of which we call the tropical two-sided discrete logarithm with shift. An illustrative case is the tropical Stickel protocol, which, when formulated with a single monomial instead of a polynomial, becomes susceptible to attacks based on solutions of the above mentioned tropical version of discrete logarithm. In this paper we will formally introduce the tropical two-sided discrete logarithm with shift, discuss how it is solved, and subsequently demonstrate an attack on a key exchange protocol based on the tropical semiring of pairs. This particular protocol is compromised due to the existence of efficient (albeit heuristic) solution of the tropical two-sided logarithm problem, and this highlights the ongoing challenges in search of a \"good\" key exchange protocol in tropical cryptography.",

    "abstract": "A Distributed Oblivious RAM is a multi-party protocol that securely implements a RAM functionality on secret-shared inputs and outputs. This paper presents two DORAMs in the semi-honest honest-majority 3-party setting which are information-theoretically secure and whose communication costs are asymptotic improvements over previous work. Let $n$ be the number of memory locations and let $d$ be the bit-length of each location.\r\n\r\nThe first, MetaDORAM1, is \\emph{statistically} secure, with $n^{-\\omega(1)}$ leakage. It has $O(\\log_b(n) d + b \\omega(1) \\log(n) + \\log^3(n)/\\log(\\log(n)))$ bits of communication per memory access. Here, $b \\geq 2$ is a free parameter and $\\omega(1)$ is any super-constant function (in $n$). The best prior work was that of Abraham et al (PKC 2017), which has cost $O(\\log_b(n) d + b \\omega(1) \\log_b(n) \\log^2(n))$. MetaDORAM1 is an asymptotic improvement over the work of Abraham et al whenever $d = O(\\log^2(n))$. \r\n\r\nThe second protocol, MetaDORAM2, achieves \\emph{perfect} security, albeit at the cost of a computationally-expensive setup phase. It has communication cost $O(\\log_b(n)d + b \\log(n) + \\log^3(n)/\\log(\\log(n)))$. The best prior work of Chan et al (ASIACRYPT 2018) has communication cost $O(\\log(n) d + \\log^3(n))$. When $b = \\log(n)$, the communication cost of our protocol is $O(\\log(n) d /\\log(\\log(n)) + \\log^3(n)/\\log(\\log(n)))$, that is a $\\Theta(\\log(\\log(n)))$ factor improvement over that of Chan et al. Our work is the first perfectly secure DORAM with sub-logarithmic communication overhead. This comes at the cost of a once-off (for any given $n$) setup phase which requires exponential (in $n$) computation.\r\n\r\nBy a trivial transformation, these can be transformed, respectively, into statistically and perfectly secure active multi-server ORAM protocols with the same communication costs. These multi-server ORAM protocols are likewise asymptotic improvements over the state of the art.",

    "abstract": "IDentity-based Password Authentication and Key Establishment (ID-PAKE) is an interesting trade-off between the security and efficiency, specially due to the removal of costly Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). However, we observe that previous PAKE schemes such as Beguinet et al. (ACNS 2023), Pan et al. (ASIACRYPT 2023) , Abdallah et al. (CRYPTO 2020) etc. \r\nfail to achieve important security properties such as weak/strong Perfect Forward Secrecy (s-PFS), user authentication and resistance to replay attack. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, no previous (P)AKE (either ID- based or PKI-based (P)AKEs) could achieve s-PFS with two-rounds of communication. In this paper, \r\nwe propose a highly efficient ID-PAKE scheme with s-PFS and KGC-FS using only two rounds of communication, where each party only performs a single pairing operation. We compare our work with previous single pairing-based schemes i.e. Tomida et al. (ESORICS 2019) and Lian et al. (ESORICS 2020) and show that they suffer either s-PFS, KGC-FS attack and replay attack.\r\nIn order to achieve a privacy-preserving PAKE scheme, we give a fix to Lian et al. (ESORICS 2020) in terms of KGC-FS and user authentication. \r\n\r\nWe prove the security of our scheme under standard assumptions such as Discrete Logarithms (DL) and q-strong Diffie-Hellman(q-sDH) assumption in ID-eCK model. Finally, we conduct a proof-of-concept implementation of our scheme vs. previous single pairing-based schemes and show that our scheme imposes the least computation cost and stands in the middle of previous scheme regarding communication cost.",

    "abstract": "An accountable subgroup multi-signature (ASM) is a multi-signature that allows any subgroup of potential signers to jointly sign a message such that the subgroup of co-signers are accountable for the resulting signature and their identities are identifiable to any verifier. In this paper, we pro- pose a novel lattice-based accountable subgroup multi-signature scheme, i.e., vMS2, by combining the group setup method of recently proposed vASM scheme and Damgard et al.\u2019s lattice-based MS2 multi-signature scheme. Key generation, signature generation and verification phases of our proposed scheme are almost identical to the MS2 scheme. In the group setup phase, we generate membership keys which is used for signing a message on behalf of a group G of users. These membership keys are generated via a joint verifiable secret sharing (VSS) scheme in a way that they include a piece of information from the secret keys of all users in G so that any subgroup of users in G having a valid membership key can sign in an accountable fashion. We also present a comparison of the underlying MS2 scheme and our accountable subgroup multi-signature scheme vMS2 to show the cost of accountability. We see that lattice-based accountable subgroup multi-signature scheme can be achieved by adding a one-time one-round group setup whose cost is slightly higher than signature generation and verification of the underlying MS2 signature scheme.",

    "abstract": "Through tremendous efforts, the communication cost of secure multi-party computation (MPC) in the honest-majority setting has been significantly improved.  \r\nIn particular, the state-of-the-art honest-majority MPC protocol by Escudero et al. (CCS'22) takes 12 field elements in total per multiplication gate for arithmetic circuits in the online phase. However, it still requires $12 \\log(5n/4)$ bits of online communication per AND gate for Boolean circuits. That is, for Boolean circuits, no MPC protocol with constant online communication is known. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present an unconditionally secure MPC protocol for Boolean circuits in the honest-majority setting, which has constant online communication complexity and the offline communication complexity linear to the number $n$ of parties. We first describe the semi-honest MPC protocol and then show how to extend it to achieve malicious security, where the maliciously secure protocol has the same communication cost as the semi-honest protocol. \r\nIn particular, our protocol achieves the amortized communication cost $36$ bits per AND gate in the online phase, $18n+24$ bits per AND gate in the offline phase. For those circuit wires that require routing, each wire incurs a communication overhead of $15n$ bits in the offline phase.",

    "abstract": "In order to provide access control on encrypted data, Attribute-based encryption (ABE) defines each user using a set of attributes. Fuzzy identity-based encryption (FIBE) is a variant of ABE that allows for a threshold access structure for users. To address the potential threat posed by future quantum computers, this paper presents a post-quantum fuzzy IBE scheme based on lattices. However, current lattice-based ABE schemes face challenges related to computational complexity and the length of ciphertext and keys. This paper aims to improve the performance of an existing fuzzy IBE scheme by reducing key length and computational complexity during the encryption phase. While negative attributes are not utilized in our scheme, we prove its security under the learning with error (LWE) hard problem assumption in the selective security model. These improvements have significant implications for the field of ABE.",

    "abstract": "Recently, PT-symmetric systems have garnered significant attention due to their unconventional properties. Despite the growing interest, there remains an ongoing debate about whether these systems can outperform their Hermitian counterparts in practical applications, and if so, by what metrics this performance should be measured. We developed a novel PT-symmetric approach for mapping N = 3 pure qubit states to address this, implemented it using the dilation method, and demonstrated it on a superconducting quantum processor from the IBM Quantum Experience. For the first time, we derived exact expressions for the population of the post-selected PT-symmetric subspace for both N = 2 and N = 3 states. When applied to the discrimination of N = 2 pure states, our algorithm provides an equivalent result to the conventional unambiguous quantum state discrimination. For N = 3 states, our approach introduces novel capabilities not available in traditional Hermitian systems, enabling the transformation of an arbitrary set of three quantum states into another, at the cost of introducing an inconclusive outcome. Our algorithm has the same error rate for the attack on the three-state QKD protocol as the conventional minimum error, maximum confidence, and maximum mutual information strategies. For post-selection quantum metrology, our results provide precise conditions where PT-symmetric quantum sensors outperform their Hermitian counterparts in terms of information-cost rate. Combined with punctuated unstructured quantum database search, our method significantly reduces the qubit readout requirements at the cost of adding an ancilla, while maintaining the same average number of oracle calls as the original punctuated Grover's algorithm. This provides significant advantages for NISQ-era computers. Our work opens new pathways for applying PT symmetry in quantum communications, computing, and cryptography.",

Hence, the parameter sets specified in SLH-DSA is tuned to have full security after that many signatures.

    "abstract": "This paper conducts a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of the performance of two innovative cryptographic schemes: Homomorphic Polynomial Public Key (HPPK)-Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) and Digital Signature (DS), recently proposed by Kuang et al. These schemes represent a departure from traditional cryptographic paradigms, with HPPK leveraging the security of homomorphic symmetric encryption across two hidden rings without reliance on NP-hard problems. HPPK can be viewed as a specialized variant of Multivariate Public Key Cryptography (MPKC), intricately associated with two vector spaces: the polynomial vector space for the secret exchange and the multivariate vector space for randomized encapsulation.\r\n\r\nThe unique integration of asymmetric, symmetric, and homomorphic cryptography within HPPK necessitates a careful examination of its performance metrics. This study focuses on the thorough benchmarking of HPPK KEM and DS across key cryptographic operations, encompassing key generation, encapsulation, decapsulation, signing, and verification. The results highlight the exceptional efficiency of HPPK, characterized by compact key sizes, cipher sizes, and signature sizes. The use of symmetric encryption in HPPK enhances its overall performance. Key findings underscore the outstanding performance of HPPK KEM and DS across various security levels, emphasizing their superiority in crucial cryptographic operations.  This research positions HPPK as a promising and competitive solution for post-quantum cryptographic applications in a wide range of applications, including blockchain, digital currency, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.",

    "abstract": "To provide users with anonymous access to the Internet, onion routing and mix networks were developed. Assuming a stronger adversary than Tor, Sphinx is a popular packet format choice for such networks due to its efficiency and strong protection. However, it was recently shown that Sphinx is susceptible to a tagging attack on the payload in some settings. The only known packet formats which prevent this attack rely on advanced cryptographic primitives and are highly inefficient, both in terms of packet sizes and computation overhead.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we provide the first packet format that protects against the tagging attack with an acceptable overhead. At the cost of doubling the payload size, we are able to build a provably private solution from basic cryptographic primitives. Our implementation demonstrates that our solution is as computationally efficient as Sphinx, beating previous schemes by a large margin. For our security proof, we first strengthen the state-of-the-art proof strategy, before applying it to our solution to demonstrate that not only the tagging attack is prevented, but our scheme is provably private.",

    "abstract": "New ideas to build homomorphic encryption schemes based on rational functions have been recently proposed. The starting point is a  private-key encryption scheme whose secret key is a rational function $\\phi/\\phi'$. By construction, such a scheme is not homomorphic. To get homomorphic properties,  nonlinear homomorphic operators are derived from the secret key. In this paper, we adopt the same approach to build HE. We obtain a multivariate encryption scheme in the sense that the knowledge of the CPA attacker can be turned into an over-defined system of nonlinear equations (contrarily to LWE-based encryptions). The factoring assumption is introduced in order to make a large class of algebraic attacks (based on Groebner bases) irrelevant. We extensively analyze the security of our scheme against algebraic attacks. In particular, we exhibit the fundamental role played by symmetry in these attacks. We also formally show that some of these attacks are exponential-time. While we did not  propose a formal security proof relying on a classical cryptographic assumption, we hopefully provide convincing evidence for security.",

    "abstract": "Attribute-Based Signature (ABS),  introduced by Maji et al. (CT-RSA'11), is an advanced privacy-preserving signature primitive that has gained a lot of attention. Research on ABS can be categorized into three main themes: expanding the expressiveness of signing policies, enabling new functionalities, and providing more diversity in terms of computational assumptions. We contribute to the development of ABS in all three dimensions, by providing a fully dynamic ABS scheme for arbitrary circuits from codes. The scheme is the first ABS from code-based assumptions and also the first ABS system offering the \\texttt{full dynamicity} functionality (i.e., attributes can be enrolled and revoked simultaneously). Moreover, the scheme features much shorter signature size than a lattice-based counterpart proposed by El Kaafarani and Katsumata (PKC'18). \r\n\r\nIn the construction process, we put forward a new theoretical abstraction of Stern-like zero-knowledge (ZK) protocols, which are the major tools for privacy-preserving cryptography from codes. Our main insight here actually lies in the questions we ask about the fundamental principles of Stern-like protocols that have remained unchallenged since their conception by Stern at CRYPTO'93.  We demonstrate that these long-established principles are not essential, and then provide a refined framework generalizing existing Stern-like techniques and enabling enhanced constructions.",

    "abstract": "The size of the authentication tag represents a significant overhead for applications that are limited by bandwidth or memory. Hence, some authenticated encryption designs have a smaller tag than the required privacy level, which was also suggested by the NIST lightweight cryptography standardization project.  In the ToSC 2022, two papers have raised questions about the IND-CCA security of AEAD schemes in this situation. These papers show that (a) online AE cannot provide IND-CCA security beyond the tag length, and (b) it is possible to have IND-CCA security beyond the tag length in a restricted Encrypt-then-Encipher framework.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we address some of the remaining gaps in this area. Our main result is to show that, for a fixed stretch, Pseudo-Random Injection security implies IND-CCA security as long as the minimum ciphertext size is at least as large as the required IND-CCA security level. We also show that this bound is tight and that any AEAD scheme that allows empty plaintexts with a fixed stretch cannot achieve IND-CCA security beyond the tag length.\r\n\r\nNext, we look at the weaker notion of MRAE security, and show that two-pass schemes that achieve MRAE security do not achieve IND-CCA security beyond the tag size. This includes SIV and rugged PRPs.",

    "abstract": "Threshold signature schemes have gained prominence in enhancing the security and flexibility of digital signatures, allowing a group of participants to collaboratively create signatures while maintaining a predefined threshold of participants for validity. However, conventional threshold signatures treat all participants equally, lacking the capability to accommodate hierarchical structures often seen in real-world applications. Hierarchical Threshold Signature Schemes (HTSS) naturally extend the concept of simple threshold signatures, offering a solution that aligns with hierarchical organizational structures. Our paper introduces a novel, efficient, and flexible HTSS that employs independent polynomials at each hierarchical level, removing limitations on threshold values. This adaptability enables us to tailor the scheme to diverse requirements, whether signing requires only top-level nodes or lower-level participants' involvement. Based on our analysis, our FlexHi integrated into the FROST scheme outperforms Tassa's hierarchical scheme on FROST and operates approximately 30% to 40% faster, depending on the number of participants and the chosen threshold values. This demonstrates that, in addition to flexibility, our scheme has practical benefits through improved performance.",

    "abstract": "Blockchains suffer from scalability limitations, both in terms of latency and throughput. Various approaches to alleviate this have been proposed, most prominent of which are payment and state channels, sidechains, commit-chains, rollups, and sharding. This work puts forth a novel commit-chain protocol, Bitcoin Clique. It is the first trustless commit-chain that is compatible with all major blockchains, including (an upcoming version of) Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nClique enables a pool of users to pay each other off-chain, i.e., without interacting with the blockchain, thus sidestepping its bottlenecks. A user can directly send its coins to any other user in the Clique: In contrast to payment channels, its funds are not tied to a specific counterparty, avoiding the need for multi-hop payments. An untrusted operator facilitates payments by verifiably recording them.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we define and construct a novel primitive, Two-Shot Adaptor Signatures, which is needed for Bitcoin Clique while being of independent interest. This primitive extends the functionality of normal Adaptor Signatures by allowing the extraction of the witness only after two signatures are published on the blockchain.",

    "abstract": "Basic encryption and signature on lattices have comparable efficiency to their classical counterparts in terms of speed and key size. However, Identity-based Encryption (IBE) on lattices is much less efficient in terms of compactness, even when instantiated on ideal lattices and in the Random Oracle Model (ROM). This is because the underlying preimage sampling algorithm used to extract the users' secret keys requires huge public parameters. In this work, we specify a compact IBE instantiation for practical use by introducing various optimizations. Specifically, we first propose a modified gadget to make it more suitable for the instantiation of practical IBE. Then, by incorporating our gadget and the non-spherical Gaussian technique, we provide an efficient preimage sampling algorithm, based on which, we give a specification of a compact IBE on ideal lattice. Finally, two parameter sets and a proof-of-concept implementation are presented. Given the importance of the preimage sampling algorithm in lattice-based cryptography, we believe that our technique can also be applied to the practical instantiation of other advanced cryptographic schemes.",

    "abstract": "Vector commitments (VC) and their variants attract a lot of attention due to their wide range of usage in applications such as blockchain and accumulator. Mercurial vector commitment (MVC), as one of the important variants of VC, is the core technique for building more complicated cryptographic applications, such as the zero-knowledge set (ZKS) and zero-knowledge elementary database (ZK-EDB). However, to the best of our knowledge, the only post-quantum MVC construction is trivially implied by a generic framework proposed by Catalano and Fiore (PKC '13) with lattice-based components which causes $\\textit{large}$ auxiliary information and $\\textit{cannot satisfy}$ any additional advanced properties, that is, updatable and aggregatable.\r\n\r\nA major difficulty in constructing a $\\textit{non-black-box}$ lattice-based MVC is that it is not trivial to construct a lattice-based VC that satisfies a critical property called ``mercurial hiding\". In this paper, we identify some specific features of a new falsifiable family of basis-augmented SIS assumption ($\\mathsf{BASIS}$) proposed by Wee and Wu (EUROCRYPT '23) that can be utilized to construct the mercurial vector commitment from lattice $\\textit{satisfying}$ updatability and aggregatability with $\\textit{smaller}$ auxiliary information. We $\\textit{first}$ extend stateless update and differential update to the mercurial vector commitment and define a $\\textit{new}$ property, named updatable mercurial hiding. Then, we show how to modify our constructions to obtain the updatable mercurial vector commitment that satisfies these properties. To aggregate the openings, our constructions perfectly inherit the ability to aggregate in the $\\mathsf{BASIS}$ assumption, which can break the limitation of $\\textit{weak}$ binding in the current aggregatable MVCs. In the end, we show that our constructions can be used to build the various kinds of lattice-based ZKS and ZK-EDB directly within the existing framework.",

    "abstract": "A functional commitment allows a user to commit to an input $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\{0,1\\}^\\ell$ and later open up the commitment to a value $y = f(\\mathbf{x})$ with respect to some function $f$. In this work, we focus on schemes that support fast verification. Specifically, after a preprocessing step that depends only on $f$, the verification time as well as the size of the commitment and opening should be sublinear in the input length $\\ell$, We also consider the dual setting where the user commits to the function $f$ and later, opens up the commitment at an input $\\mathbf{x}$.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we develop two (non-interactive) functional commitments that support fast verification. The first construction supports openings to constant-degree polynomials and has a shorter CRS for a broad range of settings compared to previous constructions. Our second construction is a dual functional commitment for arbitrary bounded-depth Boolean circuits. Both schemes are lattice-based and avoid non-black-box use of cryptographic primitives or lattice sampling algorithms. Security of both constructions rely on the $\\ell$-succinct short integer solutions (SIS) assumption, a falsifiable $q$-type generalization of the SIS assumption (Preprint 2023).\r\n\r\nIn addition, we study the challenges of extending lattice-based functional commitments to extractable functional commitments, a notion that is equivalent to succinct non-interactive arguments (when considering openings to quadratic relations). We describe a general methodology that heuristically breaks the extractability of our construction and provides evidence for the implausibility of the knowledge $k$-$R$-$\\mathsf{ISIS}$ assumption of Albrecht et al. (CRYPTO 2022) that was used in several constructions of lattice-based succinct arguments. If we additionally assume hardness of the standard inhomogeneous SIS assumption, we obtain a direct attack on a variant of the extractable linear functional commitment of Albrecht et al.",

    "abstract": "We explore the issue of anonymously proving account ownership (anonymous PAO). Such proofs allow a prover to prove to a verifier that it owns a valid account at a server without being tracked by the server or the verifier, without requiring any changes at the server's end and without even revealing to it that any anonymous PAO is taking place. This concept is useful in sensitive applications like whistleblowing. The first introduction of anonymous PAOs was by Wang et al., who also introduced the secure channel injection (SCI) protocol to realize anonymous PAO in the context of email account ownership. In this paper, we propose YouChoose, an approach that improves upon Wang et al.'s SCI-based anonymous PAO. Unlike SCI, which demands carefully designed multi-party computation (MPC) protocols for efficiency, YouChoose works without MPC, simply relying on the verifier to selectively forward TLS records. It is faster, more efficient, and more adaptable compared to SCI. Further, the simplicity of the YouChoose approach readily enables anonymous PAO in different settings such as various ciphersuites of TLS, account types other than email, etc., while the SCI approach needs specifically designed MPC protocols for each use case. We also provide formal security definitions for a generalized anonymous PAO of which both YouChoose and SCI are concrete instantiations.",

    "abstract": "The Learning With Errors ($\\mathsf{LWE}$) problem asks to find $\\mathbf{s}$ from an input of the form $(\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{s}+\\mathbf{e}) \\in  (\\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z})^{m \\times n} \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z})^{m}$, for a vector $\\mathbf{e}$ that has small-magnitude entries.  In this work, we do not focus on solving $\\mathsf{LWE}$ but on the task of sampling instances. As these are extremely sparse in their range, it may seem plausible that the only way to proceed is to first create $\\mathbf{s}$ and $\\mathbf{e}$ and then set $\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{s}+\\mathbf{e}$. In particular, such an instance sampler knows the solution. This raises the question whether it is possible to obliviously sample $(\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{s}+\\mathbf{e})$, namely, without knowing the underlying $\\mathbf{s}$. A variant of the assumption that oblivious $\\mathsf{LWE}$ sampling is hard has been used in a series of works to analyze the security of candidate constructions of Succinct Non interactive Arguments of Knowledge (SNARKs). As the assumption is related to $\\mathsf{LWE}$, these SNARKs have been conjectured to be secure in the presence of quantum adversaries.  \r\n\r\nOur main result is a quantum polynomial-time algorithm that  \r\nsamples well-distributed $\\mathsf{LWE}$ instances while provably not knowing  the solution, under the assumption that $\\mathsf{LWE}$ is hard. Moreover, the approach works for a vast range of $\\mathsf{LWE}$ parametrizations, including those used in the above-mentioned SNARKs. This invalidates the assumptions used in their security analyses, although it does not yield attacks against the constructions themselves.",

    "abstract": "Verifiable secret sharing (VSS) protocols enable parties to share secrets while guaranteeing security (in particular, that all parties hold valid and consistent shares) even if the dealer or some of the participants are malicious. Most work on VSS focuses on the honest majority case, primarily since it enables one to guarantee output delivery (e.g., a corrupted recipient cannot prevent an honest dealer from sharing their value). Feldman's VSS is a well known and popular protocol for this task and relies on the discrete log hardness assumption.  In this paper, we present a variant of Feldman's VSS for the dishonest majority setting and formally prove its security. Beyond the basic VSS protocol, we present a publicly-verifiable version, as well as show how to securely add participants to the sharing and how to refresh an existing sharing (all secure in the presence of a dishonest majority). We prove that our protocols are UC secure, for appropriately defined ideal functionalities.",

    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a prevalent cryptographic primitive that allows for computation on encrypted data. In various cryptographic protocols, this enables outsourcing computation to a third party while retaining the privacy of the inputs to the computation. However, these schemes make an honest-but-curious assumption about the adversary. Previous work has tried to remove this assumption by combining FHE with Verifiable Computation (VC). Recent work has increased the flexibility of this approach by introducing integrity checks for homomorphic computations over rings.\r\nHowever, efficient FHE for circuits of large multiplicative depth also requires non-ring computations called maintenance operations, i.e. modswitching and keyswitching, which cannot be efficiently verified by existing constructions. We propose the first efficiently verifiable FHE scheme that allows for arbitrary depth homomorphic circuits by utilizing the double-CRT representation in which FHE schemes are typically computed, and using lattice-based SNARKs to prove components of this computation separately, including the maintenance operations. Therefore, our construction can theoretically handle bootstrapping operations.\r\nWe also present the first implementation of a verifiable computation on encrypted data for a computation that contains multiple ciphertext-ciphertext multiplications.\r\nConcretely, we verify the homomorphic computation of an approximate neural network containing three layers and more than 100 ciphertexts in less than 1 second while maintaining reasonable prover costs.",

Although their scheme is very efficient, it cannot resist against the eavesdropping attacks and forgery attack. In this paper, first, the eavesdropping attacks on Qiu et al.\u2019s scheme are proposed. Second, we show the forgery attack on their scheme.

    "abstract": "Class groups of imaginary quadratic fields (class groups for short) have seen a resurgence in cryptography as transparent groups of unknown order. They are a prime candidate for being a trustless alternative to RSA groups because class groups do not need a (distributed) trusted setup to sample a cryptographically secure group of unknown order. Class groups have recently found many applications in verifiable secret sharing, secure multiparty computation, transparent polynomial commitments, and perhaps most importantly, in time-based cryptography, i.e., verifiable delay functions, (homomorphic) time-lock puzzles, timed commitments, etc. \r\n\r\nHowever, there are various roadblocks to making class groups widespread in practical cryptographic deployments. We initiate the rigorous study of hashing into class groups. Specifically, we want to sample a uniformly distributed group element in a class group such that nobody knows its discrete logarithm with respect to any public parameter. We point out several flawed algorithms in numerous publicly available class group libraries. We further illustrate the insecurity of these hash functions by showing concrete attacks against cryptographic protocols, i.e., verifiable delay functions, if they were deployed with one of those broken hash-to-class group functions. We propose two families of cryptographically secure hash functions into class groups. We implement these constructions and evaluate their performance. We release our implementation as an open-source library.",

    "abstract": "Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) constructions typically allow computation over a finite field or ring. While useful for many applications, certain real-world applications require the usage of decimal numbers. \r\nWhile it is possible to emulate floating-point operations in MPC, fixed-point computation has gained more traction in the practical space due to its simplicity and efficient realizations. \r\nEven so, current protocols for fixed-point MPC still require computing a secure truncation after each multiplication gate. \r\nIn this paper, we show a new paradigm for realizing fixed-point MPC. \r\nStarting from an existing MPC protocol over arbitrary, large, finite fields or rings, we show how to realize MPC over a residue number system (RNS). \r\nThis allows us to leverage certain mathematical structures to construct a secure algorithm for efficient approximate truncation by a static and public value. \r\nWe then show how this can be used to realize highly efficient secure fixed-point computation.\r\nIn contrast to previous approaches, our protocol does not require any multiplications of secret values in the underlying MPC scheme to realize truncation but instead relies on preprocessed pairs of correlated random values, which we show can be constructed very efficiently, when accepting a small amount of leakage and robustness in the strong, covert model. \r\nWe proceed to implement our protocol, with SPDZ as the underlying MPC protocol, and achieve significantly faster fixed-point multiplication.",

    "abstract": "As the message recovery-based attack poses a serious threat to lattice-based schemes, we conducted a study on the side-channel secu- rity of parallel implementations of lattice-based key encapsulation mech- anisms. Initially, we developed a power model to describe the power leakage during message encoding. Utilizing this power model, we pro- pose a multi-ciphertext message recovery attack, which can retrieve the required messages for a chosen ciphertext attack through a suitable mes- sage recovery oracle. Building upon the successful message recovery, we further develop a key recovery method based on a ciphertext-choosing strategy that maximizes key recovery accuracy, as well as a lattice reduc- tion attack capable of solving the whole private key from the target LWE instance. To assess the effectiveness of the attack, we conducted experi- ments using Kyber768 implemented on a Xilinx FPGA board. The exper- imental results demonstrate that our attack could successfully recover the private key with 9600 power traces and a computational complexity of 100 bikz, which is a significant advantage over existing attacks. Notably, our attack remains effective despite countermeasures such as masking and shuffling being implemented. This study reveals that parallel im- plementations remain vulnerable to side-channel attacks, and highlights the necessity of additional analysis and countermeasures for lattice-based schemes implemented in parallel.",

    "abstract": "A multidimensional  scalar multiplication  ($d$-mul) consists of computing $[a_1]P_1+\\cdots+[a_d]P_d$, where $d$ is an integer ($d\\geq 2)$, $\\alpha_1, \\cdots, \\alpha_d$ are scalars of size $l\\in \\mathbb{N}^*$ bits, $P_1, P_2, \\cdots, P_d$ are points on an elliptic curve $E$. This operation ($d$-mul) is widely used in cryptography, especially in elliptic curve cryptographic algorithms.\r\nSeveral methods in the literature allow to compute the $d$-mul efficiently (e.g.,  the bucket method~\\cite{bernstein2012faster},   the Karabina et al. method~\\cite{hutchinson2019constructing, hisil2018d, hutchinson2020new}).  This paper aims to present and compare the most recent and efficient methods in the literature for computing the $d$-mul operation in terms of with, complexity, memory consumption, and proprieties. We will also present our work on the progress of the optimisation of $d$-mul in two methods.  The first method is useful if  $2^d-1$ points of $E$ can be stored. It is based on a simple precomputation function.  The second method works efficiently when $d$ is large and  $2^d-1$ points of $E$ can not be stored. It performs the calculation on the fly without any precomputation. We show that the main operation of our first method is $100(1-\\frac{1}{d})\\%$ more efficient than that of previous works, while our second exhibits a $50\\%$ improvement in efficiency. These improvements will be substantiated by assessing the number of operations and practical implementation.",

    "abstract": "X-Wing is a hybrid key-encapsulation mechanism based on X25519 and ML-KEM-768. It is designed to be the sensible choice for most applications. The concrete choice of X25519 and ML-KEM-768 allows X-Wing to achieve improved efficiency compared to using a generic KEM combiner. In this paper, we introduce the X-Wing hybrid KEM construction and provide a proof of security. We show (1) that X-Wing is a classically IND-CCA secure KEM if the strong Diffie-Hellman assumption holds in the X25519 nominal group, and  (2) that X-Wing is a post-quantum IND-CCA secure KEM if ML-KEM-768 is itself an IND-CCA secure KEM and SHA3-256 is secure when used as a pseudorandom function. The first result is proved in the ROM, whereas the second one holds in the standard model.  Loosely speaking, this means X-Wing is secure if either X25519 or ML-KEM-768 is secure.  We stress that these security gaurantees and optimizations are only possible due to the concrete choices that were made, and it may not apply in the general case.",

    "abstract": "We present ReSolveD, a new candidate post-quantum signature scheme under the regular syndrome decoding (RSD) assumption for random linear codes, which is a well-established variant of the well-known syndrome decoding (SD) assumption. Our signature scheme is obtained by designing a new zero-knowledge proof for proving knowledge of a solution to the RSD problem in the recent VOLE-in-the-head framework using a sketching scheme to verify that a vector has weight exactly one. We achieve a signature size of 3.99 KB with a signing time of 27.3 ms and a verification time of 23.1 ms on a single core of a standard desktop for a 128-bit security level. Compared to the state-of-the-art code-based signature schemes, our signature scheme achieves $1.5\\times \\sim 2\\times$ improvement in terms of the common \"signature size + public-key size\" metric, while keeping the computational efficiency competitive.",

    "abstract": "The rising tide of data breaches targeting large data storage centres and servers has raised serious privacy and security concerns. Homomorphic Encryption schemes offer an effective defence against such attacks, but their adoption has been hindered by substantial computational and communication overheads, particularly on the client's side. \r\nThe Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption (HEE) protocol was developed to mitigate these issues. However, the susceptibility of HHE to strong attacks, specifically physical attacks, has been largely unexplored. \r\nWhile physical attacks like the Differential Fault Analysis (DFA) have proved very effective in the field of symmetric cryptography, prior works have largely relied on strong assumptions like nonce reuse, limiting their feasibility in a real-world setting.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we introduce a novel attack- SASTA, which presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first generalized analysis of HHE under DFA. Our analysis uncovers a significant limitation of the HHE protocol where a single fault leads to complete key recovery not only for the standard scheme-AES but also for the new HHE tailored Symmetric Encryption (SE) schemes -- RASTA, PASTA, MASTA, and HERA. We further extend SASTA to effectively target Authenticated Transciphering protocols. Unlike prior works, the key advantage of SASTA is that it does not require nonce reuse.\r\n\r\nWe demonstrate a proof-of-concept of our attack on an off-the-shelf  ATXmega128D4-AU microcontroller running HHE firmware and mount end-to-end key recovery attacks. Finally, we discuss conventional countermeasures to defend against SASTA. Our work highlights that despite HHE's advantages of improving performance and reducing communication overhead, further analysis of its security guarantees is required.",

    "abstract": "In today's systems, privacy is often at odds with utility: users that reveal little information about themselves get restricted functionality, and service providers mistrust them. In practice, systems tip to either full anonymity (e.g. Monero), or full utility (e.g. Bitcoin). Well-known cryptographic primitives for bridging this gap exist: anonymous credentials (AC) let users disclose a subset of their credentials' attributes, revealing to service providers \"just what they need\"; group signatures (GS) allow users to authenticate anonymously, to be de-anonymized \"just when deemed necessary\". However, these primitives are hard to deploy.\r\n\r\nCurrent AC and GS variants reach specific points in the privacy-utility tradeoff, which we point as counter-productive engineering-wise, as it requires full and error-prone re-engineering to adjust the tradeoff. Also, so far, GS and AC have been studied separately by theoretical research.\r\n\r\nWe take the first steps toward unifying and generalizing both domains, with the goal of bringing their benefits to practice, in a flexible way. We give a common model capturing their core properties, and use functional placeholders to subsume intermediate instantiations of the privacy-utility tradeoff under the same model. To prove its flexibility, we show how concrete variants of GS, AC (and others, like ring signatures) can be seen as special cases of our scheme \u2013 to which we refer as universal anonymous signatures (UAS). In practice, this means that instantiations following our construction can be configured to behave as variant X of a GS scheme, or as variant Y of an AC scheme, by tweaking a few functions.",

    "abstract": "The issue of data and information security on the internet and social network has become more serious and pervasive in recent years. Cryptography is used to solve security problems. However, message encryption cannot merely meet the intended goals because access control over the encrypted messages is required in some applications. To achieve these requirements, attribute-based encryption (ABE) is used. This type of encryption provides both security and access structure for the network users simultaneously. Fuzzy Identity-Based Encryption (FIBE) is a special mode of ABE that provides a threshold access structure for the users. This threshold value is set by the authority for users, which is always fixed and cannot be changed. So, the sender (encryptor) will not play a role in determining the threshold value. The mentioned issue exists also in Key Policy Attribute Based Encryption (KP-ABE) schemes. In this paper, we present a FIBE scheme in addition to the authority, the sender also plays a role in determining the threshold value. Thus, the policy will be more flexible than previous FIBE schemes in that the threshold value is selected only by the authority. We can call the proposed scheme a dual-policy ABE. The proposed technique for flexibility of threshold value can be applied in most of the existing KP-ABE schemes. We use the (indistinguishable) selective security model for security proof. The hardness assumption that we use is the modified bilinear decision Diffie-Hellman problem.",

    "abstract": "Garbling schemes allow to garble a circuit $C$ and an input $x$ such that $C(x)$ can be computed while hiding both $C$ and $x$. In the context of adaptive security, an adversary specifies the input to the circuit after seeing the garbled circuit, so that one can pre-process the garbling of $C$ and later only garble the input $x$ in the online phase. Since the online phase may be time-critical, it is an interesting question how much information needs to be transmitted in this phase and ideally, this should be close to $|x|$. Unfortunately, Applebaum, Ishai, Kushilevitz, and Waters (AIKW, CRYPTO 2013) show that for some circuits, specifically PRGs, achieving online complexity close to $|x|$ is impossible with simulation-based security, and Hub\u00e1\u010dek and Wichs (HW, ITCS 2015) show that online complexity of maliciously secure two-party computation needs to grow with the incompressibility entropy of the function. We thus seek to understand under which circumstances optimal online complexity is feasible despite these strong lower bounds.\r\nOur starting point is the observation that lower bounds (only) concern cryptographic circuits and that, when an embedded secret is not known to the adversary (distinguisher), then the lower bound techniques do not seem to apply. Our main contribution is distributional simulation-based security (DSIM), a framework for capturing weaker, yet meaningful simulation-based (adaptive) security which does not seem to suffer from impossibility results akin to AIKW. We show that DSIM can be used to prove security of a distributed symmetric encryption protocol built around garbling. We also establish a bootstrapping result from DSIM-security for $\\text{NC}^0$ circuits to DSIM-security for arbitrary polynomial-size circuits while preserving their online complexity.",

    "abstract": "Masking, an effective countermeasure against side-channel attacks, is commonly applied in modern cryptographic implementations. Considering cryptographic algorithms that utilize both Boolean and arithmetic masking, the conversion algorithm between arithmetic masking and Boolean masking is required. Conventional high-order arithmetic masking to Boolean masking conversion algorithms based on Boolean circuits suffer from performance overhead, especially in terms of hardware implementation. In this work, we analyze high latency for the conversion and propose an improved high-order A2B conversion algorithm. For the conversion of 16-bit variables, the hardware latency can be reduced by 47% in the best scenario. For the case study of second-order 32-bit conversion, the implementation results show that the improved scheme reduces the clock cycle latency by 42% in hardware and achieves a 30% speed performance improvement in software. Theoretically, a security proof of arbitrary order is provided for the proposed high-order A2B conversion. Experimental validations are performed to verify the second-order DPA resistance of second-order implementation. The Test Vector Leakage Assessment does not observe side-channel leakage for hardware and software implementations.",

    "abstract": "The rapid digitization of aviation communication and its dependent critical operations demand secure protocols that address domain-specific security requirements within the unique functional constraints of the aviation industry. These secure protocols must provide sufficient security against current and possible future attackers, given the inherent nature of the aviation community, that is highly complex and averse to frequent upgrades as well as its high safety and cost considerations. In this work we propose a pair of quantum-secure hybrid key exchange protocols (PQAG-KEM and PQAG-SIG) to secure communication between aircrafts in-flight and ground stations. PQAG-KEM leverages post-quantum and classical Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) to ensure the hybrid security of the protocol against classical as well as future quantum adversaries. PQAG-SIG, alternatively, uses quantum-safe digital signatures to achieve authentication security. We provide an implementation of both PQAG-KEM and PQAG-SIG, and compare favourably with current state-of- the-art secure avionic protocols. Finally, we provide a formal analysis of our new PQAG protocols in a strong hybrid key exchange framework.",

    "abstract": "ZK-SNARKs, a fundamental component of privacy-oriented payment systems, identity protocols, or anonymous voting systems, are advanced cryptographic protocols for verifiable computation: modern SNARKs allow to encode the invariants of a program, expressed as an arithmetic circuit, in an appropriate constraint language from which short, zero-knowledge proofs for correct computations can be constructed.\r\n\r\n  One of the most important computations that is run through SNARK systems is the verification of Merkle tree (MT) opening proofs, which relies on the evaluation of a fixed-input-length (FIL) cryptographic compression function over binary MTs. \r\n  As classical, bit-oriented hash functions like SHA-2 are not compactly representable in SNARK frameworks, Arithmetization-Oriented (AO) cryptographic designs have emerged as an alternative, efficient solution.\r\n  \r\n  Today, the majority of AO compression functions are built from the Sponge permutation-based hashing mode. \r\n  While this approach allows cost savings, compared to blockcipher-based modes, as it does not require key-scheduling, AO blockcipher schedulers are often cheap to compute. \r\n  Furthermore, classical bit-oriented cryptography has long studied how to construct provably secure compression functions from blockciphers, following the Preneel-Govaerts-Vandewalle (PGV) framework. \r\n  The potential efficiency gains together with the strong provable security foundations in the classic setting, motivate the study of AO blockcipher-based compression functions.\r\n  \r\n  In this work, we propose PGV-LC and PGV-ELC, two AO blockcipher-based FIL compression modes inspired by and extending the classical PGV approach, offering flexible input and output sizes and coming with provable security guarantees in the AO setting. \r\n  We prove the collision and preimage resistance in the ideal cipher model, and give bounds for collision and opening resistance over MTs of arbitrary arity.\r\n  \r\n  We compare experimentally the AO PGV-ELC mode over the Hades blockcipher with its popular and widely adopted Sponge instantiation, Poseidon, and its improved variant Poseidon2. \r\n  Our resulting constructions are up to \\(3\\times \\) faster than Poseidon and \\(2\\times \\) faster than Poseidon2 in native x86 execution, and up to \\(50\\% \\) faster in the Groth16 SNARK framework. \r\n  \r\n  Finally, we study the benefits of using MTs of arity wider than two, proposing a new strategy to obtain a compact R1CS constraint system in such case.\r\n  In fact, by combining an efficient parametrization of the Hades blockcipher over the PGV-ELC mode, together with an optimal choice of the MT arity, we measured an improvement of up to \\(9\\times \\) in native MT construction time, and up to \\(2.5\\times \\) in proof generation time, compared to Poseidon over binary MTs.",

    "abstract": "Differential privacy is a fundamental concept for protecting individual privacy in databases while enabling data analysis. Conceptually, it is assumed that the adversary has no direct access to the database, and therefore, encryption is not necessary. However, with the emergence of cloud computing and the \u00abon-cloud\u00bb storage of vast databases potentially contributed by multiple parties, it is becoming increasingly necessary to consider the possibility of the adversary having (at least partial) access to sensitive databases. A consequence is that, to protect the on-line database, it is now necessary to employ encryption. At PoPETs'19, it was the first time that the notion of differential privacy was considered for encrypted databases, but only for a limited type of query, namely histograms. Subsequently, a new type of query, summation, was considered at CODASPY'22. These works achieve statistical differential privacy, by still assuming that the adversary has no access to the encrypted database.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we argue that it is essential to assume that the adversary may eventually access the encrypted data, rendering statistical differential privacy inadequate. Therefore, the appropriate privacy notion for encrypted databases that we use is computational differential privacy, which was introduced by Beimel et al. at CRYPTO '08. In our work, we focus on the case of functional encryption, which is an extensively studied primitive permitting some authorized computation over encrypted data. \r\n\r\nTechnically, we show that any randomized functional encryption scheme that satisfies simulation-based security and differential privacy of the output can achieve computational differential privacy for multiple queries to one database. Our work also extends the summation query to a much broader range of queries, specifically linear queries, by utilizing inner-product functional encryption. Hence, we provide an instantiation for inner-product functionalities by proving its simulation soundness and present a concrete randomized inner-product functional encryption with computational differential privacy against multiple queries. In term of efficiency, our protocol is almost as practical as the underlying inner product functional encryption scheme. As evidence, we provide a full benchmark, based on our concrete implementation for databases with up to 1 000 000 entries. Our work can be considered as a step towards achieving privacy-preserving encrypted databases for a wide range of query types and considering the involvement of multiple database owners.",

    "abstract": "Side-channel analysis based on machine learning, especially neural networks, has gained significant attention in recent years. However, many existing methods still suffer from certain limitations. Despite the inherent capability of neural networks to extract features, there remains a risk of extracting irrelevant information. The heavy reliance on profiled traces makes it challenging to adapt to remote attack scenarios with limited profiled traces. Besides, attack traces also contain critical information that can be used in the training process to assist model learning. In this paper, we propose a side-channel analysis approach based on contrastive learning named CL-SCA to address these issues. We also leverage a stochastic data augmentation technique to assist model to effectively filter out irrelevant information from the profiled traces. Through experiments of different datasets from different platforms, we demonstrate that CL-SCA significantly outperforms various conventional machine learning side-channel analysis techniques. Moreover, by incorporating attack traces into the training process using our approach, known as CL-SCA+, it becomes possible to achieve even greater enhancements. This extension can further improve the effectiveness of key recovery, which is fully verified through experiments on different datasets.",

    "abstract": "Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), a cryptographic tool known for decades, have gained significant attention in recent years due to advancements that have made them practically applicable in real-world scenarios. ZKPs can provide unique attributes, such as succinctness, non-interactivity, and the ability to prove knowledge without revealing the information itself, making them an attractive solution for a range of applications. \r\n\r\nThis paper aims to critically analyze the applicability of ZKPs in various scenarios. We categorize ZKPs into distinct types: SNARKs (Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge), Commit-then-Prove ZKPs, MPC-in-the-Head, and Sigma Protocols, each offering different trade-offs and benefits. We introduce a flowchart methodology to assist in determining the most suitable ZKP system, given a set of technical application requirements. Next, we conduct an in-depth investigation of three major use cases: Outsourcing Computation, Digital Self-Sovereign Identity, and ZKPs in networking. Additionally, we provide a high-level overview of other applications of ZKPs, exploring their broader implications and opportunities. This paper aims to demystify the decision-making process involved in choosing the right ZKP system, providing clarity on when and how these cryptographic tools can be effectively utilized in various domains \u2014 and when they are better to be avoided.",

    "abstract": "Higher order differential properties constitute a very insightful tool at the hands\r\nof a cryptanalyst allowing for probing a cryptographic primitive from an algebraic perspective. In FSE 2017, Saha et al. reported SymSum (referred to as\r\nSymSum_Vec in this paper), a new distinguisher based on higher order vectorial\r\nBoolean derivatives of SHA-3, constituting one of the best distinguishers on the\r\nlatest cryptographic hash standard. SymSum_Vec exploits the difference in the\r\nalgebraic degree of highest degree monomials in the algebraic normal form of\r\nSHA-3 with regards to their dependence on round constants. Later in Africacrypt\r\n2020, Suryawanshi et al. extended SymSum_Vec using linearization techniques and\r\nin SSS 2023 also applied it to NIST-LWC finalist Xoodyak. However, a major\r\nlimitation of SymSum_Vec is the maximum attainable derivative (MAD) which is\r\nless than half of the widely studied ZeroSum distinguisher. This is attributed\r\nto SymSum_Vec being dependent on m\u2212fold vectorial derivatives while ZeroSum\r\nrelies on m\u2212fold simple derivatives. In this work we overcome this limitation\r\nof SymSum_Vec by developing and validating the theory of computing SymSum_Vec\r\nwith simple derivatives. This gives us a close to 100% improvement in the MAD\r\nthat can be computed. The new distinguisher reported in this work can also be combined with one/two-round linearization to penetrate more rounds. Moreover, we identify an issue with the two-round linearization claim made by Suryawanshi et al. which renders it invalid and also furnish an algebraic fix at the cost of some additional constraints. \r\n\r\nCombining all results we report SymSum_Sim , a new variant of the SymSum_Vec\r\ndistinguisher based on m\u2212fold simple derivatives that outperforms ZeroSum by\r\na factor of $2^{257}$, $2^{129}$ for 10-round SHA-3-384 and 9-round SHA-3-512 respectively while enjoying the same MAD as ZeroSum. For every other SHA-3 variant,\r\nSymSum_Sim maintains an advantage of factor 2. Combined with one/two-round\r\nlinearization, SymSum_Sim improves upon all existing ZeroSum and SymSum_Vec\r\ndistinguishers on both SHA-3 and Xoodyak. As regards Keccak-p, the internal\r\npermutation of SHA-3, we report the best 15-round distinguisher with a complexity of $2^{256}$ and the first better than birthday-bound 16-round distinguisher with\r\na complexity of $2^{512}$ (improving upon the 15/16-round results by Guo et al. in\r\nAsiacrypt 2016). We also devise the best full-round distinguisher on the Xoodoo\r\ninternal permutation of Xoodyak with a practically verifiable complexity of $2^{32}$\r\nand furnish the first third-party distinguishers on the Belarushian hash function\r\nBash. All distinguishers furnished in this work have been verified through implementations whenever practically viable. Overall, with the MAD barrier broken,\r\nSymSum_Sim emerges as a better distinguisher than ZeroSum on all fronts and\r\nadds to the state-of-the-art of cryptanalytic tools investigating non-randomness\r\nof crypto primitives.",

    "abstract": "All anonymous identity-based encryption (IBE) schemes that are group homomorphic (to the best of our knowledge) require knowledge of the identity to compute the homomorphic operation. This paper is motivated by this open problem, namely to construct an anonymous group-homomorphic IBE scheme that does not sacrifice anonymity to perform homomorphic operations. Note that even when strong assumptions such as indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) are permitted, no schemes are known. We succeed in solving this open problem by assuming iO and the hardness of the DBDH problem over rings (specifically, $Z_{N^2}$ for RSA modulus $N$). We then use the existence of such a scheme to construct an IBE scheme with re-randomizable anonymous encryption keys, which we prove to be IND-ID-RCCA secure. Finally, we use our results to construct identity-based anonymous aggregation protocols.",

    "abstract": "Asymmetric Searchable Encryption (ASE) is a promising cryptographic mechanism that enables a semi-trusted cloud server to perform keyword searches over encrypted data for users. To be useful, an ASE scheme must support expressive search queries, which are expressed as conjunction, disjunction, or any Boolean formulas. In this paper, we propose a fast and expressive ASE scheme that is adaptively secure, called FEASE. It requires only 3 pairing operations for searching any conjunctive set of keywords independent of the set size and has linear complexity for encryption and trapdoor algorithms in the number of keywords. \r\n\r\nFEASE is based on a new fast Anonymous Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (A-KP-ABE) scheme as our first proposal, which is of independent interest. To address optional protection against keyword guessing attacks, we extend FEASE into the first expressive Public-Key Authenticated Encryption with Keyword Search (PAEKS) scheme. \r\n\r\nWe provide implementations and evaluate the performance of all three schemes, while also comparing them with the state of the art. We observe that FEASE outperforms all existing expressive ASE constructions and that our A-KP-ABE scheme offers anonymity with efficiency comparable to the currently fastest yet non-anonymous KP-ABE schemes FAME (ACM CCS 2017) and FABEO (ACM CCS 2022).",

    "abstract": "Proxy re-encryption (PRE) allows a proxy to transform a ciphertext intended for Alice (delegator) to another ciphertext intended for Bob (delegatee) without revealing the underlying message. Recently, a new variant of PRE, namely fine-grained PRE (FPRE), was proposed in [Zhou et al., Asiacrypt 2023]. Generally, FPRE is designed for a function family F: each re-encryption key rk_{A\u2192B}^f is associated with a function f \u2208 F, and with rk_{A\u2192B}^f, a proxy can transform Alice's ciphertext encrypting m to Bob's ciphertext encrypting f(m). However, their scheme only supports single-hop re-encryption and achieves only CPA security.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we formalize multi-hop FPRE (mFPRE) that supports multi-hop re-encryptions in the fine-grained setting, and propose two mFPRE schemes achieving CPA security and stronger HRA security (security against honest re-encryption attacks), respectively.\r\n \r\n-- For multi-hop FPRE, we formally define its syntax and formalize a set of security notions including CPA security, HRA security, undirectionality and ciphertext unlinkablity. HRA security is stronger and more reasonable than CPA security, and ciphertext unlinkablity blurs the proxy relations among a chain of multi-hop re-encryptions, hence providing better privacy. We establish the relations between these security notions.\r\n \r\n-- Our mFPRE schemes support fine-grained re-encryptions for bounded linear functions and have security based on the learning-with-errors (LWE) assumption in the standard model. In particular, one of our schemes is HRA secure and enjoys all the aforementioned desirable securities. To achieve CPA security and HRA security for mFPRE, we extend the framework of [Jafargholi et al., Crypto 2017] and the technique of the [Fuchsbauer et al., PKC 2019].",

    "abstract": "The polynomial attacks on SIDH by Castryck, Decru, Maino, Martindale and Robert have shown that, while the general isogeny problem is still considered unfeasible to break, it is possible to efficiently compute a secret isogeny when given its degree and image on enough torsion points.\r\nA natural response from many researchers has been to propose SIDH variants where one or both of these possible extra pieces of information is masked in order to obtain schemes for which a polynomial attack is not currently known. Example of such schemes are M-SIDH, MD-SIDH and FESTA.\r\nHowever, by themselves, theses SIDH variants are vulnerable to the same adaptive attacks where the adversary sends public keys whose associated isogeny is either unknown or inexistent. For the original SIDH scheme, one possible defense against these attacks is to use zero-knowledge proofs that a secret isogeny has been honestly computed. However, such proofs do not currently exist for most SIDH variants.\r\nIn this paper, we present new zero-knowledge proofs for isogenies whose degree or torsion points have been masked. The security of these proofs mainly relies on the hardness of DSSP.",

    "abstract": "Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic primitive that enables a prover to convince a verifier that a statement is true, without revealing any other information beyond the correctness of the statement itself. Due to its powerful capabilities, its most practical type, called zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledge (zkSNARK), has been widely deployed in various privacy preserving applications such as cryptocurrencies and verifiable computation. Although state-of-the-art zkSNARKs are highly efficient for the verifier, the computational overhead for the prover is still orders of magnitude too high to warrant use in many applications. This overhead arises from several time-consuming operations, including large-scale matrix-vector multiplication (MUL), number-theoretic transform (NTT), and especially the multi-scalar multiplication (MSM) which constitutes the largest proportion. Therefore, further efficiency improvements are needed.\r\n\r\n  In this paper, we focus on comprehensive optimization of running time and storage space required by the MSM algorithm on GPUs. Specifically, we propose a novel, modular and adaptive parameter configuration technique\u2014elastic MSM to enable us to adjust the scale of MSM according to our own wishes by performing a corresponding amount of preprocessing. This technique enables us to fully unleash the potential of various efficient parallel MSM algorithms. We have implemented and tested elastic MSM over three prevailing parallel Pippenger algorithms on GPUs. Across various preprocessing space limitations (across various MSM scales), our constructions achieve up to about 1.90\u00d7, 1.08\u00d7 and 1.36\u00d7 (2.58\u00d7, 1.39\u00d7 and 1.91\u00d7) speedup versus three state-of-the-art parallel Pippenger algorithms on GPUs, respectively.\r\n\r\n  From another perspective, elastic MSM could also be regarded as a preprocessing technique over the well-known Pippenger algorithm, which is modular and could be used to accelerate almost all the most advanced parallel Pippenger algorithms on GPUs. Meanwhile, elastic MSM provides an adaptive trade-off between the running time and the extra storage space needed by parallel Pippenger algorithms on GPUs. This is the first preprocessing technique to retain the improved MSM computation brought by preprocessing under varying storage space limitations. Specifically, across various preprocessing space limitations (across various MSM scales), our constructions achieve up to about 192\u00d7 and 223\u00d7 (159\u00d7 and 174\u00d7) speedup versus two state-of-the-art preprocessing parallel Pippenger algorithms on GPUs, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The selection of a Lightweight Cryptography (LWC) algorithm is crucial for resource limited applications. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) leads this process, which involves a thorough evaluation of the algorithms\u2019 cryptanalytic strength. Furthermore, careful consideration is given to factors such as algorithm latency, code size, and hardware implementation area. These factors are critical in determining the overall performance of cryptographic solutions at edge devices. Introducing CrISA-X, a Cryptography Instruction Set Architecture extensions designed to improve cryptographic latency on extendable processors. CrISA-X, classified as Generic-Atomic, Block-Specific and Procedure-Specific, leverages RISC processor hardware and a base ISA to effectively execute LWC algorithms. Our study aims to evaluate the execution efficiency of new single-cycle instruction extensions and tightly coupled multicycle instructions on extendable modular RISC processors. CrISA-X provides enhanced speed of various algorithms simultaneously while optimizing ISA adaptability, a feat yet to be accomplished. The extension, diverse for several computation levels, is first specifically tailored for individual algorithms and sets of LWC algorithms, depending on performance, frequency, and area trade-offs. By diligently applying the Min-Max optimization technique, we have configured these extensions to achieve a delicate balance between performance, area code size, etc. Our study presents empirical evidence of the performance enhancement achieved on a real synthesis modular RISC processor. We offer a framework for creating optimized processor hardware and ISA extensions. The CrISA-X framework generally outperforms ISA extensions by delivering significant performance boosts between 3x to 17x while experiencing a relative area cost increase of +12% and +47% in LUTs, in respect to the instruction set category. Notably, as one important example, the utilization of the ASCON algorithm yields a 10x performance boost in contrast to the base ISA instruction implementation",

    "abstract": "NIST released the draft standard for ML-KEM, and we can expect its widespread use in the embedded world in the near future. Several side-channel attacks have been proposed, and one line of research has focused on attacks against the comparison step of the FO-transform. A work published at TCHES 2022 stressed the need for secure higher-order masked comparisons beyond the $t$-probing model and proposed a higher-order masked comparison method. Subsequently, D'Anvers, Van Beirendonck, and Verbauwhede improved upon the performance of several previous proposals; their higher-order masked algorithm currently achieves the highest performance for masked comparisons.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we show that while this proposal is secure in the $t$-probing model, its security in practice is questionable. We first propose an approximate template attack that requires only a small number of traces for profiling and has an exceptionally high noise tolerance. We demonstrate that, without knowledge of the targeted values, a vertical analysis of the distribution of certain points of interest can replace the profiling phase. Finally, we explain how a decryption failure oracle may be constructed from a single trace.\r\n\r\nWe prove that these attacks are not affected by higher masking orders for noise levels that by far prevent previous profiled attacks on ML-KEM. Further, we provide simulations showing that even under extreme noise levels, the attacks are not prevented by realistic masking orders. Additionally, we carry out the attacks on multiple physical devices to stress the practicality of our attack. We discuss the underlying causes for our attack, demonstrate the difficulty of securing the FO-transform in ML-KEM, draw conclusions about the (in-)sufficiency of $t$-probing security in this context, and highlight an open gap in securing ML-KEM on embedded devices.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on the common prime RSA variant and introduces a novel investigation into the partial key exposure attack targeting it. We explore the vulnerability of this RSA variant, which employs two common primes $p$ and $q$ defined as $p=2ga+1$ and $q=2gb+1$ for a large prime $g$. Previous cryptanalysis of common prime RSA has primarily focused on the small private key attack. In our work, we delve deeper into the realm of partial key exposure attacks by categorizing them into three distinct cases. We are able to identify weak private keys that are susceptible to partial key exposure by using the lattice-based method for solving simultaneous modular univariate linear equations. To validate the effectiveness and soundness of our proposed attacks, we conduct experimental evaluations. Through these examinations, we demonstrate the validity and practicality of the proposed partial key exposure attacks on common prime RSA.",

    "abstract": "In 2016, NIST announced an open competition with the goal of finding and standardizing a suitable quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithm, with the standard to be drafted in 2023. These algorithms aim to implement post-quantum secure key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) and digital signatures. However, the proposed algorithm does not consider authentication and is vulnerable to attacks such as man-in-the-middle. In this paper, we propose an authenticated key exchange algorithm to solve the above problems and improve its usability. The proposed algorithm combines learning with errors (LWE) and elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem to provide the required security goals. As forward security is a desirable property in a key exchange protocol, an ephemeral key pair is designed that a long-term secret compromise does not affect the security of past session keys.  Moreover, the exchange steps required by the algorithm are very streamlined and can be completed with only two handshakes.  We also use the random oracle model to prove the correctness and the security of proposed scheme. The performance analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. We believe that the novel approach introduced in this algorithm opens several doors for innovative applications of digital signatures in KEMs.",

    "abstract": "Hashing algorithms are one-way functions that are used in cryptographic protocols as Pseudo Random Functions (PRF), to assess data integrity or to create a Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC). In many cryptographic constructions, secret data is processed with hashing functions. In these cases, recovering the input given to the hashing algorithm allows retrieving secret data. In this paper, we investigate the application of Soft Analytical Side-Channel Attacks (SASCA), based on a Belief Propagation (BP) framework, to recover the input of two popular hash function families: SHA-2 and SHA-3. Thanks to a simulation framework, we develop a comprehensive study of the attacker's recovery capacity depending on the hash function variant. Then, we demonstrate that an attacker can leverage prior knowledge on the hashing function input to increase the effectiveness of the attacks. As an example, in the context of a bootloader doing a hash-based integrity check on a secret firmware, we show that simple statistics on assembly code injected in BP improves input recovery. Finally, we study the security implications of SASCA on cryptosystems performing multiple invocations of hashing functions with inputs derived from the same secret data. We show that such constructions can be exploited efficiently by an attacker. We support such statements with experiments on SHA-256 based HMAC and on SHAKE-256 based PRF in Kyber's encryption routine. We also show that increasing Kyber's security parameters implies weaker security against the proposed SASCA targeting the shared key.",

    "abstract": "When designing filter functions in Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR) based stream ciphers, algebraic criteria of Boolean functions such as the Algebraic Immunity (AI) become key characteristics because they guarantee the security of ciphers against the powerful algebraic attacks. In this article, we investigate a generalization of the algebraic attacks proposed by Courtois and Meier on filtered LFSR twenty years ago. We consider how the standard algebraic attack can be generalized beyond filtered LFSR to stream ciphers applying a Boolean filter function to an updated state. Depending on the updating process, we can use different sets of annihilators than the ones used in the standard algebraic attack; it leads to a generalization of the concept of algebraic immunity, and more efficient attacks. To illustrate these strategies, we focus on one of these generalizations and introduce a new notion called Extreme Algebraic Immunity (EAI).\r\n\r\nWe perform a theoretic study of the EAI criterion and explore its relation to other algebraic criteria. We prove the upper bound of the EAI of an n-variable Boolean function and further show that the EAI can be lower bounded by the AI restricted to a subset, as defined by Carlet, M\u00e9aux and Rotella at FSE 2017. We also exhibit functions with EAI guaranteed to be lower than the AI, in particular we highlight a pathological case of functions with optimal algebraic immunity and EAI only n/4. As applications, we determine the EAI of filter functions of some existing stream ciphers and discuss how extreme algebraic attacks using EAI could apply to some ciphers. \r\n\r\nOur generalized algebraic attack does not give a better complexity than Courtois and Meier's result on the existing stream ciphers. However, we see this work as a study to avoid weaknesses in the construction of future stream cipher designs.",

    "abstract": "Money laundering is a serious financial crime where criminals aim to conceal the illegal source of their money via a series of transactions. Although banks have an obligation to monitor transactions, it is difficult to track these illicit money flows since they typically span over multiple banks, which cannot share this information due to privacy concerns. We present secure risk propagation, a novel efficient algorithm for money laundering detection across banks without violating privacy concerns. In this algorithm, each account is assigned a risk score, which is then propagated through the transaction network. In this article we present two results. Firstly, using data from a large Dutch bank, we show that it is possible to detect unusual activity using this model, with cash ratio as the risk score. With a recall of 20%, the precision improves from 15% to 40% by propagating the risk scores, reducing the number of false positives significantly. Secondly, we present a privacy-preserving solution for securely performing risk propagation over a joint, inter-bank transaction network. To achieve this, we use Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) techniques, which are particularly well-suited for the risk propagation algorithm due to its structural simplicity. We also show that the running time of this secure variant scales linearly in the amount of accounts and transactions. For 200, 000 transactions, two iterations of the secure algorithm between three virtual parties, run within three hours on a consumer-grade server.",

    "abstract": "This paper questions the side-channel security of central reduction technique, which is widely adapted in efficient implementations of Lattice-Based Cryptography (LBC). We show that the central reduction leads to a vulnerability by creating a strong dependency between the power consumption and the sign of sensitive intermediate values. We exploit this dependency by introducing the novel absolute value prediction function, which can be employed in higher-order non-profiled multi-query Side-Channel Analysis (SCA) attacks. Our results reveal that \u2013 compared to classical reduction algorithms \u2013 employing the central reduction scheme leads to a two-orders-of-magnitude decrease in the number of required SCA measurements to exploit secrets of masked implementations. We particularly show that our approach is valid for the prime moduli employed by Kyber and Dilithium, the lattice-based post-quantum algorithms selected by NIST. We practically evaluate our introduced approach by performing second-order non-profiled attacks against an open-source masked implementation of Kyber on an ARM Cortex-M4 micro-processor. In our experiments, we revealed the full secret key of the aforementioned masked implementation with only 250 power traces without any forms of profiling or choosing the ciphertexts.",

    "abstract": "Recently, researchers have proposed many LWE estimators, such as lattice-estimator (Albrecht et al, Asiacrypt 2017) and leaky-LWE-Estimator (Dachman-Soled et al, Crypto 2020), while the latter has already been used in estimating the security level of Kyber and Dilithium using only BKZ. However, we prove in this paper that solving LWE by combining a lattice reduction step (by LLL or BKZ) and a\r\ntarget vector searching step (by enumeration or sieving), which we call a Two-step mode, is more efficient than using only BKZ. \r\n    Moreover, we give a refined LWE estimator in Two-step mode by analyzing the relationship between the probability distribution of the target vector and the solving success rate in a Two-step mode LWE solving algorithm. While the latest Two-step estimator for LWE, which is the \u201cprimal-bdd\u201d mode in lattice-estimator1, does not take into account some up-to-date results and lacks a thorough theoretical analysis. Under the same gate-count model, our estimation for NIST PQC standards drops by 2.1\u223c3.4 bits (2.2\u223c4.6 bits while considering more flexible blocksize and jump strategy) compared with leaky-LWE-Estimator.\r\n    Furthermore, we also give a conservative estimation for LWE from the Two-step solving algorithm. Compared with the Core-SVP model, which is used in previous conservative estimations, our estimation relies on weaker assumptions and outputs higher evaluation results than the Core-\r\nSVP model. For NIST PQC standards, our conservative estimation is 4.17\u223c8.11 bits higher than the Core-SVP estimation. Hence our estimator can give a closer estimation for both upper bound and lower bound of LWE hardness.",

    "abstract": "Laconic function evaluation (LFE) is a \"flipped\" version of fully homomorphic encryption, where the server performing the computation gets the output. The server commits itself to a function $f$ by outputting a small digest. Clients can later efficiently encrypt inputs $x$ with respect to the digest in much less time than computing $f$, and ensure that the server only decrypts $f(x)$, but does not learn anything else about $x$. Prior works constructed LFE for circuits under LWE, and for Turing Machines (TMs) from indistinguishability obfuscation (iO).  In this work we introduce  LFE for Random-Access Machines (RAM-LFE). The server commits itself to a potentially huge database $y$ via a short digest. Clients can later efficiently encrypt inputs $x$ with respect to the digest and  the server decrypts $f(x,y)$ for some specified RAM program $f$ (e.g., a universal RAM), without learning anything else about $x$. The main advantage of RAM-LFE is that the server's decryption run-time  only scales with the RAM run-time $T$ of the computation $f(x,y)$, which can be sublinear in both $|x|$ and $|y|$. We consider a weakly efficient variant, where the client's run-time is also allowed to scale linearly with $T$, but not $|y|$,  and a fully efficient variant, where the client's run-time must be sublinear in both $T$ and $|y|$. We construct the former from doubly efficient private information retrieval (DEPIR) and laconic OT (LOT), both of which are known from RingLWE, and the latter from  an additional use of iO. We then show how to leverage fully efficient RAM-LFE to also get (many-key) functional encryption for RAMs (RAM-FE) where secret keys are associate with big databases $y$  and the decryption time is sublinear in $|y|$, as well as iO for RAMs where the obfuscated program contains a big database $y$ and the evaluation time is sublinear in $|y|$.",

    "abstract": "This work presents the first hardware realisation of the Syndrome-Decoding-in-the-Head (SDitH) signature scheme, which is a candidate in the NIST PQC process for standardising post-quantum secure digital signature schemes. SDitH's hardness is based on conservative code-based assumptions, and it uses the Multi-Party-Computation-in-the-Head (MPCitH) construction.\r\nThis is the first hardware design of a code-based signature scheme based on traditional decoding problems and only the second for MPCitH constructions, after Picnic. This work presents optimised designs to achieve the best area efficiency, which we evaluate using the Time-Area Product (TAP) metric. This work also proposes a novel hardware architecture by dividing the signature generation algorithm into two phases, namely offline and online phases for optimising the overall clock cycle count. The hardware designs for key generation, signature generation, and signature verification are parameterised for all SDitH parameters, including the NIST security levels, both syndrome decoding base fields (GF256 and GF251), and thus conforms to the SDitH specifications. The hardware design further supports secret share splitting, and the hypercube optimisation which can be applied in this and multiple other NIST PQC candidates. \r\nThe results of this work result in a hardware design with a drastic reducing in clock cycles compared to the optimised AVX2 software implementation, in the range of 2-4x for most operations. Our key generation outperforms software drastically, giving a 11-17x reduction in runtime, despite the significantly faster clock speed. On Artix 7 FPGAs we can perform key generation in 55.1 Kcycles, signature generation in 6.7 Mcycles, and signature verification in 8.6 Mcycles for NIST L1 parameters, which increase for GF251, and for L3 and L5 parameters.",

    "abstract": "Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)  has been widely used in accelerating computations in lattice-based cryptography.  However, attackers can potentially launch power analysis targeting NTT because it is usually the most time-consuming part of the implementation. This extended time frame provides a natural window of opportunity for attackers. In this paper, we investigate the first CPU  frequency leakage (Hertzbleed-like) attacks against  NTT in lattice-based KEMs. Our key observation is that different inputs to NTT incur different Hamming weights in its output and intermediate layers.  By measuring the CPU frequency during the execution of NTT, we propose a simple yet effective attack idea to find the input to NTT that triggers NTT processing data with significantly low Hamming weight. We further apply our attack idea to real-world applications that are built upon NTT: CPA-secure Kyber without Compression and Decompression functions, and CCA-secure NTTRU. This leads us to extract information or frequency Hints about the secret key.  Integrating these Hints into the  LWE-estimator framework, we estimate a minimum of $35\\%$ security loss caused by the leakage. The frequency and timing measurements on the Reference and AVX2 implementations of NTT in both Kyber and NTTRU align well with our theoretical analysis, confirming the existence of frequency side-channel leakage in NTT. It is important to emphasize that our observation is not limited to a specific implementation but rather the algorithm on which NTT is based. Therefore, our results call for more attention to the analysis of power leakage against NTT in lattice-based cryptography.",

    "abstract": "The past years have witnessed a considerable increase in research efforts put into neural network-assisted profiled side-channel analysis (SCA). Studies have also identified challenges, e.g., closing the gap between metrics for machine learning (ML) classification and side-channel attack evaluation. In fact, in the context of NN-assisted SCA, the NN\u2019s output distribution forms the basis for successful key recovery. In this respect, related work has covered various aspects of integrating neural networks (NNs) into SCA, including applying a diverse set of NN models, model selection and training, hyperparameter tuning, etc. Nevertheless, one well-known fact has been overlooked in the SCA-related literature, namely NNs\u2019 tendency to become \u201cover-confident,\u201d i.e., suffering from an overly high probability of correctness when predicting the correct class (secret key in the sense of SCA). Temperature scaling is among the powerful and effective techniques that have been devised as a remedy for this. Regarding the principles of deep learning, it is known that temperature scaling does not affect the NN\u2019s accuracy; however, its impact on metrics for secret key recovery, mainly guessing entropy, is worth investigating. This paper reintroduces temperature scaling into SCA and demonstrates that key recovery can become more effective through that. Interestingly, temperature scaling can be easily integrated into SCA, and no re-tuning of the network is needed. In doing so, temperature can be seen as a metric to assess the NN\u2019s performance before launching the attack. In this regard, the impact of hyperparameter tuning, network variance, and capacity have been studied. This leads to recommendations on how network miscalibration and overconfidence can be prevented.",

    "abstract": "A universal circuit (UC) can be thought of as a programmable circuit that can simulate any circuit up to a certain size by specifying its secret configuration bits. UCs have been incorporated into various applications, such as private function evaluation (PFE). Recently, studies have attempted to formalize the concept of semiconductor intellectual property (IP) protection in the context of UCs. This is despite the observations made in theory and practice that, in reality, the adversary may obtain additional information about the secret when executing cryptographic protocols. This paper aims to answer the question of whether UCs leak information unintentionally, which can be leveraged by the adversary to disclose the configuration bits. In this regard, we propose the first photon emission analysis against UCs relying on computer vision-based approaches. We demonstrate that the adversary can utilize a cost-effective solution to take images to be processed by off-the-shelf algorithms to extract configuration bits. We examine the efficacy of our method in two scenarios: (1) the design is small enough to be captured in a single image during the attack phase, and (2) multiple images should be captured to launch the attack by deploying a divide-and-conquer strategy. To evaluate the effectiveness of our attack, we use metrics commonly applied in side-channel analysis, namely rank and success rate. By doing so, we show that our profiled photon emission analysis achieves a success rate of 1 by employing a few templates (concretely, only 18 images were used as templates).",

    "abstract": "Decentralized applications (DApps), which are innovative blockchain-powered software systems designed to serve as the fundamental building blocks for the next generation of Internet services, have witnessed exponential growth in recent years. This paper thoroughly compares and analyzes two blockchain-based decentralized storage networks (DSNs), which are crucial foundations for DApp and blockchain ecosystems. The study examines their respective mechanisms for data persistence, strategies for enforcing data retention, and token economics. In addition to delving into technical details, the suitability of each storage solution for decentralized application development is assessed, taking into consideration network performance, storage costs, and existing use cases. By evaluating these factors, the paper aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of these technologies in supporting the desirable properties of truly decentralized blockchain applications. In conclusion, the findings of this research are discussed and synthesized, offering valuable perspectives on the capabilities of these technologies. It sheds light on their potential to facilitate the development of DApps and provides an understanding of the ongoing trends in blockchain development.",

    "abstract": "We propose a solution for user privacy-oriented privacy-preserving data aggregation with multiple data customers. Most existing state-of-the-art approaches present too much importance on performance efficiency and seem to ignore privacy properties except for input privacy. Most solutions for data aggregation do not generally discuss the users\u2019 birthright, namely their privacy for their own data control and anonymity when they search for something on the browser or volunteer to participate in a survey. Still, they are ambitious to secure data customers\u2019 rights (which should come later). They focus on resulting in an efficiency-oriented data aggregation enabling input privacy only. We aim to give importance to user privacy, and we have designed a solution for data aggregation in which we keep efficiency in balance. We show that PRIDA provides a good level of computational and communication complexities and is even better in timing evaluation than existing studies published recently (i.e., Bonawitz et al. (CCS\u201917), Corrigan-Gibbs et al. (NSDI\u201917), Bell et al. (CCS\u201920), Addanki et al. (SCN\u201922)). We employ threshold homomorphic encryption and secure two-party computation to ensure privacy properties. We balance the trade-off between a proper design for users and the desired privacy and efficiency.",

Our circuit zero-knowledge protocol has concretely better proof/prover/verifier complexity compared to the the state-of-the-art protocol in the updatable setting under the same assumption. Our techniques of achieving verifier-succinctness in the compression framework is of independent interest.\r\n\r\nWe then show a commitment scheme for committing to group elements using a structured commitment key. We construct protocols to open a committed homomorphism on a committed vector with verifier succinctness in the designated verifier setting. This has applications in making the verifier in compressed sigma protocols for bilinear group arithmetic circuits, succinct.",

    "abstract": "BIKE is a post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) selected for the 4th round of the NIST\u2019s standardization campaign. It relies on the hardness of the syndrome decoding problem for quasi-cyclic codes and on the indistinguishability of the public key from a random element, and provides the most competitive performance among round 4 candidates, which makes it relevant for future real-world use cases. Analyzing its side-channel resistance has been highly encouraged by the community and several works have already outlined various side-channel weaknesses and proposed ad-hoc countermeasures. However, in contrast to the well-documented research line on masking lattice-based algorithms, the possibility of generically protecting code-based algorithms by masking has only been marginally studied in a 2016 paper by Cong Chen et al. At this stage of the standardization campaign, it is important to assess the possibility of fully masking BIKE scheme and the resulting cost in terms of performances.\r\nIn this work, we provide the first high-order masked implementation of a code-based algorithm. We had to tackle many issues such as finding proper ways to handle large sparse polynomials, masking the key-generation algorithm or keeping the benefit of the bitslicing. In this paper, we present all the gadgets necessary to provide a fully masked implementation of BIKE, we discuss our different implementation choices and we propose a full proof of masking in the Ishai Sahai and Wagner (Crypto 2003) model.\r\nMore practically, we also provide an open C-code masked implementation of the key-generation, encapsulation and decapsulation algorithms with extensive benchmarks. While the obtained performance is slower than existing masked lattice-based algorithms, the scaling in the masking order is still encouraging and no Boolean to Arithmetic conversion has been used.\r\nWe hope that this work can be a starting point for future analysis and optimization.",

    "abstract": "Software obfuscation is a powerful tool to protect the intellectual property or secret keys inside programs. Strong software obfuscation is crucial in the context of untrusted execution environments (e.g., subject to malware infection) or to face potentially malicious users trying to reverse-engineer a sensitive program. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art of pure software-based obfuscation (including white-box cryptography) is either insecure or infeasible in practice.\r\n\r\nThis work introduces OBSCURE, a versatile framework for practical and cryptographically strong software obfuscation relying on a simple stateless secure element (to be embedded, for example, in a protected hardware chip or a token). Based on the foundational result by Goyal et al. from TCC 2010, our scheme enjoys provable security guarantees, and further focuses on practical aspects, such as efficient execution of the obfuscated programs, while maintaining simplicity of the secure element. In particular, we propose a new rectangular universalization technique, which is also of independent interest. We provide an implementation of OBSCURE taking as input a program source code written in a subset of the C programming language. This ensures usability and a broad range of applications of our framework. We benchmark the obfuscation on simple software programs as well as on cryptographic primitives, hence highlighting the possible use cases of the framework as an alternative to pure software-based white-box implementations.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the number of third-party services that can access highly-sensitive data has increased steadily, e.g., in the financial sector, in eGovernment applications, or in high-assurance identity services. Protocols that enable this access must provide strong security guarantees.\r\n\r\nA prominent and widely employed protocol for this purpose is the OpenID Foundation's FAPI protocol. The FAPI protocol is already in widespread use, e.g., as part of the UK's Open Banking standards and Brazil's Open Banking Initiative as well as outside of the financial sector, for instance, as part of the Australian government's Consumer Data Rights standards.\r\n\r\nBased on lessons learned from FAPI 1.0, the OpenID Foundation has developed a completely new protocol, called FAPI 2.0. The specifications of FAPI 2.0 include a concrete set of security goals and attacker models under which the protocol aims to be secure.\r\n\r\nFollowing an invitation from the OpenID Foundation's FAPI Working Group (FAPI WG), we have accompanied the standardization process of the FAPI 2.0 protocol by an in-depth formal security analysis. In this paper, we report on our analysis and findings.\r\n\r\nOur analysis incorporates the first formal model of the FAPI 2.0 protocol and is based on a detailed model of the web infrastructure, the Web Infrastructure Model, originally proposed by Fett, K\u00fcsters, and Schmitz. Our analysis has uncovered several types of attacks on the protocol, violating the aforementioned security goals set by the FAPI WG. We subsequently have worked with the FAPI WG to fix the protocol, resulting in several changes to the specifications. After adapting our model to the changed specifications, we have proved the security properties to hold under the strong attacker model defined by the FAPI WG.",

    "abstract": "The security of lattice-based crytography (LWE, NTRU, and FHE) depends on the hardness of the shortest-vector problem (SVP). Sieving algorithms give the lowest asymptotic runtime to solve SVP, but depend on exponential memory. Memory access costs much more in reality than in the RAM model, so we consider a computational model where processors, memory, and meters of wire are in constant proportions to each other. While this adds substantial costs to route data during lattice sieving, we modify existing algorithms to amortize these costs and find that, asymptotically, a classical computer can achieve the previous RAM model cost of $2^{0.2925d+o(d)}$ to sieve a $d$-dimensional lattice for a computer existing in 3 or more spatial dimensions, and can reach $2^{0.3113d+o(d)}$ in 2 spatial dimensions, where \"spatial dimensions\" are the dimensions of the physical geometry in which the computer exists.\r\n\r\nUnder some assumptions about the constant terms of memory access, we estimate increases in bit security between $7$ to $23$ bits for different Kyber parameter sets and $8$ to $22$ bits for Dilithium.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) accomplishes collaborative model training without the need to share local training data. However, existing FL aggregation approaches suffer from inefficiency, privacy vulnerabilities, and neglect of poisoning attacks, severely impacting the overall performance and reliability of model training. In order to address these challenges, we propose SuperFL, an efficient two-server aggregation scheme that is both privacy preserving and secure against poisoning attacks. The two semi-honest servers $\\mathcal{S}_0$ and $\\mathcal{S}_1$ collaborate with each other, with a shuffle server $\\mathcal{S}_0$ in charge of privacy-preserving random clustering, while an analysis server $\\mathcal{S}_1$ responsible for robustness detection, identifying and filtering malicious model updates. Our scheme employs a novel combination of homomorphic encryption and proxy re-encryption to realize secure server-to-server collaboration. We also utilize a novel sparse matrix projection compression technique to enhance communication efficiency and significantly reduce communication overhead. To resist poisoning attacks, we introduce a dual-filter algorithm based on trusted root, combine dimensionality reduction and norm calculation to identify malicious model updates.\r\nExtensive experiments validate the efficiency and robustness of our scheme. SuperFL achieves impressive compression ratios, ranging from $5\\text{-}40$x, under different models while maintaining comparable model accuracy as the baseline. Notably, our solution demonstrates a maximal model accuracy decrease of no more than $2\\%$ and $6\\%$ on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets respectively, under specific compression ratios and the presence of malicious clients.",

    "abstract": "A major unresolved question in quantum cryptography is whether it is possible to obfuscate arbitrary quantum computation. Indeed, there is much yet to understand about the feasibility of quantum obfuscation even in the classical oracle model, where one is given for free the ability to obfuscate any classical circuit.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we develop a new array of techniques that we use to construct a quantum state obfuscator, a powerful notion formalized recently by Coladangelo and Gunn (arXiv:2311.07794) in their pursuit of better software copy-protection schemes. Quantum state obfuscation refers to the task of compiling a quantum program, consisting of a quantum circuit $C$ with a classical description and an auxiliary quantum state $\\ket{\\psi}$, into a functionally-equivalent obfuscated quantum program that hides as much as possible about $C$ and $\\ket{\\psi}$. We prove the security of our obfuscator when applied to any pseudo-deterministic quantum program, i.e. one that computes a (nearly) deterministic classical input / classical output functionality. Our security proof is with respect to an efficient classical oracle, which may be heuristically instantiated using quantum-secure indistinguishability obfuscation for classical circuits. \r\n\r\nOur result improves upon the recent work of Bartusek, Kitagawa, Nishimaki and Yamakawa (STOC 2023) who also showed how to obfuscate pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits in the classical oracle model, but only ones with a completely classical description. Furthermore, our result answers a question of Coladangelo and Gunn, who provide a construction of quantum state indistinguishability obfuscation with respect to a quantum oracle, but leave the existence of a concrete real-world candidate as an open problem. Indeed, our quantum state obfuscator together with Coladangelo-Gunn gives the first candidate realization of a ``best-possible'' copy-protection scheme for all polynomial-time functionalities.\r\n\r\nOur techniques deviate significantly from previous works on quantum obfuscation. We develop several novel technical tools which we expect to be broadly useful in quantum cryptography. These tools include a publicly-verifiable, linearly-homomorphic quantum authentication scheme with classically-decodable ZX measurements (which we build from coset states), and a method for compiling any quantum circuit into a \"linear + measurement\" ($\\LM$) quantum program: an alternating sequence of CNOT operations and partial ZX measurements.",

    "abstract": "We continue the study of $t$-wise independence of substitution-permutation networks (SPNs) initiated by the recent work of Liu, Tessaro, and Vaikuntanathan (CRYPTO 2021).\r\nOur key technical result shows that when the S-boxes are randomly and independently chosen and kept secret, an $r$-round SPN with input length $n = b \\cdot k$ is $2^{-\\Theta(n)}$-close to $t$-wise independent within $r = O(\\min\\{k, \\log t\\})$ rounds for any $t$ almost as large as $2^{b/2}$. Here, $b$ is the input length of the S-box and we assume that the underlying mixing achieves maximum branch number.\r\nWe also analyze the special case of AES parameters (with random S-boxes), and show it is $2^{-128}$-close to pairwise independent in $7$ rounds.\r\nCentral to our result is the analysis of a random walk on what we call the layout graph, a combinatorial abstraction that captures equality and inequality constraints among multiple SPN evaluations.\r\nWe use our technical result to show concrete security bounds for SPNs with actual block cipher parameters and small-input $S$-boxes.  (This is in contrast to the large body of results on ideal-model analyses of SPNs.) For example, for the censored-AES block cipher, namely AES with most of the mixing layers removed, we show that 192 rounds suffice to attain $2^{-128}$-closeness to pairwise independence. The prior such result for AES (Liu, Tessaro and Vaikuntanathan, CRYPTO 2021) required more than 9000 rounds.",

    "abstract": "A tweakable wide blockcipher is a construction which behaves in the same way as a tweakable blockcipher, with the difference that the actual block size is flexible. Due to this feature, a tweakable wide blockcipher can be directly used as a strong encryption scheme that provides full diffusion when encrypting plaintexts to ciphertexts and vice versa. Furthermore, it can be the basis of authenticated encryption schemes fulfilling the strongest security notions. In this paper, we present three instantiations of the docked double decker tweakable wide blockcipher: $\\mathit{ddd}\\text{-}\\mathit{AES}$, $\\mathit{ddd}\\text{-}\\mathit{AES}^+$, and $\\mathit{bbb}\\text{-}\\mathit{ddd}\\text{-}\\mathit{AES}$. These instances exclusively use similar building blocks as AES-GCM (AES and finite field multiplication), are designed for maximal parallelism, and hence, can make efficient use of existing hardware accelerators. $\\mathit{ddd}\\text{-}\\mathit{AES}$ is a birthday bound secure scheme, and $\\mathit{ddd}\\text{-}\\mathit{AES}^+$ is an immediate generalization to allow for variable length tweaks. $\\mathit{bbb}\\text{-}\\mathit{ddd}\\text{-}\\mathit{AES}$ achieves security beyond the birthday bound provided that the same tweak is not used too often. Moreover, $\\mathit{bbb}\\text{-}\\mathit{ddd}\\text{-}\\mathit{AES}$ builds upon a novel conditionally beyond birthday bound secure pseudorandom function, a tweakable variant of the XOR of permutations, facilitating in the need to include a tweak in the AES evaluations without sacrificing flexibility in docked double decker. We furthermore introduce an authenticated encryption mode $\\mathit{aaa}$ specifically tailored to be instantiated with $\\mathit{ddd}\\text{-}\\mathit{AES}$ and $\\mathit{bbb}\\text{-}\\mathit{ddd}\\text{-}\\mathit{AES}$, where special attention is given to how the nonce and associated data can be processed. We prove that this mode is secure in the nonce-respecting setting, in the nonce-misuse setting, as well as in the setting where random nonces are used.",

    "abstract": "The present article explains how to generalize the hash function SwiftEC (in an elementary quasi-unified way) to any elliptic curve $E$ over any finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{\\!q}$ of characteristic $> 3$. The new result apparently brings the theory of hash functions onto elliptic curves to its logical conclusion. To be more precise, this article provides compact formulas that define a hash function $\\{0,1\\}^* \\to E(\\mathbb{F}_{\\!q})$ (deterministic and indifferentible from a random oracle) with the same working principle as SwiftEC. In particular, both of them equally compute only one square root in $\\mathbb{F}_{\\!q}$ (in addition to two cheap Legendre symbols). However, the new hash function is valid with much more liberal conditions than SwiftEC, namely when $3 \\mid q-1$. Since in the opposite case $3 \\mid q-2$ there are already indifferentiable constant-time hash functions to $E$ with the cost of one root in $\\mathbb{F}_{\\!q}$, this case is not processed in the article. If desired, its approach nonetheless allows to easily do that mutatis mutandis.",

    "abstract": "Homomorphic encryption (HE) is in the spotlight as a solution for privacy-related issues in various real-world scenarios. However, the limited types of operations supported by each HE scheme have been a major drawback in applications. While HE schemes based on learning-with-error (LWE) problem provide efficient lookup table (LUT) evaluation in terms of latency, they have downsides in arithmetic operations and low throughput compared to HE schemes based on ring LWE (RLWE) problem. The use of HE on circuits containing LUT has been partly limited if they contain arithmetic operations or their computational width is large.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose homomorphic algorithms for batched queries on LUTs by using RLWE-based HE schemes. To look up encrypted LUTs of size $n$ on encrypted queries, our algorithms use $O(\\log{n})$ homomorphic comparisons and $O(n)$ multiplications. For unencrypted LUTs, our algorithms use $O(\\log{n})$ comparisons, $O(\\sqrt{n})$ ciphertext multiplications, and $O(n)$ scalar multiplications.\r\n\r\nWe provide a proof-of-concept implementation based on CKKS scheme (Asiacrypt 2017). The amortized running time for an encrypted (Resp. unencrypted) LUT of size $512$ is $0.041$ (Resp. $0.025$) seconds. Our implementation reported roughly $2.4$-$6.0$x higher throughput than the current implementation of LWE-based schemes, with more flexibility on the structure of the LUTs.",

    "abstract": "One category of the digital signatures submitted to the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process for Additional Digital Signature Schemes comprises proposals constructed leveraging the MPC-in-the-Head (MPCitH) paradigm. Typically, this framework is characterized by the computation and storage in sequence of large data structures both in signing and verification algorithms, resulting in heavy memory consumption. While some research on the efficiency of these schemes on high-performance machines has been done, studying their performance and optimization on resource-constrained ones still needs to be explored.\r\nIn this work, we aim to address this gap by (1) introducing a general method to reduce the memory footprint of MPCitH schemes and analyzing its application to several MPCitH proposed schemes in the NIST Standardization Process. Additionally, (2) we conduct a detailed examination of potential memory optimizations in PERK, resulting in a streamlined version of the signing and verification algorithms with a reduced memory footprint ranging from 22 to 85 KB, down from the original 0.3 to 6 MB. Finally, (3) we introduce the first implementation of PERK tailored for Arm Cortex M4 alongside extensive experiments and comparisons against reference implementations.",

    "abstract": "In the current paper we investigate the possibility of designing secure two-party signature scheme with the same verification algorithm as in the Russian standardized scheme (GOST scheme). We solve this problem in two parts. The first part is a (fruitless) search for an appropriate scheme in the literature. It turned out that all existing schemes are insecure in the strong security models. The second part is a synthesis of new signature scheme and ends fruitfully. We synthesize a new two-party GOST signature scheme, additionally using the commitment scheme, guided by the features of the GOST signature scheme, as well as the known attacks on existing schemes. We prove that this scheme is secure in a bijective random oracle model in the case when one of the parties is malicious under the assumption that the classical GOST scheme is unforgeable in a bijective random oracle model and the commitment scheme is modelled as a random oracle.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a data-minimization approach enabling collaborative model training across diverse clients with local data, avoiding direct data exchange. However, state-of-the-art FL solutions to identify fraudulent financial transactions exhibit a subset of the following limitations. They (1) lack a formal security definition and proof, (2) assume prior freezing of suspicious customers\u2019 accounts by financial institutions (limiting the solutions\u2019 adoption), (3) scale poorly, involving either $O(n^2)$ computationally expensive modular exponentiation (where $n$ is the total number of financial institutions) or highly inefficient fully homomorphic encryption, (4) assume the parties have already completed the identity alignment phase, hence excluding it from the implementation, performance evaluation, and security analysis, and (5) struggle to resist clients\u2019 dropouts. This work introduces Starlit, a novel scalable privacy-preserving FL mechanism that overcomes these limitations. It has various applications, such as enhancing financial fraud detection, mitigating terrorism, and enhancing digital health. We implemented Starlit and conducted a thorough performance analysis using synthetic data from a key player in global financial transactions. The evaluation indicates Starlit\u2019s scalability, efficiency, and accuracy.",

    "abstract": "We introduce $\\mathsf{ChalametPIR}$: a single-server Private Information Retrieval (PIR) scheme supporting fast, low-bandwidth \\emph{keyword} queries, with a conceptually very simple design. In particular, we develop a generic framework for converting PIR schemes for index queries over flat arrays (based on Learning With Errors) into keyword PIR. This involves representing a key-value map using any probabilistic filter that permits reconstruction of elements from inclusion queries (e.g. Cuckoo filters). In particular, we make use of recently developed \\emph{Binary Fuse filters} to construct $\\mathsf{ChalametPIR}$, with minimal efficiency blow-up compared with state-of-the-art index-based schemes (all costs bounded by a factor of $\\leq 1.08$). Furthermore, we show that $\\mathsf{ChalametPIR}$ achieves runtimes and financial costs that are factors of between $6\\times$-$11\\times$ and $3.75\\times$-$11.4\\times$ more efficient, respectively, than state-of-the-art keyword PIR approaches, for varying database configurations. Bandwidth costs are reduced or remain competitive, depending on the configuration. Finally, we believe that our application of Binary Fuse filters can have independent value towards developing efficient variants of related cryptographic primitives (e.g. private set intersection), that already benefit from using less efficient filter constructions.",

    "abstract": "In this work,  we propose two novel succinct one-out-of-many proofs from coding theory,  which can be seen as extensions of the Stern's framework and Veron's framework from proving knowledge of a preimage to proving knowledge of a preimage for one element in a set, respectively. The size of each proof is short and scales better with the size of the public set than the code-based accumulator in \\cite{nguyen2019new}. Based on our new constructions, we further present a logarithmic-size ring signature scheme and a logarithmic-size group signature scheme. Our schemes feature a short signature size, especially our group signature. To our best knowledge, it is the most compact code-based group signature scheme so far. At 128-bit security level, our group signature size is about 144 KB for a group with $2^{20}$ members while the group signature size of the previously most compact code-based group signature constructed by the above accumulator exceeds 3200 KB.",

    "abstract": "Dual-receiver encryption (DRE) is a special form of public key encryption (PKE) that allows a sender to encrypt a message for two recipients. Without further properties, the difference between DRE and PKE is only syntactical. One such important property is soundness, which requires that no ciphertext can be constructed such that the recipients decrypt to different plaintexts. Many applications rely on this property in order to realize more complex protocols or primitives. In addition, many of these applications explicitly avoid the usage of the random oracle, which poses an additional requirement on a DRE construction. We show that all of the IND-CCA2 secure standard model DRE constructions based on post-quantum assumptions fall short of augmenting the constructions with soundness and describe attacks thereon.\r\nWe then give an overview over all applications of IND-CCA2 secure DRE, group them into generic (i. e., applications using DRE as black-box) and non-generic applications and demonstrate that all generic ones require either soundness or public verifiability.\r\nConclusively, we identify the gap of sound and IND-CCA2 secure DRE constructions based on post-quantum assumptions in the standard  Model.\r\nIn order to fill this gap we provide two IND-CCA2 secure DRE constructions based on the standard post-quantum assumptions, Normal Form Learning With Errors (NLWE) and Learning Parity with Noise (LPN).",

    "abstract": "The remarkable performance capabilities of AI accelerators offer promising opportunities for accelerating cryptographic algorithms, particularly in the context of lattice-based cryptography. However, current approaches to leveraging AI accelerators often remain at a rudimentary level of implementation, overlooking the intricate internal mechanisms of these devices. Consequently, a significant number of computational resources is underutilized.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present a comprehensive exploration of NVIDIA Tensor Cores and introduce a novel framework tailored specifically for Kyber. Firstly, we propose two innovative approaches that efficiently break down Kyber's NTT into iterative matrix multiplications, resulting in approximately a 75% reduction in costs compared to the state-of-the-art scanning-based methods.Secondly, by reversing the internal mechanisms, we precisely manipulate the internal resources of Tensor Cores using assembly-level code instead of inefficient standard interfaces, eliminating memory accesses and redundant function calls. Finally, building upon our highly optimized NTT, we provide a complete implementation for all parameter sets of Kyber. Our implementation surpasses the state-of-the-art Tensor Core based work, achieving remarkable speed-ups of 1.93x, 1.65x, 1.22x and 3.55x for polyvec_ntt, KeyGen, Enc and Dec in Kyber-1024, respectively. Even when considering execution latency, our throughput-oriented full Kyber implementation maintains an acceptable execution latency. For instance, the execution latency ranges from 1.02 to 5.68 milliseconds for Kyber-1024 on R3080 when achieving the peak throughput.",

    "abstract": "SNOVA is a multivariate signature scheme submitted to the ad- ditional NIST PQC standardization project started in 2022. SNOVA is con- structed by incorporating the structure of the matrix ring over a finite field into the UOV signature scheme, and the core part of its public key is the UOV public key whose coefficients consist of matrices. As a result, SNOVA dramatically reduces the public key size compared to UOV. In this paper, we recall the construction of SNOVA, and reconsider its security analysis. In particular, we investigate key recovery attacks applied to the core part of the public key of SNOVA in detail. Due to our analysis, we show that some pa- rameters of SNOVA submitted in the additional NIST PQC standardization do not satisfy the claimed security levels.",

    "abstract": "Post-quantum digital signature schemes have recently received increased attention due to the NIST standardization project for additional signatures. MPC-in-the-Head and VOLE-in-the-Head are general techniques for constructing such signatures from zero-knowledge proof systems. A common theme between the two is an all-but-one vector commitment scheme which internally uses GGM trees. This primitive is responsible for a significant part of the computational time during signing and verification.\r\n\r\nA more efficient technique for constructing GGM trees is the half-tree technique, introduced by Guo et al. (Eurocrypt 2023). Our work builds an all-but-one vector commitment scheme from the half-tree technique, and further generalizes it to an all-but-\\(\\tau\\) vector commitment scheme. Crucially, our work avoids the use of the random oracle assumption in an important step, which means our binding proof is non-trivial and instead relies on the random permutation oracle. Since this oracle can be instantiated using fixed-key AES which has hardware support, we achieve faster signing and verification times.\r\n\r\nWe integrate our vector commitment scheme into FAEST (faest.info), a round one candidate in the NIST standardization process, and demonstrates its performance with a prototype implementation. For \\(\\lambda = 128\\), our experimental results show a nearly \\(3.5\\)-fold improvement in signing and verification times.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we examine Differential Fault Attacks (DFA) targeting two stream ciphers, FLIP and FiLIP. We explore the fault model where an adversary flips a single bit of the key at an unknown position. Our analysis involves establishing complexity bounds for these attacks, contingent upon the cryptographic parameters of the Boolean functions employed as filters and the key size.\r\nInitially, we demonstrate how the concept of sensitivity enables the detection of the fault position using only a few keystream bits. This represents an enhancement over previous DFA methodologies applied to these ciphers. Subsequently, we leverage the properties of the filter's derivatives to execute attacks. This approach is universally applicable to any filter, and we delineate specific attack strategies for the two function families previously implemented in these ciphers.",

    "abstract": "The use of zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) and similar types of proofs has become increasingly popular as a solution for improving scalability, privacy, and interoperability of blockchain systems. However, even with the most advanced proving systems, verifying a single SNARK proof can require a significant amount of computational resources making it expensive to be performed on-chain. This becomes a noticeable bottleneck in scaling SNARK-based applications.\r\n\r\nFurther efficiency improvement to avoid this bottleneck lies in utilizing distributed recursive proof composition to aggregate multiple existing proofs into one that verifies all underlying proofs. \r\n\r\nBuilding upon this concept, we present a new protocol for decentralized recursive proof aggregation allowing one unique proof to aggregate many input proofs to be efficiently verified on-chain, increasing the throughput and cost efficiency of SNARK-based blockchains. The protocol is designed for decentralized environments where independent actors (provers) can join and contribute to the proof generation process. We also present an incentive scheme for such actors. The protocol is abstract enough to be used with a variety of proving systems that support recursive aggregation.",

    "abstract": "Despite decades of effort, a chasm exists between the theory and practice of device-level biometric authentication. Deployed authentication algorithms rely on data that overtly leaks private information about the biometric; thus systems rely on externalized security measures such as trusted execution environments. The authentication algorithms have no cryptographic guarantees.\r\n  \r\nThis is  frustrating given the research that has developed theoretical tools, known as fuzzy extractors, that enable secure, privacy-preserving biometric authentication with public enrollment data (Dodis et al., SIAM JoC 2008). Unfortunately, fuzzy extractor systems either:\r\n-Make strong independence assumptions, such as:\r\n-- Bits of biometrics are i.i.d. (or that all correlation is pairwise between features (Hine et al., TIFS 2023)), or\r\n-- For an error-correcting code, the nearest codeword and the coset of biometric readings are independent (Zhang, Cui, and Yu, ePrint 2021/1559).\r\n  These assumptions either have not been statistically checked or \r\n  statistical analysis indicates they are false.\r\n- Or use incorrect cryptographic analysis.  Simhadri et al. (ISC, 2019) assume the security of sample-then-lock (Canetti et al., Journal of Cryptology 2021) is captured by the average min-entropy of subsets.  Zhang et al. (ICPR, 2022) show an attack on this incorrect analysis. \r\n\r\nThis work introduces IrisLock, an iris key derivation system powered by technical advances in both\r\n1) feature extraction from the iris  and\r\n2) the fuzzy extractor used to secure authentication keys.  The fuzzy extractor builds on sample-then-lock (Canetti et al., Journal of Cryptology 2021). We correct a proof in Canetti et al. and show the minimum of min-entropy of subsets is the relevant security measure.  Our primary parameters are $42$ bits of security at $45\\%$ true accept rate (TAR).  Our quantitive level of security is as good as the above systems, Simhadri et al's incorrect analysis yields an estimate of $32$ bits, while Zhang et al.'s system on the face estimates $45$ bits (with the independence condition). One can easily incorporate a password, boosting security to $64$ bits.\r\n\r\nIrises used to evaluate TAR and security are class disjoint from those used for training and collecting statistics (the open dataset regime).\r\nThe only statistical assumption made is necessary: the accuracy of min-entropy estimation.",

    "abstract": "In a seminal work, Ishai et al. (FOCS\u20132006) studied the viability of designing unconditionally secure protocols for key agreement and secure multi-party computation (MPC) using an anonymous bulletin board (ABB) as a building block. While their results establish the feasibility of key agreement and honest-majority MPC in the ABB model, the optimality of protocols with respect to their round and communication complexity is not studied. This paper enriches this study of unconditional security in the ABB model in multiple ways.\r\n\r\n- We present a key agreement protocol with a novel combinatorial insight to offer a 200% throughput over the (FOCS\u20132006) study; i.e., using the same number of messages, we can (almost) double the bit-length of the agreed key. We also prove the near optimality of our approach.\r\n\r\n- We offer unconditionally secure protocols for the (random) string oblivious transfer functionalities. We present a $1$-round chosen message random string oblivious transfer and show how to extend it to a non-interactive (random) string oblivious transfer protocol and a $2$-round chosen message string oblivious transfer.\r\n\r\n- We prove a $1$-round lower bound for BEC under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nCentral to our technical contributions is the abstraction of a distributional variant of the random ABB functionality. Investigating the concrete efficiency of founding MPC from this primitive leads to fascinating new mathematical challenges in well-established MPC models, which will be of broader interest to the community.",

    "abstract": "Laconic cryptography enables secure two-party computation (2PC) on unbalanced inputs with asymptotically-optimal communication in just two rounds of communication. In particular, the receiver (who sends the first-round message) holds a long input and the sender (who sends the second-round message) holds a short input, and the size of their communication to securely compute a function on their joint inputs only grows with the size of the sender's input and is independent of the receiver's input size. \r\nThe work on laconic oblivious transfer (OT) [Cho et al. CRYPTO 2017] and laconic private set intersection (PSI) [Alamati et al. TCC 2021] shows how to achieve secure laconic computation for OT and PSI from the Diffie-Hellman assumption.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we push the limits further and achieve laconic branching programs from the Diffie-Hellman assumption. In particular, the receiver holds a large branching program $P$ and the sender holds a short input $x$. We present a two-round 2PC protocol that allows the receiver to learn $x$ iff $P(x) =1$, and nothing else. The communication only grows with the size of $x$ and the depth of $P$, and does not further depend on the size of $P$.",

    "abstract": "Private Set Intersection (PSI) is a widely used protocol that enables two parties to securely compute a function over the intersected part of their shared datasets and has been a significant research focus over the years. However, recent studies have highlighted its vulnerability to Set Membership Inference Attacks (SMIA), where an adversary might deduce an individual's membership by invoking multiple PSI protocols. This presents a considerable risk, even in the most stringent versions of PSI, which only return the cardinality of the intersection. This paper explores the evaluation of anonymity within the PSI context.\r\nInitially, we highlight the reasons why existing works fall short in measuring privacy leakage, and subsequently propose two attack strategies that address these deficiencies. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of our proposed methods.\r\nIn addition to these, we illustrate how the integration of auxiliary information, such as  the sum of payloads associated with members of the intersection (PSI-SUM), can enhance attack efficiency.\r\nWe conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation of various attack strategies proposed utilizing two real datasets. Our findings indicate that the methods we propose markedly enhance attack efficiency when contrasted with previous research endeavors.  The effective attacking implies that depending solely on existing PSI protocols may not provide an adequate level of privacy assurance.  It is recommended to combine privacy-enhancing technologies synergistically to enhance privacy protection even further.",

Users periodically monitor the directory to ensure their own identifier maps to the correct keys, thus detecting any attempt to register a fake key on their behalf to Meddler-in-the-Middle (MitM) their communications.\r\nWe introduce and formalize a new primitive called Multi-Device Verifiable Key Directory (MVKD), which strengthens both the security, privacy, and usability guarantees of VKD by leveraging the multi-device setting.\r\nWe formalize three properties for a MVKD (completeness, extraction-based soundness, and privacy), striking a non-trivial balance between strong guarantees and the limitations imposed by a truly practical system.\r\nWe then present a new MVKD system called ELEKTRA. This system combines the core of the Keybase KT system (running in production since 2014) with ideas from SEEMless (Chase et. al., 2019) and RZKS (Chen et. al., 2022).\r\nOur construction is the first to achieve the above multi-device guarantees while having formal security and privacy proofs. Finally, we implement ELEKTRA and present benchmarks demonstrating its practicality.",

    "abstract": "Most multivariate proof systems require, at some point, an algebraic check against the rows of the trace. One popular protocol for this is known as zerocheck which is a sumcheck based protocol which proves a constraint function is zero over the $n$-dimensional Boolean hypercube. One of the drawbacks of running zerocheck over a small field, is that it usually involves a large number of evaluations of the constraint polynomial over a cryptographically large extension field $\\mathbb{G}$.\r\n\r\n  We describe several improvements to the zerocheck protocol over a small field $\\mathbb{F}$ which both reduce the number of constraint evaluations the prover needs to perform and shifts some computation from the extension field back into the base field $\\mathbb{F}$. Specifically, for a table of length $2^n$, integer parameter $1\\leq k \\leq n$ and constraint function $C$ of degree $d$ with evaluation costs $C_{\\mathbb{F}}, C_{\\mathbb{G}}$ we show the protocol can be performed with prover cost roughly\r\n  \\[\r\n    2^n\\left(1 + \\frac{C_{\\mathbb{G}}}{2^k C_{\\mathbb{F}}}\\right)(d - 1)C_{\\mathbb{F}}.\r\n  \\]\r\n  \r\n  To check the proof, the verifier needs to perform a single interpolation of degree $2^kd$ and $n$ interpolations of degree $d$. Thus varying $k$ allows for a tradeoff between prover and verifier cost.",

    "abstract": "Bootstrapping is currently the only known method for constructing fully homomorphic encryptions.\r\nIn the BFV scheme specifically, bootstrapping aims to reduce the error of a ciphertext while preserving the encrypted plaintext.\r\nThe existing BFV bootstrapping methods follow the same pipeline, relying on the evaluation of a digit extraction polynomial to annihilate the error located in the least significant digits.\r\nHowever, due to its strong dependence on performance, bootstrapping could only utilize a limited form of plaintext modulus, such as a power of a small prime number.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present a novel approach to instantiate BFV bootstrapping, distinct from the previous digit extraction-based method. \r\nThe core idea of our bootstrapping is to utilize CKKS bootstrapping as a subroutine, so the performance of our method mainly depends on the underlying CKKS bootstrapping rather than the plaintext modulus.\r\n\r\nWe implement our method at a proof-of-concept level to provide concrete benchmark results. \r\nWhen performing the bootstrapping operation for a 51-bits plaintext modulus, our method improves the previous digit extraction-based method by a factor of 37.9 in latency and 29.4 in throughput. \r\nAdditionally, we achieve viable bootstrapping performance for large plaintext moduli, such as 144-bits and 234-bits, which has never been measured before.",

However, the selected algorithms are still vulnerable to side-channel attacks in practice, and their physical security need to be further evaluated. \r\nThis study introduces two efficient power analysis attacks, the optimized fast two-stage approach and the single-bit approach, aimed at reducing the key guess space in NTT polynomial multiplication on an STM32F405 device (ARM Cortex-M4 core). \r\nOur findings reveal that the optimized approach outperforms the conservative approach and the fast two-stage approach proposed in ICCD 2021 by factors of 519 and 88, respectively. \r\nSimilarly, the single-bit approach demonstrates speedups of 365 and 62 times compared to these two approaches, respectively.",

    "abstract": "In July 2022, the US National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) announced the first set of Post-Quantum Cryptography standards: Kyber, Dilithium, Falcon, and SPHINCS+. Shortly after, NIST published a call for proposals for additional post-quantum signature schemes to complement their initial portfolio. In 2023, 50 submissions were received, and 40 were accepted as round-1 candidates for future standardization.\r\nIn this paper, we study the suitability and performance of said candidates on the popular Arm Cortex-M4microcontroller. We integrate the suitable implementations into the benchmarking framework pqm4 and provide benchmarking results on the STM32L4R5ZI featuring 640 KB of RAM. pqm4 currently includes reference implementations for 15 submissions and M4-optimized implementations for five submissions. For the remaining candidates, we describe the reasons that hinder integration - the predominant reason being large key size or excessive memory consumption.\r\nWhile the performance of reference implementations is rather meaningless and often does not correlate with the performance of well-optimized implementations, this work provides some first indication of which schemes are most promising on microcontrollers. The publicly available implementations in pqm4 also provide a good starting point for future optimization efforts.\r\nInitially, we were hoping for a much higher code quality than for initial submissions to NIST's previous PQC project. However, we got grossly disappointed: Half of the submissions make use of dynamic memory allocations, often completely without reason; Many implementations have compiler warnings, sometimes hinting at more serious issues; Many implementations do not pass simple sanitizer tests such as using valgrind; Multiple implementations make use of static memory.",

    "abstract": "PRESENT is an ultra-lightweight block cipher designed by Bogdanov et al., and has been widely studied since its proposal. It supports 80-bit and 128-bit keys, which are referred as PRESENT-80 and PRESENT-128, respectively. Up to now, linear cryptanalysis is the most effective method on attacking this cipher, especially when accelerated with the pruned Walsh transform. Combing pruned Walsh transform with multiple linear attacks, one can recover the right key for 28-round PRESENT-80 and -128. Later, this method is further improved with affine pruned Walsh transform by adding more zeros in the Walsh spectrum through rejecting some data. This leads to the 29-round attack on PRESENT-128 with full codebook.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we follow the affine pruned Walsh transform accelerated linear method, and propose 29-round attacks on both PRESENT-80 and PRESENT-128 without using full codebook. Both attacks rely on a statistical model depicting distributions of the experimental correlation when some data are artificially rejected in its computation. Besides, detailed analysis of complexity reduction for each linear hull used in attacking PRESENT is also provided and supported by an automatic tool. Our 29-round attack on PRESENT-80 mainly benefits from this tool. According to our knowledge, both attacks are the best ones on PRESENT so far.",

    "abstract": "The conversion between arithmetic and Boolean masking representations (A2B \\& B2A) is a crucial component for side-channel resistant implementations of lattice-based (post-quantum) cryptography. In this paper, we first propose novel $d$-order algorithms for the secure addition (SecADDChain$_q$) and B2A (B2X2A). Our secure adder is well-suited for repeated ('chained') executions, achieved through an improved method for repeated masked modular reduction. The optimized B2X2A gadget removes a full secure addition compared to state-of-the-art B2A approaches, by relying on the X2B operation. This component directly converts a compositely shared variable, consisting of a mix of arithmetic and Boolean sharing, to $d+1$ Boolean shares. This approach reduces the required amount of SecADDs to $2d$, of which $2\\cdot\\lceil\\text{log}_2(d)\\rceil$ are max-order. \r\n\r\nSecondly, we develop both a first- and high-order masked, unified hardware implementation that can compute both A2B & B2A conversions for power-of-two ($p$) and prime ($q$) moduli. Compared to state-of-the-art (high-throughput) hardware implementations that only support A2B$_k$, we reduce area utilization for a second-order implementation by 45% up to 60% and fresh randomness up to 62%, while supporting all four types of additive mask conversions. Our first-order design only requires 1,133/2,170 [LUT/FF] on Kintex-7 FPGAs.\r\n\r\nOur proposed algorithms are proven secure in the robust probing model and their implementations are validated via practical lab analysis using the TVLA methodology. We experimentally show that our masked implementation is hardened against first-and second order univariate and multivariate power-based side-channel attacks using 100 million traces, for each mode of operation.",

    "abstract": "The BGV scheme is one of the most popular FHE schemes for computing homomorphic integer arithmetic. The bootstrapping technique of BGV is necessary to evaluate arbitrarily deep circuits homomorphically. However, the BGV bootstrapping performs poorly for large plaintext prime $p$ due to its digit removal procedure exhibiting a computational complexity of at least $O(\\sqrt{p})$. In this paper, we propose optimizations for the digit removal procedure with large $p$ by leveraging the properties of null polynomials over the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_{p^e}$. Specifically, we demonstrate that it is possible to construct low-degree null polynomials based on two observations of the input to the digit removal procedure: 1) the support size of the input can be upper-bounded by $(2B+1)^2$; 2) the size of the lower digits to be removed can be upper-bounded by $B$. Here $B$ can be controlled within a narrow interval $[22,23]$ in our parameter selection, making the degree of these null polynomials much smaller than $p$ for large values of $p$. These low-degree null polynomials can significantly reduce the polynomial degrees during homomorphic digit removal, thereby decreasing both running time and capacity consumption. Theoretically, our optimizations reduce the computational cost of extracting a single digit from $O(\\sqrt{pe})$ (by Chen and Han) or $O(\\sqrt{p}\\sqrt[4]{e})$ (by Geelen et al.) to $\\min(2B+1,\\sqrt{\\lceil e/t\\rceil(2B+1)})$ for some $t\\ge 1$. We implement and benchmark our method on HElib with $p=17,127,257,8191$ and $65537$. With our optimized digit removal, we achieve a bootstrapping throughput $1.38\\sim151$ times that in HElib, with the speedup increasing with the value of $p$. For $p=65537$, we accelerate the digit removal step by 80 times and reduce the bootstrapping time from more than 12 hours to less than 14 minutes.",

    "abstract": "In their 2021 seminal paper, Li and Micciancio presented a passive attack against the CKKS approximate FHE scheme and introduced the notion of CPAD security. The current status quo is that this line of attacks does not apply to ``exact'' FHE. In this paper, we challenge this status quo by exhibiting a CPAD key recovery attack on the linearly homomorphic Regev cryptosystem which easily generalizes to other xHE schemes such as BFV, BGV and TFHE showing that these cryptosystems are not CPAD secure in their basic form. We also show that existing threshold variants of BFV, BGV and CKKS are particularily exposed to CPAD attackers and would be CPAD-insecure without smudging noise addition after partial decryption. Finally we successfully implement our attack against several mainstream FHE libraries and discuss a number of natural countermeasures as well as their consequences in terms of FHE practice, security and efficiency. The attack itself is quite practical as it typically takes less than an hour on an average laptop PC, requiring a few thousand ciphertexts as well as up to around a million evaluations/decryptions, to perform a full key recovery.",

    "abstract": "We analyse HWQCS, a code based signature scheme presented at ICISC 2023, which uses quasi-cyclic low density parity check codes (QC-LDPC). The scheme introduces high Hamming weight errors and signs each message using a fresh ephemeral secret key rather than using only one secret key, so to avoid known attacks on QC-LDPC signature schemes.\r\n    In this paper, we show that the signatures of HWQCS leak substantial information concerning the ephemeral keys and formally describe this behaviour. Furthermore, we show that for each security level, we can exploit the leakage to efficiently reconstruct partial secret data from very few signatures, and finally mount a universal forgery attack.",

    "abstract": "Homomorphic encryption is a powerful privacy-preserving technology that is notoriously difficult to configure and use, even for experts. The key difficulties include restrictive programming models of homomorphic schemes and choosing suitable parameters for an application. In this tutorial, we outline methodologies to solve these issues and allow for conversion of any application to the encrypted domain using both leveled and fully homomorphic encryption. \r\n\r\nThe first approach, called Walrus, is suitable for arithmetic-intensive applications with limited depth and applications with high throughput requirements. Walrus provides an intuitive programming interface and handles parameterization automatically by analyzing the application and gathering statistics such as homomorphic noise growth to derive a parameter set tuned specifically for the application. We provide an in-depth example of this approach in the form of a neural network inference as well as guidelines for using Walrus effectively. \r\n\r\nConversely, the second approach (HELM) takes existing HDL designs and converts them to the encrypted domain for secure outsourcing on powerful cloud servers. Unlike Walrus, HELM supports FHE backends and is well-suited for complex applications. At a high level, HELM consumes netlists and is capable of performing logic gate operations homomorphically on encryptions of individual bits. HELM incorporates both CPU and GPU acceleration by taking advantage of the inherent parallelism provided by Boolean circuits. As a case study, we walk through the process of taking an off-the-shelf HDL design in the form of AES-128 decryption and running it in the encrypted domain with HELM.",

    "abstract": "In recent breakthrough results, novel use of garbled circuits yielded constructions for several primitives like Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) and 2-round secure multi-party computation, based on standard assumptions in public-key cryptography. While the techniques in these different results have many common elements, these works did not offer a modular abstraction that could be used across them.\r\n\r\nOur main contribution is to introduce a novel notion of obfuscation, called Reach-Restricted Reactive Program Obfuscation (R3PO) that captures the essence of these constructions, and exposes additional capabilities. We provide a powerful composition theorem whose proof fully encapsulates the use of garbled circuits in these works.\r\nAs an illustration of the potential of R3PO, and as an important contribution of independent interest, we present a variant of Multi-Authority Attribute-Based Encryption (MA-ABE) that can be based on (single-authority) CP-ABE in a blackbox manner, using only standard cryptographic assumptions (e.g., DDH). This is in stark contrast to the existing constructions for MA-ABE, which rely on the random oracle model and/or support only limited policy classes.",

    "abstract": "The Signal protocol and its X3DH key exchange core are regularly used by billions of people in applications like WhatsApp but are unfortunately not quantum-secure. Thus, designing an efficient and post-quantum secure X3DH alternative is paramount. Notably, X3DH supports asynchronicity, as parties can immediately derive keys after uploading them to a central server, and deniability, allowing parties to plausibly deny having completed key exchange. To satisfy these constraints, existing post-quantum X3DH proposals use ring signatures (or equivalently a form of designated-verifier signatures) to provide authentication without compromising deniability as regular signatures would. Existing ring signature schemes, however, have some drawbacks. Notably, they are not generally proven secure in the quantum random oracle model (QROM) and so the quantum security of parameters that are proposed is unclear and likely weaker than claimed. In addition, they are generally slower than standard primitives like KEMs.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose an efficient, deniable and post-quantum X3DH-like protocol that we call K-Waay, that does not rely on ring signatures. At its core, K-Waay uses a split-KEM, a primitive introduced by Brendel et al. [SAC 2020], to provide Diffie-Hellman-like implicit authentication and secrecy guarantees. Along the way, we revisit the formalism of Brendel et al. and identify that additional security properties are required to prove a split-KEM-based protocol secure. We instantiate split-KEM by building a protocol based on the Frodo key exchange protocol relying on the plain LWE assumption: our proofs might be of independent interest as we show it satisfies our novel unforgeability and deniability security notions. Finally, we complement our theoretical results by thoroughly benchmarking both K-Waay and existing X3DH protocols. Our results show even when using plain LWE and a conservative choice of parameters that K-Waay is significantly faster than previous work.",

By dropping its deterministic attribute, it can be accelerated to an extent that it is practically useful, though still much slower than the widely used Miller-Rabin-Selfridge-Monier (MRSM) algorithm based on the Fermat Little Theorem or the Solovay-Strassen algorithm based on the Euler Criterion. The change made, in the last stage of AKS, is to check a modular equation not for a long sequence of values but for a single one. Another change is to reduce, arbitrarily, the size of the parameter $r$ giving the degree of the polynomial used for the last stage.",

    "abstract": "Payment channel networks are a promising solution to the scalability challenge of blockchains and are designed for significantly increased transaction throughput compared to the layer one blockchain. Since payment channel networks are essentially decentralized peer-to-peer networks, routing transactions is a fundamental challenge. Payment channel networks have some unique security and privacy requirements that make pathfinding challenging, for instance, network topology is not publicly known, and sender/receiver privacy should be preserved, in addition to providing atomicity guarantees for payments. In this paper, we present an efficient privacy-preserving routing protocol, SPRITE, for payment channel networks that supports concurrent transactions. By finding paths offline and processing transactions online, SPRITE can process transactions in just two rounds, which is more efficient compared to prior work. We evaluate SPRITE\u2019s performance using Lightning Net- work data and prove its security using the Universal Composability framework. In contrast to the current cutting-edge methods that achieve rapid transactions, our approach significantly reduces the message complexity of the system by 3 orders of magnitude while maintaining similar latencies.",

    "abstract": "We study the complexity of memory checkers with computational security and prove the first general tight lower bound.\r\n\r\nMemory checkers, first introduced over 30 years ago by Blum, Evans, Gemmel, Kannan, and Naor (FOCS '91, Algorithmica '94), allow a user to store and maintain a large memory on a remote and unreliable server by using small trusted local storage. The user can issue instructions to the server and after every instruction, obtain either the correct value or a failure (but not an incorrect answer) with high probability. The main complexity measure of interest is the size of the local storage and the number of queries the memory checker makes upon every logical instruction. The most efficient known construction has query complexity $O(\\log n/\\log\\log n)$ and local space proportional to a computational security parameter, assuming one-way functions, where $n$ is the logical memory size. Dwork, Naor, Rothblum, and Vaikuntanathan (TCC '09) showed that for a restricted class of ``deterministic and non-adaptive'' memory checkers, this construction is optimal, up to constant factors. However, going beyond the small class of deterministic and non-adaptive constructions has remained a major open problem.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we fully resolve the complexity of memory checkers by showing that any construction with local space $p$ and query complexity $q$ must satisfy \r\n    $$ p \\ge \\frac{n}{(\\log n)^{O(q)}} \\;. $$\r\nThis implies, as a special case, that $q\\ge \\Omega(\\log n/\\log\\log n)$ in any scheme, assuming that $p\\le n^{1-\\varepsilon}$ for $\\varepsilon>0$.  The bound applies to any scheme with computational security, completeness $2/3$, and inverse polynomial in $n$ soundness (all of which make our lower bound only stronger). We further extend the lower bound to schemes where the read complexity $q_r$ and write complexity $q_w$ differ. For instance, we show the tight bound that if $q_r=O(1)$ and $p\\le n^{1-\\varepsilon}$ for $\\varepsilon>0$, then $q_w\\ge n^{\\Omega(1)}$. This is the first lower bound, for any non-trivial class of constructions, showing a read-write query complexity trade-off.\r\n\r\nOur proof is via a delicate compression argument showing that a ``too good to be true'' memory checker can be used to compress random bits of information. We draw inspiration from tools recently developed for lower bounds for relaxed locally decodable codes. However, our proof itself significantly departs from these works, necessitated by the differences between settings.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies on deep-learning-based side-channel attacks (DL-SCAs) have shown that traditional performance evaluation metrics commonly used in DL, like accuracy and F1 score, are not effective in evaluating DL-SCA performance. Therefore, some previous studies have proposed new alternative metrics for evaluating the performance of DL-SCAs. Notably, perceived information (PI) and effective perceived information (EPI) are major metrics based on information theory. While it has been experimentally confirmed that these metrics can give the attack success rate (SR) for DL-SCAs, their theoretical validity remains unclear.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose a new theoretically valid performance evaluation metric called latent perceived information (LPI), which serves as an alternative to the existing metrics. LPI is defined as the mutual information between the output of the feature extractor of a neural network (NN) model and the intermediate value, representing the potential attack performance of the trained model. First, we prove that LPI provides an upper bound on the SR of a DL-SCA by modeling and formulating DL-SCA as a communication channel. Additionally, we clarify the conditions under which PI and EPI theoretically provide an upper bound on the SR from the perspective of LPI. For practical computation of LPI, we present two methods. One utilizes the Kraskov (KSG) estimator, a common mutual information estimator, and the other is based on logistic regression. While the KSG estimator is computationally intensive, it yields accurate LPI values. In contrast, the logistic regression is faster but provides a lower bound for LPI. Through experimental attacks on AES software and hardware implementations with masking countermeasures, we demonstrate that the LPI values estimated by these two methods are significantly similar, indicating the reliability and soundness of our proposed estimation techniques. Furthermore, we show that, by using the logistic regression as a classifier, we can significantly improve the attack performance of the trained model when the difference between the SR upper bound by the LPI and its actual SR is large. This indicates that LPI represents the potential for performance improvement in the trained model. Therefore, our study contributes to optimizing the distinguisher for attack performance using the trained model.",

    "abstract": "A linear code with few weights is a significant code family in coding theory. A linear code is considered self-orthogonal if contained within its dual code. Self-orthogonal codes have applications in linear complementary dual codes, quantum codes, etc. The construction of linear codes is an interesting research problem. There are various methods to construct linear codes, and one approach involves utilizing cryptographic functions defined over finite fields. The construction of linear codes (in particular, self-orthogonal codes) from functions has been studied in the literature. In this paper, we generalize the construction method given by\r\nHeng et al. in [Des. Codes Cryptogr. 91(12), 2023] to weakly regular plateaued functions. We first construct several families of p-ary linear codes with few weights from weakly regular plateaued unbalanced (resp. balanced) functions over the finite fields of odd characteristics. We observe that the constructed codes are self-orthogonal codes when p = 3. Then, we use the constructed ternary self-orthogonal codes to build new families of ternary LCD codes. Consequently, we obtain (almost) optimal ternary self-orthogonal codes and LCD codes.",

    "abstract": "A recent security model for fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), called IND-CPA^D security and introduced by Li and Micciancio [Eurocrypt'21], strengthens IND-CPA security by giving the attacker access to a decryption oracle for ciphertexts for which it should know the underlying plaintexts. This includes ciphertexts that it (honestly) encrypted and those obtained from the latter by evaluating circuits that it chose. Li and Micciancio singled out the CKKS FHE scheme for approximate data [Asiacrypt'17] by giving an IND-CPA^D attack on it and claiming that IND-CPA security and IND-CPA^D security coincide for exact FHE schemes. \r\n\r\nWe correct the widespread belief according to which IND-CPA^D attacks are specific to approximate homomorphic computations. Indeed, the equivalency formally proved by Li and Micciancio assumes that the schemes have a negligible probability of incorrect decryption. However, almost all competitive implementations of exact FHE schemes give away strong correctness by analyzing correctness heuristically and allowing noticeable probabilities of incorrect decryption. \r\n\r\nWe exploit this imperfect correctness to mount efficient non-adaptive indistinguishability and key-recovery attacks against all major exact FHE schemes. We illustrate their strength by implementing them for BFV using OpenFHE and simulating an attack for the default parameter set of the CGGI implementation of TFHE-rs (the attack experiment is too expensive to be run on commodity desktops, because of the cost of CGGI bootstrapping). Our attacks extend to CKKS for discrete data, and threshold versions of the exact FHE schemes, when the correctness is similarly loose.",

    "abstract": "The prevailing ciphers rely on the weak assumption that their attacker is not smarter than expected by their designers.  The resultant crypto ecology favors the cryptographic powerhouses, and hinders cyber freedom, cyber privacy and cyber democracy.  This weakness can be remedied by using the gold standard of cryptography -- One Time Pad, OTP.  Alas, it comes with a prohibitive cost of a key as long as the message it encrypts. When the stakes are high enough users pay this high price because  OTP is immunized against smarter and better equipped attackers. Claude Shannon has shown that this size imposition on the key is non-negotiable in the context he analyzed. Alas, changing the context, one could achieve OTP equivalence. Three simple changes are introduced: (i) make the size of the key an integral part of the secret, (ii) every finite message is encrypted with an arbitrary part of the key, (iii) allow for open-ended dilution of the contents-bearing bits of the ciphertext, with content-devoid bits, which don't confuse the intended recipient, but impose an open-ended cryptanalytic barrier before the attacker. A-priori a cryptanalyst is facing a set of messages each of them deemed plausible to be the one hidden in the ciphertext. If the ciphertext is Finite Key OTP compliant then membership in this set will not change after an exhaustive cryptanalytic processing of the ciphertext. This constitutes functional equivalence with OTP.  OTP functionality with a shared finite key creates a path to digital freedom, digital privacy and digital democracy.",

    "abstract": "While formal constructions for cryptographic schemes have steadily evolved and emerged over the past decades, the design and implementation of efficient and secure hardware instances is still a mostly manual, tedious, and intuition-driven process. With the increasing complexity of modern cryptography, e.g., Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) schemes, and consideration of physical implementation attacks, e.g., Side-Channel Analysis (SCA), the design space often grows exorbitantly without developers being able to weigh all design options.\r\n\r\nThis immediately raises the necessity for tool-assisted Design Space Exploration (DSE) for efficient and secure cryptographic hardware. For this, we present the progressive HADES framework, offering a customizable, extendable, and streamlined DSE for efficient and secure cryptographic hardware accelerators. This tool exhaustively traverses the design space driven by security requirements, rapidly predicts user-defined performance metrics, e.g., area footprint or cycle-accurate latency, and instantiates the most suitable candidate in a synthesizable Hardware Description Language (HDL).\r\n\r\nWe demonstrate the capabilities of our framework by applying our proof-of-concept implementation to a wide-range selection of state-of-the-art symmetric and PQC schemes, including the ChaCha20 stream cipher and the designated PQC standard Kyber, for which we provide the first set of arbitrary-order masked hardware implementations.",

    "abstract": "The transition to post-quantum cryptography has been an enormous challenge and effort for cryptographers over the last decade, with impressive results such as the future NIST standards. However, the latter has so far only considered central cryptographic mechanisms (signatures or KEM) and not more advanced ones, e.g., targeting privacy-preserving applications. Of particular interest is the family of solutions called blind signatures, group signatures and anonymous credentials, for which standards already exist, and which are deployed in billions of devices. Such a family does not have, at this stage, an efficient post-quantum counterpart although very recent works  improved this state of affairs by offering two different alternatives: either one gets a system with rather large elements but a security proved under standard assumptions or one gets a more efficient system at the cost of ad-hoc interactive assumptions or weaker security models. Moreover, all these works have only considered size complexity without implementing the quite complex building blocks their systems are composed of. In other words, the practicality of such systems is still very hard to assess, which is a problem if one envisions a post-quantum transition for the corresponding systems/standards.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose a construction of so-called signature with efficient protocols (SEP), which is the core of such privacy-preserving solutions. By revisiting the approach by Jeudy et al. (Crypto 2023) we manage to get the best of the two alternatives mentioned above, namely short sizes with no compromise on security. To demonstrate this, we plug our SEP in an anonymous credential system, achieving credentials of less than 80 KB. In parallel, we fully implemented our system, and in particular the complex zero-knowledge framework of Lyubashevsky et al. (Crypto'22), which has, to our knowledge, not be done so far. Our work thus not only improves the state-of-the-art on privacy-preserving solutions, but also significantly improves the understanding of efficiency and implications for deployment in real-world systems.",

    "abstract": "Although having been popular for a long time, Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus under the partially-synchronous network is denounced to be inefficient or even infeasible in recent years, which calls for a more robust asynchronous consensus. On the other hand, almost all the existing asynchronous consensus are too complicated to understand and even suffer from the termination problem. Motivated by the above problems, we propose SimpleFT in this paper, which is a simple asynchronous consensus and is mainly inspired by the simplicity of the Bitcoin protocol. With a re-understanding of the Bitcoin protocol, we disassemble the life cycle of a block into three phases, namely proposal, dissemination, and confirmation. Corresponding to these phases, we devise or introduce the sortition algorithm, reliable broadcast algorithm, and quorum certificate mechanism in SimpleFT, respectively. To make full use of the network resources and improve the system throughput, we further introduce the layered architecture to SimpleFT, which enables multiple blocks to be confirmed at the same height. Comprehensive analysis is made to validate the correctness of SimpleFT and various experiments are conducted to demonstrate its efficient performance.",

    "abstract": "Symmetric cryptography primitives are constructed by iterative applications of linear and nonlinear layers. Constructing efficient circuits for these layers, even for the linear one, is challenging. In 1997, Paar proposed a heuristic to minimize the number of XORs (modulo 2 addition) necessary to implement linear layers. In this study, we slightly modify Paar\u2019s heuristics to find implementations for nonlinear Boolean functions, in particular to homogeneous Boolean functions. Additionally, we show how this heuristic can be used to construct circuits for generic Boolean functions with small number of AND gates, by exploiting affine equivalence relations.",

    "abstract": "The conventional Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) paradigm requires replicated state machines to execute deterministic operations only. In practice, numerous applications and scenarios, especially in the era of blockchains, contain various sources of non-determinism. Despite decades of research on BFT, we still lack an efficient and easy-to-deploy solution for BFT with non-determinism\u2014BFT-ND, especially in the asynchronous setting.\r\nWe revisit the problem of BFT-ND and provide a formal and asynchronous treatment of BFT-ND. In particular, we design and implement Block-ND that insightfully separates the task of agreeing on the order of transactions from the task of agreement on the state: Block-ND allows reusing existing BFT implementations; on top of BFT, we reduce the agreement on the state to multivalued Byzantine agreement (MBA), a somewhat neglected primitive by practical systems. Block-ND is completely asynchronous as long as the underlying BFT is asynchronous.\r\nWe provide a new MBA construction significantly faster than existing MBA constructions. We instantiate Block-ND in both the partially synchronous setting (with PBFT, OSDI 1999) and the purely asynchronous setting (with PACE, CCS 2022). Via a 91-instance WAN deployment on Amazon EC2, we show that Block-ND has only marginal performance degradation compared to conventional BFT.",

    "abstract": "The implementation security of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms has emerged as a critical concern with the PQC standardization process reaching its end. In a side-channel-assisted chosen-ciphertext attack, the attacker builds linear inequalities on secret key components and uses the belief propagation (BP) algorithm to solve. The number of inequalities leverages the query complexity of the attack, so the fewer the better. In this paper, we use the PQC standard algorithm Kyber512 as a study case to construct bilateral inequalities on key variables with substantially narrower intervals using a side-channel-assisted oracle. The number of such inequalities required to recover the key with probability 1 utilizing the BP algorithm is reduced relative to previous unilateral inequalities. Furthermore, we introduce strategies aimed at further refining the interval of inequalities. Diving into the BP algorithm, we discover a measure metric named JSD-metric that can gauge the tightness of an inequality. We then develop a heuristic strategy and a machine learning-based strategy to utilize the JSD-metrics to contract boundaries of inequalities even with fewer inequalities given, thus improving the information carried by the system of linear inequalities. This contraction strategy is at the algorithmic level and has the potential to be employed in all attacks endeavoring to establish a system of inequalities concerning key variables.",

    "abstract": "Secure transformer inference has emerged as a prominent research topic following the proliferation of ChatGPT. Existing solutions are typically interactive, involving substantial communication load and numerous interaction rounds between the client and the server. \r\nIn this paper, we propose NEXUS, the first non-interactive protocol for secure transformer inference. The protocol requires the client to engage in just one round of communication with the server during the whole inference process: submitting an encrypted input and receiving an encrypted result. NEXUS introduces several novel primitives, including SIMD ciphertext compression/decompression, SIMD slot folding, and secure Argmax, which enable it to significantly surpass the state-of-the-art in communication while maintaining comparable runtime. Specifically, it reduces bandwidth consumption by 372.5$\\times$ compared to BOLT (Oakland~'24) and 53.6$\\times$ compared to Bumblebee (NDSS~'25). Furthermore, its non-interactive property allows for optimal hardware acceleration, with the GPU version achieving a 42.3$\\times$ speedup in runtime. This enables NEXUS to run inference on a BERT-based model in just 37.3 seconds, consuming only 164~MB of bandwidth.",

    "abstract": "We study sleepy consensus in the known participation model, where replicas are aware of the minimum number of awake honest replicas. Compared to prior works that almost all assume the unknown participation model, we provide a fine-grained treatment of sleepy consensus in the known participation model and show some interesting results. First, we present a synchronous atomic broadcast protocol with $5\\Delta+2\\delta$ expected latency and $2\\Delta+2\\delta$ best-case latency, where $\\Delta$ is the bound on network delay and $\\delta$ is the actual network delay. In contrast, the best-known result in the unknown participation model (MMR, CCS 2023) achieves $14\\Delta$ latency, more than twice the latency of our protocol. Second, in the partially synchronous network  (the value of $\\Delta$ is unknown), we show that without changing the conventional $n \\geq 3f+1$ assumption, one can only obtain a secure sleepy consensus by making the stable storage assumption (where replicas need to store intermediate consensus parameters in stable storage).  Finally, still in the partially synchronous network but not assuming stable storage, we prove the bounds on $n \\geq 3f+2s+1$ without the global awake time (GAT) assumption (all honest replicas become awake after GAT) and $n \\geq 3f+s+1$ with the GAT assumption, where $s$ is the maximum number of honest replicas that may become asleep simultaneously. Using these bounds, we transform HotStuff (PODC 2019) into a sleepy consensus protocol via a timeoutQC mechanism and a low-cost recovery protocol.",

    "abstract": "After NIST\u2019s selection of Dilithium as the primary future standard for quantum-secure digital signatures, increased efforts to understand its implementation security properties are required to enable widespread adoption on embedded devices. Concretely, there are still many open questions regarding the susceptibility of Dilithium to fault attacks. This is especially the case for Dilithium\u2019s randomized (or hedged) signing mode, which, likely due to devastating implementation attacks on the deterministic mode, was selected as the default by NIST.\r\nThis work takes steps towards closing this gap by presenting two new key-recovery fault attacks on randomized/hedged Dilithium. Both attacks are based on the idea of correcting faulty signatures after signing. A successful correction yields the value of a secret intermediate that carries information on the key. After gathering many faulty signatures and corresponding correction values, it is possible to solve for the signing key via either simple linear algebra or lattice-reduction techniques. Our first attack extends a previously published attack based on an instruction-skipping fault to the randomized setting. Our second attack injects faults in the matrix A, which is part of the public key. As such, it is not sensitive to side-channel leakage and has, potentially for this reason, not seen prior analysis regarding faults.\r\nWe show that for Dilithium2, the attacks allow key recovery with as little as 1024 and 512 faulty signatures, respectively, with each signature generated by injecting a single targeted fault. We also demonstrate how our attacks can be adapted to circumvent several popular fault countermeasures with a moderate increase in the computational runtime and the number of required faulty signatures. These results are verified using both simulated faults and clock glitches on an ARM-based microcontroller.\r\nThe presented attacks demonstrate that also randomized Dilithium can be subject to diverse fault attacks, that certain countermeasures might be easily bypassed, and that potential fault targets reach beyond side-channel sensitive operations. Still, many further operations are likely also susceptible, implying the need for increased analysis efforts in the future.",

    "abstract": "Garbled Circuit (GC) techniques usually work with Boolean circuits. Despite intense interest, efficient arithmetic generalizations of GC were only known from heavy assumptions, such as LWE.\r\n\r\nWe construct arithmetic garbled circuits from circular correlation robust hashes, the assumption underlying the celebrated Free XOR garbling technique. Let $\\lambda$ denote a computational security parameter, and consider the integers $\\mathbb{Z}_m$ for any $m \\geq 2$. Let $\\ell = \\lceil \\log_2 m \\rceil$ be the bit length of $\\mathbb{Z}_m$ values. We garble arithmetic circuits over $\\mathbb{Z}_m$ where the garbling of each gate has size $O(\\ell \\cdot \\lambda)$ bits. Constrast this with Boolean-circuit-based arithmetic, requiring $O(\\ell^2\\cdot \\lambda)$ bits via the schoolbook multiplication algorithm, or $O(\\ell^{1.585}\\cdot \\lambda)$ bits via Karatsuba's algorithm.\r\n\r\nOur arithmetic gates are compatible with Boolean operations and with Garbled RAM, allowing to garble complex programs of arithmetic values.",

    "abstract": "Adaptor signature is a novel cryptographic primitive which ties together the signature and the leakage of a secret value. It has become an important tool for solving the scalability and interoperability problems in the blockchain. Aumayr et al. (Asiacrypt 2021) recently provide the formalization of the adaptor signature and present a provably secure ECDSA-based adaptor signature, which requires zero-knowledge proof in the pre-signing phase to ensure the signer works correctly. However, the number of zero-knowledge proofs is linear with the number of participants.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose efficient ECDSA-based adaptor signature schemes and give security proofs based on ECDSA. In our schemes, the zero-knowledge proofs in the pre-signing phase can be generated in a batch and offline. Meanwhile, the online pre-signing algorithm is similar to the ECDSA signing algorithm and can enjoy the same efficiency as ECDSA. In particular, considering specific verification scenarios, such as (batched) atomic swaps, our schemes can reduce the number of zero-knowledge proofs in the pre-signing phase to one, independent of the number of participants. Last, we conduct an experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the performance of our ECDSA-based adaptor signature reduces online pre-signing time by about 60% compared with the state-of-the-art ECDSA-based adaptor signature.",

    "abstract": "We implement a secure platform for statistical analysis over multiple organizations and multiple datasets. We provide a suite of protocols for different variants of JOIN and GROUP-BY operations. JOIN allows combining data from multiple datasets based on a common column. GROUP-BY allows aggregating rows that have the same values in a column or a set of columns, and then apply some aggregation summary on the rows (such as sum, count, median, etc.). Both operations are fundamental tools for relational databases. One example use case of our platform is in data marketing in which an analyst would join purchase histories and membership information, and then obtain statistics, such as \"Which products were bought by people earning this much per annum?\"\r\n\r\nBoth JOIN and GROUP-BY involve many variants, and we design protocols for several common procedures. In particular, we propose a novel group-by-median protocol that has not been known so far.  Our protocols rely on sorting protocols, and work in the honest majority setting and against malicious adversaries.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of JOIN and GROUP-BY protocols secure against a malicious adversary.",

    "abstract": "To enable parallel processing, the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure is introduced to the design of asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols, known as DAG-based BFT. Existing DAG-based BFT protocols operate in successive waves, with each wave containing three or four Reliable Broadcast (RBC) rounds to broadcast data, resulting in high latency due to the three communication steps required in each RBC. For instance, Tusk, a state-of-the-art DAG-based BFT protocol, has a good-case latency of 7 communication steps and an expected worst latency of 21 communication steps.\r\n\r\nTo reduce latency, we propose GradedDAG, a new DAG-based BFT consensus protocol based on our adapted RBC called Graded RBC (GRBC) and the Consistent Broadcast (CBC), with each wave consisting of only one GRBC round and one CBC round. Through GRBC, a replica can deliver data with a grade of 1 or 2, and a non-faulty replica delivering the data with grade 2 can ensure that more than 2/3 of replicas have delivered the same data. Meanwhile, through CBC, data delivered by different non-faulty replicas must be identical. In each wave, a block in the GRBC round will be elected as the leader. If a leader block has been delivered with grade 2, it and all its ancestor blocks can be committed. GradedDAG offers a good-case latency of 4 communication steps and an expected worst latency of 7.5 communication steps, significantly lower than the state-of-theart. Experimental results demonstrate GradedDAG\u2019s feasibility and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The notion of collaborative zk-SNARK is introduced by Ozdemir and Boneh (USENIX 2022), which allows multiple parties to jointly create a zk-SNARK proof over distributed secrets (also known as the witness).\r\nThis approach ensures the privacy of the witness, as no corrupted servers involved in the proof generation can learn anything about the honest servers' witness. \r\nLater, Garg et al. continued the study, focusing on how to achieve faster proof generation (USENIX 2023).\r\nHowever, their approach requires a powerful server that is responsible for the most resource-intensive computations and communications during the proof generation.\r\nThis requirement results in a scalability bottleneck, making their protocols unable to handle large-scale circuits.  \r\n\r\nIn this work, we address this issue by lifting a zk-SNARK called Libra (Crypto 2019) to a collaborative zk-SNARK and achieve a fully distributed proof generation, where all servers take roughly the same portion of the total workload.\r\nFurther, our protocol can be adapted to be secure against a malicious adversary by incorporating some verification mechanisms. \r\nWith 128 consumer machines and a 4Gbps network, we successfully generate a proof for a data-parallel circuit containing $2^{23}$ gates in merely 2.5 seconds and take only 0.5 GB memory for each server. This represents a $19\\times$ speed-up, compared to a local Libra prover.\r\nOur benchmark further indicates an impressive 877$\\times$ improvement in running time and a 992$\\times$ enhancement in communication compared to the implementation in previous work. Furthermore, our protocol is capable of handling larger circuits, making it scalable in practice.",

    "abstract": "A Proof of Exponentiation (PoE) allows a prover to efficiently convince a verifier that $y=x^e$ in some group of unknown order. PoEs are the basis for practical constructions of Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs), which, in turn, are important for various higher-level protocols in distributed computing. In applications such as distributed consensus, many PoEs are generated regularly, motivating protocols for secure aggregation of batches of statements into a few statements to improve the efficiency for both parties. Rotem (TCC 2021) recently presented two such generic batch PoEs.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we introduce two batch PoEs that outperform both proposals of Rotem and we evaluate their practicality. First, we show that the two batch PoEs of Rotem can be combined to improve the overall efficiency by at least a factor of two. Second, we revisit the work of Bellare, Garay, and Rabin (EUROCRYPT 1998) on batch verification of digital signatures and show that, under the low order assumption, their bucket test can be securely adapted to the setting of groups of unknown order. The resulting batch PoE quickly outperforms the state of the art in the expected number of group multiplications with the growing number of instances, and it decreases the cost of batching by an order of magnitude already for hundreds of thousands of instances. Importantly, it is the first batch PoE that significantly decreases both the proof size and complexity of verification. Our experimental evaluations show that even a non-optimized implementation achieves such improvements, which would match the demands of real-life systems requiring large-scale PoE processing.\r\n\r\nFinally, even though our proof techniques are conceptually similar to Rotem, we give an improved analysis of the application of the low order assumption towards secure batching of PoE instances, resulting in a tight reduction, which is important when setting the security parameter in practice.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces several algorithms related to the computation of orientations in endomorphism rings of supersingular elliptic curves. This problem boils down to representing integers by ternary quadratic forms, and it is at the heart of several results regarding the security of oriented-curves in isogeny-based cryptography. \r\nOur main contribution is to show that there exists efficient algorithms that can solve this problem for quadratic orders of discriminant $n$ up to $O(p^{4/3})$. Our approach improves upon previous results by increasing this bound from $O(p)$ to $O(p^{4/3})$ and removing some heuristics.\r\nWe introduce several variants of our new algorithm and provide a careful analysis of their asymptotic running time (without heuristic when it is possible). The best proven asymptotic complexity of one of our variant is $O(n^{3/4}/p)$ in average. The best heuristic variant has a complexity of $O(p^{1/3})$ for big enough $n$.\r\nWe then introduce several results regarding the computation of ideals between oriented orders. The first application of this is a simplification of the known reduction from vectorization to computing the endomorphism ring, removing the assumption on the factorization of the discriminant. As a second application, we relate the problem of computing fixed-degree isogenies between supersingular curves to the problem of computing orientations in endomorphism rings, and we show that for a large range of degree $d$, our new algorithms improve on the state-of-the-art, and in important special cases, the range of degree $d$ for which there exist a polynomial-time algorithm is increased. In the most special case we consider, when both curves are oriented by a small degree endomorphism, we show heuristically that our techniques allow the computation of isogenies of any degree, assuming they exist.",

    "abstract": "Fault injection attacks are a serious concern for cryptographic hardware. Adversaries may extract sensitive information from the faulty output that is produced by a cryptographic circuit after actively disturbing its computation. Alternatively, the information whether an output would have been faulty, even if it is withheld from being released, may be exploited. The former class of attacks, which requires the collection of faulty outputs, such as Differential Fault Analysis (DFA), then either exploits some knowledge about the position of the injected fault or about its value. The latter class of attacks, which can be applied without ever obtaining faulty outputs, such as Statistical Ineffective Fault Attacks (SIFA), then either exploits a dependency between the effectiveness of the fault injection and the value to be faulted (e.g., an LSB stuck-at-0 only affecting odd numbers), denoted as SIFA-1, or a conditional propagation of a faulted value based on a sensitive intermediate (e.g., multiplication of a faulted value by 0 prevents propagation), denoted as SIFA-2. The aptitude of additive masking schemes, which were designed to prevent side-channel analysis, to also thwart fault attacks is typically assumed to be limited. Common fault models, such as toggle/bit-flip, stuck-at-0 or stuck-at-1 survive the recombination of Boolean shares well enough for generic attacks to succeed. More precisely, injecting a fault into one or multiple Boolean shares often results in the same, or at least a predictable, error appearing in the sensitive variable after recombination. In this work, we show that additive masking in prime-order fields breaks such relationships, causing frequently exploited biases to decrease exponentially in the number of shares. As a result, prime masking offers surprisingly strong protection against generic statistical attacks, which require a dependency between the effectiveness of an injected fault and the secret variable that is manipulated, such as SIFA-1. Operation-dependent statistical attacks, such as SIFA-2 and Fault Template Attacks (FTA), may still be performed against certain prime-field structures, even if they are masked with many shares. Yet, we analyze the corresponding cases and are able to provide specific guidelines on how to avoid vulnerabilities either at the cipher design or implementation level by making informed decisions about the primes, non-linear mappings and masked gadgets used. Since prime-field masking appears to be one of the rare instances of affordable countermeasures that naturally provide sound protection against sidechannel analysis and certain fault injection attacks, we believe there is a strong incentive for developing new ciphers to leverage these advantages.",

    "abstract": "Biscuit is a recent multivariate signature scheme based on the MPC-in-the-Head paradigm. It has been submitted to the NIST competition for additional signature schemes. Signatures are derived from a zero-knowledge proof of knowledge of the solution of a structured polynomial system. This extra structure enables efficient proofs and compact signatures. This short note demonstrates that it also makes these polynomial systems easier to solve than random ones. As a consequence, the original parameters of Biscuit failed to meet the required security levels and had to be upgraded.",

    "abstract": "Speculative out-of-order execution is a strategy of masking execution latency by allowing younger instructions to execute before older instructions. While originally considered to be innocuous, speculative out-of-order execution was brought into the spotlight with the 2018 publication of the Spectre and Meltdown attacks. These attacks demonstrated that microarchitectural side channels can leak sensitive data accessed by speculatively executed instructions that are not part of the normal program execution. Since then, a significant effort has been vested in investigating how microarchitectural side channels can leak data from speculatively executed instructions and how to control this leakage. However, much less is known about how speculative out-of-order execution affects microarchitectural side-channel attacks.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we investigate how speculative out-of-order execution affects the Evict+Time cache attack. Evict+Time is based on the observation that cache misses are slower than cache hits, hence by measuring the execution time of code, an attacker can determine if a cache miss occurred during the execution. We demonstrate that, due to limited resources for tracking out-of-order execution, under certain conditions an attacker can gain more fine-grained information and determine whether a cache miss occurred in part of the executed code.\r\n\r\nBased on the observation, we design the Evict+Spec+Time attack, a variant of Evict+Time that can learn not only whether a cache miss occurred, but also in which part of the victim code it occurred. We demonstrate that Evict+Spec+Time is an order of magnitude more efficient than Evict+Time when attacking a T-table-based implementation of AES. We further show an Evict+Spec+Time attack on an S-box-based implementation of AES, recovering the key with as little as 14389 decryptions.  To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first successful Evict+Time attack on such a victim.",

Prior work [Wenger et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023a;b] proposed new machine learning (ML)-based attacks on LWE problems with small, sparse secrets, but these attacks require millions of LWE samples to train on and take days to recover secrets. We propose three key methods\u2014better pre-processing, angular embeddings and model pre-training\u2014to improve these attacks, speeding up preprocessing by 25\u00d7 and improving model sample efficiency by 10\u00d7. We demonstrate for the first time that pre-training improves and reduces\r\nthe cost of ML attacks on LWE. Our architecture improvements enable scaling to larger-dimension LWE problems: this work is the first instance of ML attacks recovering sparse binary secrets in dimension n = 1024, the smallest dimension used in practice for homomorphic encryption applications of LWE where sparse binary secrets are proposed.",

    "abstract": "In some linear key recovery attacks, the function which determines the value of the linear approximation from the plaintext, ciphertext and key is replaced by a similar map in order to improve the time or memory complexity at the cost of a data complexity increase. We propose a general framework for key recovery map substitution, and introduce Walsh spectrum puncturing, which consists of removing carefully-chosen coefficients from the Walsh spectrum of this map. The capabilities of this technique are illustrated by describing improved attacks on reduced-round Serpent (including the first 12-round attack on the 192-bit key variant), GIFT-128 and NOEKEON, as well as the full DES.",

We introduce a new definition of equivalence which captures the concept that two GFNs are identical up to re-labelling of the inputs/outputs, and give a procedure to test this equivalence relation. Such two GFNs are therefore cryptographically equivalent for several classes of attacks. It induces a reduction of the space of possible GFNs: the set of the $(k!)^2$ possible even-odd GFNs with $2k$ branches can be partitioned into $k!$ different classes.\r\n\r\nThis result can be very useful when looking for an optimal GFN regarding specific computationally intensive properties, such as the minimal number of active S-boxes in a differential trail. We also show that in several previous papers, many GFN candidates are redundant as they belong to only a few classes. Because of this reduction of candidates, we are also able to suggest better permutations than the one of WARP: they reach 64 active S-boxes in one round less and still have the same diffusion round that WARP. Finally, we also point out a new family of permutations with good diffusion properties.",

    "abstract": "Numerous applications in homomorphic encryption require an operation that moves the slots of a ciphertext to the coefficients of a different ciphertext. For the BGV and BFV schemes, the only efficient algorithms to implement this slot-to-coefficient transformation were proposed in the setting of non-power-of-two cyclotomic rings. In this paper, we devise an FFT-like method to decompose the slot-to-coefficient transformation (and its inverse) for power-of-two cyclotomic rings. The proposed method can handle both fully and sparsely packed slots. Our algorithm brings down the computational complexity of the slot-to-coefficient transformation from a linear to a logarithmic number of FHE operations, which is shown via a detailed complexity analysis.\r\n\r\nThe new procedures are implemented in Microsoft SEAL for BFV. The experiments report a speedup of up to $44\\times$ when packing $2^{12}$ elements from $\\operatorname{GF}(8191^8)$. We also study a fully packed bootstrapping operation that refreshes $2^{15}$ elements from $\\operatorname{GF}(65537)$ and obtain an amortized speedup of $12\\times$.",

    "abstract": "The problem of Broadcast Encryption (BE) consists in broadcasting an encrypted message to a large number of users or receiving devices in such a way that the emitter of the message can control which of the users can or cannot decrypt it.\r\n\r\n    Since the early 1990's, the design of BE schemes has received significant interest and many different concepts were proposed. A major breakthrough was achieved by Naor, Naor and Lotspiech (CRYPTO 2001) by partitioning cleverly the set of authorized users and associating a symmetric key to each subset. Since then, while there have been many advances in public-key based BE schemes, mostly based on bilinear maps, little was made on symmetric cryptography.\r\n\r\n    In this paper, we design a new symmetric-based BE scheme, named $\\Sigma\\Pi$BE, that relies on logic optimization and consensual security assumptions. It is competitive with the work of Naor et al. and provides a different tradeoff: the bandwidth requirement is significantly lowered at the cost of an increase in the key storage.",

    "abstract": "At the core of fully homomorphic encryption lies a procedure to refresh the ciphertexts whose noise component has grown too big. The efficiency of the so-called bootstrap is of paramount importance as it is usually regarded as the main bottleneck towards a real-life deployment of fully homomorphic crypto-systems. In two of the fastest implementations so far, the space of messages is limited to binary\r\nintegers. If the message space is extended to the discretized torus $T_{p_i}$ or equivalently to $Z_{p_i}$ with values of $p_i$ large as compared to the dimension of the polynomial ring in which the operations are realised, the bootstrap delivers incorrect results with far too high probability. As a consequence, the use of a residue numeral system to address large integers modulo $p = p_1 \u00d7 \\cdots \u00d7 p_\\kappa$ would be of limited interest in practical situations without the following remedy : rather than increasing the polynomial degree and thus the computational cost, we introduce here a novel and simple technique (hereafter referred to as \u201ccollapsing\u201d) which, by grouping the components of the mask, attenuates both rounding errors and computational costs, and greatly helps to sharpen the correctness of the bootstrap. We then rigorously estimate the probability of success as well as the output error, determine practical parameters to reach a given correctness threshold and present implementation results.",

    "abstract": "Threshold symmetric encryption (TSE), introduced by Agrawal et al. [DiSE, CCS 2018], provides scalable and decentralized solution for symmetric encryption by ensuring that the secret-key stays distributed at all times. They avoid having a single point of attack or failure, while achieving the necessary security requirements. TSE was further improved by Christodorescu et al. [ATSE, CCS 2021] to support an amortization feature which enables a \u201cmore privileged\u201d client to encrypt records in bulk by interacting only once with the key servers, while decryption must be performed individually for each record, potentially by a \u201cless privileged\u201d client. However, typical enterprises collect or generate data once and query it several times over its lifecycle in various data processing pipelines; i.e., enterprise workloads are often decryption heavy! ATSE does not meet the bar for this setting because of linear interaction / computation (in the number of records to be decrypted) \u2013 our experiments show that ATSE provides a sub-par throughput of a few hundred records / sec.\r\n\r\nWe observe that a large class of queries read a subsequence of records (e.g. a time window) from the database. With this access structure in mind, we build a new TSE scheme which allows for both encryption and decryption with flexible granularity, in that a client\u2019s interactions with the key servers is at most logarithmic in the number of records. Our idea is to employ a binary-tree access structure over the data, where only one interaction is needed to decrypt all ciphertexts within a sub-tree, and thus only log-many for any arbitrary size sub-sequence. Our scheme incorporates ideas from binary-tree encryption by Canetti et al. [Eurocrypt 2003] and its variants, and carefully merges that with Merkle-tree commitments to fit into the TSE setting. We formalize this notion as hierarchical threshold symmetric-key encryption (HiSE), and argue that our construction satisfies all essential TSE properties, such as correctness, privacy and authenticity with respect to our definition. Our analysis relies on a well-known XDH assumption and a new assumption, that we call $\\ell$-masked BDDH, over asymmetric bilinear pairing in the programmable random oracle model. We also show that our new assumption does hold in generic group model.\r\n\r\nWe provide an open-source implementation of HiSE. For practical parameters, we see 65$\\times$ improvement in latency and throughput over ATSE. HiSE can decrypt over 6K records / sec on server-grade hardware, but the logarithmic overhead in HiSE\u2019s encryption (not decryption) only lets us encrypt up to 3K records / sec (about 3-4.5$\\times$ slowdown) and incurs roughly 500 bytes of ciphertext expansion per record \u2013 while reducing this penalty is an important future work, we believe HiSE can offer an acceptable tradeoff in practice.",

    "abstract": "Secure merge considers the problem of combining two sorted lists into a single sorted secret-shared list. Merge is a fundamental building block for many real-world applications. For example, secure merge can implement a large number of SQL-like database joins, which are essential for almost any data processing task such as privacy-preserving fraud detection, ad conversion rates, data deduplication, and many more.\r\n\r\nWe present two constructions with communication bandwidth and rounds tradeoff. Logstar, our bandwidth-optimized construction, takes inspiration from Falk and Ostrovsky (ITC, 2021) and runs in  $O(n\\log^*n)$ time and communication with $O(\\log n)$ rounds. In particular, for all conceivable $n$, the $\\log^*n$ factor will be equal to the constant $2$, and therefore we achieve a near-linear running time. Median, our rounds-optimized construction, builds on the classic parallel medians-based insecure merge approach of Valiant (SIAM J. Comput., 1975), later explored in the secure setting by Blunk et al. (2022), and requires $O(n \\log^c n)$, $c \\approx 1.71$, communication with $O(\\log \\log n)$ rounds. \r\n\r\nWe introduce two additional constructions that merge input lists of different sizes. SquareRootMerge merges lists of sizes $n^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ and $n$ and runs in $O(n)$ time and communication with $O(\\log n)$ rounds. CubeRootMerge is closely inspired by Blunk et al.'s (2022) construction and merges lists of sizes $n^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $n$. It runs in $O(n)$ time and communication with $O(1)$ rounds.\r\n\r\nWe optimize our constructions for concrete efficiency. Today, concretely efficient secure merge protocols rely on standard techniques such as Batcher's merging network or generic sorting. These approaches require an $O(n \\log n)$ size circuit of $O(\\log n)$ depth. Despite significant research thrust, no work has been able to reduce their concrete costs. Our constructions are the first to be more efficient by improving their asymptotics and maintaining small constants. We analytically benchmark against these constructions and show that Logstar reduces bandwidth costs $\\approx2.0\\times$ and Median reduces rounds $\\approx1.5\\times$.",

    "abstract": "To improve the throughput of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocols, the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) topology has been introduced to parallel data processing, leading to the development of DAG-based BFT consensus. However, existing DAG-based works heavily rely on Reliable Broadcast (RBC) protocols for block broadcasting, which introduces significant latency due to the three communication steps involved in each RBC. For instance, DAGRider, a representative DAG-based protocol, exhibits a best latency of 12 steps, considerably higher than non-DAG protocols like PBFT, which only requires 3 steps. To tackle this issue, we propose LightDAG, which replaces RBC with lightweight broadcasting protocols such as Consistent Broadcast (CBC) and  Plain Broadcast (PBC). Since CBC and PBC can be implemented in two and one communication steps, respectively, LightDAG achieves low latency.\r\n  \r\n In our proposal, we present two variants of LightDAG, namely LightDAG1 and LightDAG2, each providing a trade-off between the best latency and the expected worst latency. In LightDAG1, every block is broadcast using CBC, which exhibits a best latency of 5 steps and an expected worst latency of 14 steps. Since CBC cannot guarantee the totality property, we design a block retrieval mechanism in LightDAG1 to assist replicas in retrieving missing blocks. LightDAG2 utilizes a combination of PBC and CBC for block broadcasting, resulting in a best latency of 4 steps and an expected worst latency of $12(t+1)$ steps, where $t$ represents the number of actual Byzantine replicas. Since a Byzantine replica may equivocate through PBC, LightDAG2 prohibits blocks from directly referencing contradictory blocks. To ensure liveness, we propose a mechanism to identify and exclude Byzantine replicas if they engage in equivocation attacks. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate LightDAG, and the results demonstrate its feasibility and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "A zero-knowledge proof of training (zkPoT) enables a party to prove that they have correctly trained a committed model based on a committed dataset without revealing any additional information about the model or the dataset. An ideal zkPoT should offer provable security and privacy guarantees, succinct proof size and verifier runtime, and practical prover efficiency. In this work, we present \\name, a zkPoT targeted for deep neural networks (DNNs) that achieves all these goals at once. Our construction enables a prover to iteratively train their model via (mini-batch) gradient descent, where the number of iterations need not be fixed in advance; at the end of each iteration, the prover generates a commitment to the trained model parameters attached with a succinct zkPoT, attesting to the correctness of the executed iterations. The proof size and verifier time are independent of the number of iterations.\r\n\r\nOur construction relies on two building blocks. First, we propose an optimized GKR-style (sumcheck-based) proof system for the gradient-descent algorithm with concretely efficient prover cost; this allows the prover to generate a proof for each iteration. We then show how to recursively compose these proofs across multiple iterations to attain succinctness. As of independent interest, we propose a generic framework for efficient recursive composition of GKR-style proofs, along with aggregatable polynomial commitments.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks indicate that \\name\\ can handle the training of complex models such as VGG-11 with 10~million parameters and batch size~$16$. The prover runtime is $15$~minutes per iteration, which is $\\mathbf{24 \\times}$ faster than generic recursive proofs, with prover memory overhead $\\mathbf{27\\times}$ lower. The proof size is $1.63$~megabytes, and the verifier runtime is only $130$~milliseconds, where both are independent of the number of iterations and the size of the dataset.",

Motivated by Roy (CRYPTO 2022), we first enhance the multi-user tweakable correlation robust notion of Guo et al. (CRYPTO 2020) with a {\\it key leaking oracle} that tells the adversary whether a certain user key satisfies the adversarially-chosen predicate. We then investigate the state-of-the-art hash construction of Guo et al. with respect to our new security definition, providing security proof as well as matching attacks.

    "abstract": "Power-of-two cyclotomics is a popular choice when instantiating the BGV scheme because of its efficiency and compliance with the FHE standard. However, in power-of-two cyclotomics, the linear transformations in BGV bootstrapping cannot be decomposed into sub-transformations for acceleration with existing techniques. Thus, they can be highly time-consuming when the number of slots is large, degrading the advantage brought by the SIMD property of the plaintext space. By exploiting the algebraic structure of power-of-two cyclotomics, this paper derives explicit decomposition of the linear transformations in BGV bootstrapping into NTT-like sub-transformations, which are highly efficient to compute homomorphically. Moreover, multiple optimizations are made to evaluate homomorphic linear transformations, including modified BSGS algorithms, trade-offs between level and time, and specific simplifications for thin and general bootstrapping. We implement our method on HElib. With the number of slots ranging from 4096 to 32768, we obtain a 2.4x$\\sim$55.1x improvement in bootstrapping throughput, compared to previous works or the naive approach.",

A SNARG satisfies adaptive soundness if the malicious prover can choose the statement to prove after seeing the scheme parameters. In this work, we provide the first adaptively-sound SNARG for $\\mathsf{NP}$ in the plain model assuming sub-exponentially-hard indistinguishability obfuscation, sub-exponentially-hard one-way functions, and either the (polynomial) hardness of the discrete log assumption or the (polynomial) hardness of factoring. This gives the first adaptively-sound SNARG for $\\mathsf{NP}$ from falsifiable assumptions. All previous SNARGs for $\\mathsf{NP}$ in the plain model either relied on non-falsifiable cryptographic assumptions or satisfied a weak notion of non-adaptive soundness (where the adversary has to choose the statement it proves before seeing the scheme parameters).",

    "abstract": "VOX is a UOV-like signature scheme submitted to Round 1 additional signatures of NIST PQC standardization process. In 2023 Furue and Ikematsu proposed a rectangular MinRank attack on VOX, resulting in the submitters changing their parameters to counter this attack. In this paper we propose a new type of MinRank attack called padded MinRank attack. We show that the attack is highly efficient in its running time, taking less than one minute to break eight of nine parameters and about eight hours for the remaining one. Therefore the parameters of VOX should be reexamined to ensure its safety.",

    "abstract": "In side-channel analysis (SCA), the success of an attack is largely dependent on the dataset sizes and the number of instances in each class. The generation of synthetic traces can help to improve attacks like profiling attacks. \r\nHowever, manually creating synthetic traces from actual traces is arduous. Therefore, automating this process of creating artificial traces is much needed. \r\nRecently, diffusion models have gained much recognition after beating another generative model known as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in creating realistic images. We explore the usage of diffusion models in the domain of SCA. We proposed frameworks for a known mask setting and unknown mask setting in which the diffusion models could be applied. Under a known mask setting, we show that the traces generated under the proposed framework preserved the original leakage. Next, we demonstrated that the artificially created profiling data in the unknown mask setting can reduce the required attack traces for a profiling attack. This suggests that the artificially created profiling data from the trained diffusion model contains useful leakages to be exploited.",

    "abstract": "Several distributed protocols, including distributed key generation (DKG) and interactive consistency (IC), depend on $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ instances of Byzantine Broadcast or Byzantine Agreement among $n$ nodes, resulting in ${\\Theta}(n^3)$ communication overhead.\r\n  \r\n In this paper, we provide a new methodology of realizing such broadcasts we call DRAGON: Decentralization at the cost of Representation after Arbitrary GrOupiNg. At the core of it, we arbitrarily group nodes into small ``shards'' and paired with multiple new primitives we call consortium-sender (dealer) broadcast (and secret sharing). The new tools enable a shard of nodes to jointly broadcast (or securely contribute a secret) to the whole population only at the cost of one dealer ({\\em as if} there is a representative). \r\n \r\n  With our new Dragon method, we construct the first two DKG protocols, both achieving optimal resilience, with sub-cubic total communication and computation. The first DKG generates a secret key within an Elliptic Curve group, incurring $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^{2.5}\\lambda)$ total communication and computation. The second DKG, while slightly increasing communication and computation by a factor of the statistical security parameter, generates a secret key as a field element, which makes it directly compatible with various off-the-shelf DLog-based threshold cryptographic systems. We also construct a first deterministic IC with sub-cubic communication. Along the way, we also formalize simulation-based security and proved it for publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS), making it possible for a modular analysis, which might be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Kyber KEM, the NIST selected PQC standard for Public Key Encryption and Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) has been subjected to a variety of side-channel attacks, through the course of the NIST PQC standardization process. However, all these attacks targeting the decapsulation procedure of Kyber KEM either require knowledge of the ciphertexts or require to control the value of ciphertexts for key recovery. However, there are no known attacks in a blind setting, where the attacker does not have access to the ciphertexts. While blind side-channel attacks are known for symmetric key cryptographic schemes, we are not aware of such attacks for Kyber KEM. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing the first blind side-channel attack on Kyber KEM. We target leakage of the pointwise multiplication operation in the decryption procedure to carry out practical blind side-channel attacks resulting in full key recovery. We perform practical validation of our attack using power side-channel from the reference implementation of Kyber KEM taken from the pqm4 library, implemented on the ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller. Our experiments clearly indicate the feasibility of our proposed attack in recovering the full key in only a few hundred to few thousand traces, in the presence of a suitably accurate Hamming Weight (HW) classifier.",

    "abstract": "Side-Channel Analysis (SCA) is critical in evaluating the security of cryptographic implementations. The search for hyperparameters poses a significant challenge, especially when resources are limited. In this work, we explore the efficacy of a multifidelity optimization technique known as BOHB in SCA. In addition, we proposed a new objective function called $ge_{+ntge}$, which could be incorporated into any Bayesian Optimization used in SCA. We show the capabilities of both BOHB and $ge_{+ntge}$ on four different public datasets. Specifically, BOHB could obtain the least number of traces in CTF2018 when trained in the Hamming weight and identity leakage model. Notably, this marks the first reported successful recovery of the key for the identity leakage model in CTF2018.",

    "abstract": "The computation of step functions over encrypted data is an essential issue in homomorphic encryption due to its fundamental application in privacy-preserving computing. However, an effective method for homomorphically computing general step functions remains elusive in cryptography. This paper proposes two polynomial approximation methods for general step functions to tackle this problem.  The first method leverages the fact that any step function can be expressed as a linear combination of shifted sign functions.  This connection enables the homomorphic evaluation of any step function using known polynomial approximations of the sign function. The second method boosts computational efficiency by employing a composite polynomial approximation strategy. We present a systematic approach to construct a composite polynomial $f_k \\circ f_{k-1} \\circ \\cdots \\circ f_1$ that increasingly approximates the step function as $k$ increases.  This method utilizes an adaptive linear programming approach that we developed to optimize the approximation effect of $f_i$ while maintaining the degree and coefficients bounded. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these two methods by applying them to typical step functions such as the round function and encrypted data bucketing, implemented in the HEAAN homomorphic encryption library.  Experimental results validate that our methods can effectively address the homomorphic computation of step functions.",

    "abstract": "BGV and BFV are among the most widely used fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes, supporting evaluations over a finite field. To evaluate a circuit with arbitrary depth, bootstrapping is needed. However, despite the recent progress,  bootstrapping of BGV/BFV still remains relatively impractical, compared to other FHE schemes.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we inspect the BGV/BFV bootstrapping procedure from a different angle. We provide a generalized bootstrapping definition that relaxes the correctness requirement of regular bootstrapping, allowing constructions that support only certain kinds of circuits with arbitrary depth. In addition, our definition captures a form of functional bootstrapping. In other words, the output encrypts a function evaluation of the input instead of the input itself.\r\n    \r\nUnder this new definition, we provide a bootstrapping procedure supporting different types of functions. Our construction is 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art BGV/BFV bootstrapping algorithms, depending on the evaluated function.\r\n    \r\nOf independent interest, we show that our technique can be used to improve the batched FHEW/TFHE bootstrapping construction introduced by Liu and Wang (Asiacrypt 2023). Our optimization provides a speed-up of 6x in latency and 3x in throughput for batched binary gate bootstrapping and a plaintext-space-dependent speed-up for batched functional bootstrapping with plaintext space smaller than $\\mathbb{Z}_{512}$.",

    "abstract": "We prove that the seminal KZG polynomial commitment scheme (PCS) is black-box extractable under a simple falsifiable assumption ARSDH. To create an interactive argument, we construct a compiler that combines a black-box extractable non-interactive PCS and a polynomial IOP (PIOP). The compiler incurs a minor cost per every committed polynomial. Applying the Fiat-Shamir transformation, we obtain slightly less efficient variants of well-known PIOP-based zk-SNARKs, such as Plonk, that are knowledge-sound in the ROM under the ARSDH assumption. Importantly, there is no need for idealized group models or knowledge assumptions. This results in the first known zk-SNARKs in the ROM from falsifiable assumptions with both an efficient prover and constant-size argument.",

    "abstract": "In response to the evolving landscape of quantum computing and the heightened vulnerabilities in classical cryptographic systems, our paper introduces a comprehensive cryptographic framework. Building upon the pioneering work of Kuang et al., we present a unification of two innovative primitives: the Quantum Permutation Pad (QPP) for symmetric key encryption and the Homomorphic Polynomial Public Key (HPPK) for Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) and Digital Signatures (DS). By harnessing matrix representations of the Galois Permutation Group and inheriting its bijective and non-commutative properties, QPP achieves quantum-secure symmetric key encryption, seamlessly extending Shannon\u2019s perfect secrecy to both classical and quantum-native systems. Simultaneously, HPPK, free of NP-hard problems, relies on the security of symmetric encryption for the plain public key. This is accomplished by concealing the mathematical structure through arithmetic representations or modular multiplicative operators (arithmetic QPP) of the Galois Permutation Group over hidden rings, utilizing their partial homomorphic properties. This ensures secure computation on encrypted data during secret encapsulations, thereby enhancing the security of the plain public key. The integration of KEM and DS within HPPK cryptography results in compact key, cipher, and signature sizes, showcasing exceptional performance. This paper organically unifies QPP and HPPK under the Galois Permutation Group, marking a significant advance in laying the groundwork for quantum-resistant cryptographic protocols. Our contribution propels the development of secure communication systems in the era of quantum computing.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few decades, we have seen a proliferation of advanced cryptographic primitives with lossy or homomorphic properties built from various assumptions such as Quadratic Residuosity, Decisional Diffie-Hellman, and Learning with Errors. These primitives imply hard problems in the complexity class $\\mathcal{SZK}$ (statistical zero-knowledge); as a consequence, they can only be based on assumptions that are broken in $\\mathcal{BPP}^{\\mathcal{SZK}}$. This poses a barrier for building advanced primitives from code-based assumptions, as the only known such assumption is Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) with an extremely low noise rate $\\frac{\\log^2 n}{n}$, which is broken in quasi-polynomial time.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose a new code-based assumption: Dense-Sparse LPN, that falls in the complexity class $\\mathcal{BPP}^{\\mathcal{SZK}}$ and is conjectured to be secure against subexponential time adversaries. Our assumption is a variant of LPN that is inspired by McEliece's cryptosystem and random $k\\mbox{-}$XOR in average-case complexity. Roughly, the assumption states that\r\n\\[(\\mathbf{T}\\, \\mathbf{M}, \\mathbf{s} \\,\\mathbf{T}\\, \\mathbf{M} + \\mathbf{e}) \\quad \\text{is indistinguishable from}\\quad  (\\mathbf{T} \\,\\mathbf{M}, \\mathbf{u}),\\] for a random (dense) matrix $\\mathbf{T}$, random sparse matrix $\\mathbf{M}$, and sparse noise vector $\\mathbf{e}$ drawn from the Bernoulli distribution with inverse polynomial noise probability.\r\n\r\nWe leverage our assumption to build lossy trapdoor functions (Peikert-Waters STOC 08). This gives the first post-quantum alternative to the lattice-based construction in the original paper. Lossy trapdoor functions, being a fundamental cryptographic tool, are known to enable a broad spectrum of both lossy and non-lossy cryptographic primitives; our construction thus implies these primitives in a generic manner. In particular, we achieve collision-resistant hash functions with plausible subexponential security, improving over a prior construction from LPN with noise rate $\\frac{\\log^2 n}{n}$ that is only quasi-polynomially secure.",

    "abstract": "It has been shown that post-quantum key exchange and authentication with ML-KEM and ML-DSA, NIST\u2019s postquantum algorithm picks, will have an impact on TLS 1.3 performance used in the Web or other applications. Studies so far have focused on the overhead of quantum-resistant algorithms on TLS time-to-first-byte (handshake time). Although these works have been important in quantifying the slowdown in connection establishment, they do not capture the full picture regarding real-world TLS 1.3 connections which carry sizable amounts of data. Intuitively, the introduction of an extra 10KB of ML-KEM and ML-DSA exchanges in the connection negotiation will inflate the connection establishment time proportionally more than it will increase the total connection time of a Web connection carrying 200KB of data. In this work, we quantify the impact of ML-KEM and ML-DSA on typical TLS 1.3 connections which transfer a few hundreds of KB from the server to the client. We study the slowdown in the time-to-last-byte of postquantum connections under normal network conditions and in more unstable environments with high packet delay variability and loss probabilities. We show that the impact of ML-KEM and ML-DSA on the TLS 1.3 time-to-last-byte under stable network conditions is lower than the impact on the handshake and diminishes as the transferred data increases. The time-to-last-byte increase stays below 5% for high-bandwidth, stable networks. It goes from 32% increase of the handshake time to under 15% increase of the time-to-last-byte when transferring 50KiB of data or more under low-bandwidth, stable network conditions. Even when congestion control affects connection establishment, the additional slowdown drops below 10% as the connection data increases to 200KiB. We also show that connections under lossy or volatile network conditions could see higher impact from post-quantum handshakes, but these connections\u2019 time-to-lastbyte increase still drops as the transferred data increases. Finally, we show that such connections are already significantly slow and volatile regardless of the TLS handshake.",

    "abstract": "Pseudorandom Correlation Functions (PCFs) allow two parties, given correlated evaluation keys, to locally generate arbitrarily many pseudorandom correlated strings, e.g. Oblivious Transfer (OT) correlations, which can then be used by the two parties to jointly run secure computation protocols. \r\nIn this work, we provide a novel and simple approach for constructing PCFs for OT correlation, by relying on constrained pseudorandom functions for a class of constraints containing a weak pseudorandom function (wPRF). We then show that tweaking the Naor-Reingold pseudorandom function and relying on low-complexity pseudorandom functions allow us to instantiate our paradigm. We further extend our ideas to obtain efficient public-key PCFs, which allow the distribution of correlated keys between parties to be non-interactive: each party can generate a pair of public/secret keys, and any pair of parties can locally derive their correlated evaluation key by combining their secret key with the other party's public key.\r\nIn addition to these theoretical contributions, we detail various optimizations and provide concrete instantiations of our paradigm relying on the Boneh-Ishai-Passel\u00e8gue-Sahai-Wu wPRF and the Goldreich-Applebaum-Raykov wPRF. Putting everything together, we obtain public-key PCFs with a throughput of 15k-40k OT/s, which is of a similar order of magnitude to the state-of-the-art interactive PCFs and about 4 orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art public-key PCFs. \r\nAs a side result, we also show that public-key PCFs can serve as a building block to construct reusable designated-verifier non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (DV-NIZK) for NP. Combined with our instantiations, this yields simple and efficient reusable DV-NIZKs for NP in pairing-free groups.",

    "abstract": "Traitor-tracing systems allow identifying the users who contributed to building a rogue decoder in a broadcast environment. In a traditional traitor-tracing system, a key authority is responsible for generating the global public parameters and issuing secret keys to users. All security is lost if the \\emph{key authority itself} is corrupt. This raises the question: Can we construct a traitor-tracing scheme, without a trusted authority?\r\n\r\n   In this work, we propose a new model for traitor-tracing systems where, instead of having a key authority, users could generate and register their own public keys. The public parameters are computed by aggregating all user public keys. Crucially, the aggregation process is \\emph{public}, thus eliminating the need of any trusted authority. We present two new traitor-tracing systems in this model based on bilinear pairings. Our first scheme is proven adaptively secure in the generic group model. This scheme features a transparent setup, ciphertexts consisting of $6\\sqrt{L}+4$ group elements, and a public tracing algorithm. Our second scheme supports a bounded collusion of traitors and is proven selectively secure in the standard model. Our main technical ingredients are new registered functional encryption (RFE) schemes for quadratic and linear functions which, prior to this work, were known only from indistinguishability obfuscation. \r\n    \r\n   To substantiate the practicality of our approach, we evaluate the performance a proof of concept implementation. For a group of $L = 1024$ users, encryption and decryption take roughly 50ms and 4ms, respectively, whereas a ciphertext is of size 6.7KB.",

    "abstract": "Embedded Multimedia Cards (eMMCs) provide a protected memory area called the Replay Protected Memory Block (RPMB). eMMCs are commonly used as storage media in modern smartphones. In order to protect these devices from unauthorized access, important data is stored in the RPMB area in an authenticated manner. Modification of the RPMB data requires a pre-shared authentication key. An unauthorized user cannot change the stored data. On modern devices, this pre-shared key is generated and used exclusively within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) preventing attackers from access.  In this paper, we investigate how the authentication key for RPMB is programmed on the eMMC. We found that this key can be extracted directly from the target memory chip. Once obtained, the authentication key can be used to manipulate stored data. In addition, poor implementation of certain security features, aimed at preventing replay attacks using RPMB on the host system can be broken by an attacker. We show how the authentication key can be extracted and how it can be used to break the anti-rollback protection to enable data restoration even after a data wipe operation has been completed. Our findings show that non-secure RPMB implementations can enable forensic investigators to break security features implemented on modern smartphones.",

    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables the computation of an arbitrary function over encrypted data without decrypting them. In particular, bootstrapping is a core building block of FHE which reduces the noise of a ciphertext thereby recovering the computational capability.\r\n\r\nThis paper introduces a new bootstrapping framework for the Fan-Vercauteren (FV) scheme, called the functional bootstrapping, providing more generic and advanced functionality than the ordinary bootstrapping method. More specifically, the functional bootstrapping allows us to evaluate an arbitrary function while removing the error of an input ciphertext. Therefore, we achieve better depth consumption and computational complexity as the evaluation of a circuit can be integrated as part of the functional bootstrapping procedure. In particular, our approach extends the functionality of FV since it is even applicable to functions between different plaintext spaces. \r\n\r\nAt the heart of our functional bootstrapping framework is a homomorphic Look-Up Table (LUT) evaluation method where we represent any LUT using only the operations supported by the FV scheme. Finally, we provide a proof-of-concept implementation and present benchmarks of the functional bootstrapping. In concrete examples, such as delta and sign functions, our functional bootstrapping takes about 46.5s or 171.4s for 9-bit or 13-bit plaintext modulus, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Decentralized Storage Network (DSN) is an emerging technology that challenges traditional cloud-based storage systems by consolidating storage capacities from independent providers and coordinating to provide decentralized storage and retrieval services. However, current DSNs face several challenges associated with data privacy and efficiency of the proof systems. To address these issues, we propose FileDES (Decentralized Encrypted Storage), which incorporates three essential elements: privacy preservation, scalable storage proof, and batch verification. FileDES provides encrypted data storage while maintaining data availability, with a scalable Proof of Encrypted Storage (PoES) algorithm that is resilient to Sybil and Generation attacks. Additionally, we introduce a rollup-based batch verification approach to simultaneously verify multiple files using publicly verifiable succinct proofs. We conducted a comparative evaluation on FileDES, Filecoin, Storj and Sia under various conditions, including a WAN composed of up to 120 geographically dispersed nodes. Our protocol outperforms the others in terms of proof generation/verification efficiency, storage costs, and scalability.",

    "abstract": "Equivalence class signatures (EQS; Asiacrypt '14), sign vectors of elements from a bilinear group.   Anyone can transform a signature on a vector to a signature on any multiple of that vector; signatures thus authenticate equivalence classes.  A transformed signature/message pair is indistinguishable from a random signature on a random message.  EQS have been used to efficiently instantiate (delegatable) anonymous credentials, (round-optimal) blind signatures, ring and group signatures, anonymous tokens and contact-tracing schemes, to name a few.\r\n\r\nThe original EQS construction (J. Crypto '19) is proven secure in the generic group model, and the first scheme from standard assumptions (PKC '18) satisfies a weaker model insufficient for most applications.  Two works (Asiacrypt '19, PKC '22) propose applicable schemes that assume trusted parameters.  Their unforgeability is argued via a security proof from standard (or non-interactive) assumptions.\r\n   \r\nWe show that their security proofs are flawed and explain the subtle issue.  While the schemes might be provable in the algebraic group model (AGM), we instead show that the original construction, which is more efficient and has found applications in many works, is secure in the AGM under a parametrized non-interactive hardness assumption.",

While threshold signatures have been extensively studied in the pre-quantum setting, they remain sparse from quantum-resilient assumptions.\r\n\r\nWe present the first efficient lattice-based threshold signatures with signature size 13 KiB and communication cost 40 KiB per user, supporting a threshold size as large as 1024 signers. We provide an accompanying high performance implementation. The security of the scheme is based on the same assumptions as Dilithium, a signature recently selected by NIST for standardisation which, as far as we know, cannot easily be made threshold efficiently.\r\n\r\nAll operations used during signing are due to symmetric primitives and simple lattice operations; in particular our scheme does not need heavy tools such as threshold fully homomorphic encryption or homomorphic trapdoor commitments as in prior constructions. The key technical idea is to use one-time additive masks to mitigate the leakage of the partial signing keys through partial signatures.",

    "abstract": "A list polynomial commitment scheme (LPC) is a polynomial commitment scheme with a relaxed binding property. Namely, in an LPC setting, a commitment to a function $f(X)$ can be opened to a list of low-degree polynomials close to $f(X)$ (w.r.t. the relative Hamming distance and over a domain $D$). The scheme also allows opening one of the polynomials of the list at an arbitrary point $x$ and convincing a verifier that one of the polynomials in the list evaluates to the purported value.\r\n\r\nVortex is a list polynomial commitment, obtained through a modification of Ligero (CCS 2017), inspired by the schemes of Brakedown (Crypto 2023), batch-FRI (FOCS 2020), and RedShift (CCS 2022). Concerning one application of Vortex, for a witness of size $N$, the messages between the prover and the verifier are of size $O(N^{1/2})$. Vortex is a core component of the SNARK used by the prover of Linea (Consensys). This paper provides a complete security analysis for Vortex. We use a general compiler to build an Argument of Knowledge (AoK) by combining our list polynomial commitment and a polynomial-IOP (PIOP).\r\n\r\nThe approach is similar to combining a PIOP with a polynomial commitment scheme and has a soundness loss only linear in the list size. This overcomes a previous limitation in the standard compiler from a generic PIOP and a list polynomial commitment scheme to an interactive argument of knowledge, which suffers from a soundness loss of $\\mathcal{O}(|L|^r)$ (where $|L|$ is the list size and $r$ is the number of interactions between the prover and the verifier in the PIOP).",

    "abstract": "High-performance crypto-engines have become crucial components in modern System-On-Chip (SoC) architectures across platforms, from servers to edge-IoTs\u2019. Alas, their secure operation faces a significant obstacle caused by information-leakage accessed through Side-Channel Analysis (SCA). Adversaries exploit statistical-analysis techniques on measured (e.g.,) power and timing signatures generated during (e.g.,) encryption, extracting secrets. Mathematical countermeasures against such attacks often impose substantial power-performance-area overheads. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) techniques provide power-efficiency by varying power consumption according to workload; these modulations are called power-states. Unintentionally, DVFS introduces new inherent weaknesses exploitable by malicious actors: power-states leak information in both power and timing side-channels, measurable in software and hardware. We introduce a method to increase side-channel resistance using integrated voltage regulators and DVFS: (1) Pushing known prior-art in the topic to Ultra Low Power (ULP) regime (2) For the first time introducing a mechanism to aid in counteracting the inherent weakness of DVFS in SCA (3) Providing measurements performed on 40nm process ULP PLS15 test-chip down at 580 mV power-supply (4) Offering improved and parameterized resistance to remote-timing vulnerabilities inherent to DVFS. We present various results and perform a detailed analysis while comparing performance and security to prior-art. Importantly, our solution is\r\nconfigurable in terms of security, maintaining degrees-of-freedom for power-optimization of DVFS.",

    "abstract": "In the realm of privacy-preserving blockchain applications such as Zcash, oblivious message retrieval (OMR) enables recipients to privately access messages directed to them on blockchain nodes (or bulletin board servers). OMR prevents servers from linking a message and its corresponding recipient's address, thereby safeguarding recipient privacy. Several OMR schemes have emerged recently to meet the demands of these privacy-centric blockchains; however, we observe that existing solutions exhibit shortcomings in various critical aspects and may only achieve certain objectives inefficiently, sometimes relying on trusted hardware, thereby impacting their practical utility. This work introduces a novel OMR protocol, HomeRun,  that leverages two semi-honest, non-colluding servers to excel in both performance and security attributes as compared to the current state-of-the-art.\r\n\r\nHomeRun stands out by providing unlinkability across multiple requests for the same recipient's address. Moreover, it does not impose a limit on the number of pertinent messages that can be received by a recipient, which thwarts ``message balance exhaustion'' attacks and enhances system usability. HomeRun also empowers servers to regularly delete the retrieved messages and the associated auxiliary data, which mitigates the constantly increasing computation costs and storage costs incurred by servers. Remarkably, none of the existing solutions offer all of these features collectively. Finally, thanks to its judicious use of highly efficient cryptographic building blocks, HomeRun is highly performant: Specifically, the total runtime of servers in HomeRun is $3830 \\times$ less than that in the work by Liu et al. (CRYPTO '22) based on fully-homomorphic encryption, and at least $1459 \\times$ less than that in the design by Madathil et al. (USENIX Security '22) based on two semi-honest and non-colluding servers, using a single thread in a WAN setting.",

    "abstract": "Auctions, a long-standing method of trading goods and services, are a promising use case for decentralized finance. However, due to the inherent transparency property of blockchains, current sealed-bid auction implementations on smart contracts requires a bidder to send at least two transactions to the underlying blockchain: a bidder must first commit their bid in the first transaction during the bidding period and reveal their bid in the second transaction once the revealing period starts. In addition, the smart contract often requires a deposit to incentivize bidders to reveal their bids, rendering unnecessary financial burdens and risks to bidders. We address these drawbacks by enforcing delayed execution in the blockchain execution layer to all transactions. In short, the blockchain only accepts encrypted transactions, and when the blockchain has finalized an encrypted transaction, the consensus group decrypts and executes it. This architecture enables ZeroAuction, a sealed-bid auction smart contract with zero deposit requirement. ZeroAuction relies on the blockchain enhanced with delayed execution to hide and bind the bids within the encrypted transactions and, after a delay period, reveals them automatically by decrypting and executing the transactions. Because a bidder only needs to interact with the blockchain once instead of two times to participate in the auction, ZeroAuction significantly reduces the latency overhead along with eliminating the deposit requirement.",

    "abstract": "The main goal of this work is to construct authenticated encryption (AE) that is both committing and leakage-resilient. As a first approach for this we consider generic composition as a well-known method for constructing AE schemes. While the leakage resilience of generic composition schemes has already been analyzed by Barwell et al. (AC'17), for committing security this is not the case. We fill this gap by providing a separate analysis of the generic composition paradigms with respect to committing security, giving both positive and negative results: By means of a concrete attack, we show that Encrypt-then-MAC is not committing. Furthermore, we prove that Encrypt-and-MAC is committing, given that the underlying schemes satisfy security notions we introduce for this purpose. We later prove these new notions achievable by providing schemes that satisfy them. MAC-then-Encrypt turns out to be more difficult due to the fact that the tag is not outputted alongside the ciphertext as it is done for the other two composition methods. Nevertheless, we give a detailed heuristic analysis of MAC-then-Encrypt with respect to committing security, leaving a definite result as an open task for future work. Our results, in combination with the fact that only Encrypt-then-MAC yields leakage-resilient AE schemes, show that one cannot obtain AE schemes that are both committing and leakage-resilient via generic composition. As a second approach for constructing committing and leakage-resilient AE, we develop a generic transformation that turns an arbitrary AE scheme into one that fulfills both properties. The transformation relies on a keyed function that is both binding, i.e., it is hard to find key-input pairs that result in the same output, and leakage-resilient pseudorandom.",

    "abstract": "Abelian group actions appear in several areas of cryptography, especially isogeny-based post-quantum cryptography.  A natural problem is to relate the analogues of the computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) and discrete logarithm (DLog) problems for abelian group actions.\r\nGalbraith, Panny, Smith and Vercauteren (Mathematical Cryptology '21) gave a quantum reduction of DLog to CDH, assuming a CDH oracle with perfect correctness.  Montgomery and Zhandry (Asiacrypt '22, best paper award) showed how to convert an unreliable CDH oracle into one that is correct with overwhelming probability.  However, while a theoretical breakthrough, their reduction is quite inefficient: if the CDH oracle is correct with probability $\\epsilon$ then their algorithm to amplify the success requires on the order of $1/\\epsilon^{21}$ calls to the CDH oracle.\r\n\r\nWe revisit this line of work and give a much simpler and tighter algorithm. Our method only takes on the order of $1/\\epsilon^{4}$ CDH oracle calls and is conceptually simpler than the Montgomery-Zhandry reduction.  Our algorithm is also fully black-box, whereas the Montgomery-Zhandry algorithm is slightly non-black-box. Our main tool is a thresholding technique that replaces the comparison of distributions in Montgomery-Zhandry with testing equality of thresholded sets.",

    "abstract": "Function secret sharing (FSS) for a class $\\cal{F}$ allows to split a secret function $f \\in \\cal{F}$ into (succinct) secret shares $f_0,f_1$, such that for all $x\\in \\{0,1\\}^n$ it holds $f_0(x)-f_1(x)=f(x)$. FSS has numerous applications, including private database queries, nearest neighbour search, private heavy hitters and secure computation in the preprocessing model, where the supported class $\\cal{F}$ translates to richness in the application. Unfortunately, concretely efficient FSS constructions are only known for very limited function classes.\r\n\r\nIn this work we introduce the notion of pseudorandom generators with encoded-output homomorphism (EOH-PRGs), and give direct FSS constructions for bit-fixing predicates, branching programs and more based on this primitive. Further, we give constructions of FSS for deterministic finite automatas (DFAs) from a KDM secure variant of EOH-PRGs. \r\n\r\n- New abstractions. Following the work of Alamati et al.(EUROCRYPT '19), who classify minicrypt primitives with algebraic structure and their applications, we capture  the essence of our FSS constructions in the notion of EOH-PRG, paving the road towards future efficiency improvements via new instantiations of this primitive. The abstraction of EOH-PRG and its instantiations may be of independent interest, as it is an approximate substitution of an ideal homomorphic PRG.\r\n- Better efficiency. We show that EOH-PRGs can be instantiated from LWE and a small-exponent variant of the DCR assumption. A theoretical analysis of our instantiations suggest  efficiency improvements over the state of the art both in terms of key size and evaluation time: We show that our FSS instantiations lead to smaller key sizes, improving over previous constructions by a factor of $3.5$ and more. While for bit-fixing predicates our FSS constructions show comparable or mildly improved run time (depending on the instantiation), we achieve considerable improvements for branching programs by avoiding the expensive generic transformation via universal circuits, shaving off a factor of $w$ and more in the number of abstract operations, where $w$ corresponds to an upper bound on the width of the underlying class of branching programs.  \r\n- New constructions. We show that our instantiations of EOH-PRGs additionally support a form of KDM-security, without requiring an additional circular-security assumption. Based on this, we give the first FSS construction for DFAs which supports the evaluation of inputs of a-priori unbounded length without relying on FHE. \r\n- Applications. We outline applications of our FSS constructions  including pattern matching with wild cards, image matching, nearest neighbor search and regular expression matching.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Helium, a novel framework that supports scalable secure multiparty computation (MPC) for lightweight participants and tolerates churn. Helium relies on multiparty homomorphic encryption (MHE) as its core building block. While MHE schemes have been well studied in theory, prior works fall short of addressing critical considerations paramount for adoption such as supporting resource-constrained and unstably connected participants. In this work, we systematize the requirements of MHE-based MPC protocols from a practical lens, and we propose a novel execution mechanism that addresses those considerations. We implement this execution mechanism in Helium, which makes it the first implemented framework to support MPC under network churn based solely on cryptographic assumptions. We show that a Helium network of $30$ parties connected with $100$Mbits/s links and experiencing a system-wide churn rate of $40$ failures per minute can compute the product between a fixed $512\\times512$ secret matrix (e.g., a collectively-trained private model) and a fresh secret vector (e.g., a feature vector) $8.3$ times per second. This is $\\sim\\!\\!1500$ times faster than a state-of-the-art MPC framework operating under no churn.",

A recent trend is the introduction of matrix-multiplication accelerators to CPUs by manufacturers such as IBM, Intel and ARM, some of which have not launched commercially yet. Apple's systems-on-chip (SoCs) for its mobile phones, tablets and personal computers include a proprietary, undocumented CPU-coupled matrix multiplication coprocessor called AMX. In this paper, we leverage AMX to accelerate the post-quantum lattice-based cryptosystems Saber and FrodoKEM, and benchmark their performance on Apple M1 and M3 SoCs. We propose a variant of the Toeplitz Matrix-Vector Product algorithm for polynomial multiplication, which sets new speed records for Saber using AMX (up to 13% for the main KEM operations, and 151% for matrix-vector multiplication of polynomials). For FrodoKEM, we set new speed records with our AMX implementation (up to 21% for the main KEM operations, and 124% for matrix multiplication, with even greater improvements for $4 \\times$-batching). Such speedups are relative to our optimized NEON implementation, also presented here, which improves upon the state-of-the-art implementation for ARMv8 CPUs.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, cryptocurrencies have garnered attention from academia and industry alike, fostering a diverse blockchain ecosystem and novel applications. The inception of bridges improved interoperability, enabling asset transfers across different blockchains to capitalize on their unique features. Despite their surge in popularity and the emergence of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), trustless bridge protocols remain inefficient, either relaying too much information (e.g., light-client-based bridges) or demanding expensive computation (e.g., zk-based bridges). These inefficiencies arise because existing bridges securely prove a transaction's on-chain inclusion on another blockchain. Yet this is unnecessary as off-chain solutions, like payment and state channels, permit safe transactions without on-chain publication. However, existing bridges do not support the verification of off-chain payments.\r\n\r\nThis paper fills this gap by introducing the concept of Pay2Chain bridges that leverage the advantages of off-chain solutions like payment channels to overcome current bridges' limitations. Our proposed Pay2Chain bridge, named Alba, facilitates the efficient, secure, and trustless execution of conditional payments or smart contracts on a target blockchain based on off-chain events. Alba, besides its technical advantages, enriches the source blockchain's ecosystem by facilitating DeFi applications, multi-asset payment channels, and optimistic stateful off-chain computation.\r\n\r\nWe formalize the security of Alba against Byzantine adversaries in the UC framework and complement it with a game theoretic analysis. We further introduce formal scalability metrics to demonstrate Alba\u2019s efficiency. Our empirical evaluation confirms Alba efficiency in terms of communication complexity and on-chain costs, with its optimistic case incurring only twice the cost of a standard Ethereum transaction of token ownership transfer.",

    "abstract": "Shared randomness in blockchain can expand its support for randomized applications and can also help strengthen its security. Many existing blockchains rely on external randomness beacons for shared randomness, but this approach reduces fault tolerance, increases latency, and complicates application development. An alternate approach is to let the blockchain validators generate fresh shared randomness themselves once for every block. We refer to such a design as the \\emph{on-chain} randomness. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we design an efficient on-chain randomness protocol for Byzantine fault-tolerance based Proof-of-Stake blockchains with weighted validators. A key component of our protocol is a weighted verifiable unpredictable function (VUF). The notable feature of our weighted VUF is that the computation and communication costs of parties are independent of their weight. This is crucial for scalability of on-chain randomness where we repeatedly evaluate the weighted VUF in quick succession. We also design a new scalable publicly verifiable secret sharing~(PVSS) scheme with aggregatable transcript and use it to design a distributed key generation~(DKG) protocol for our VUF. We implemented our schemes on top of Aptos, a proof-of-stake blockchain deployed in production, conducted an end-to-end evaluation with 112 validators and a total weight of up to 4053. In this setup, our on-chain randomness protocol adds only 133 milliseconds of latency compared to a protocol without randomness. We also demonstrate the performance improvements of our design through rigorous comparison with baseline methods.",

    "abstract": "Masking is one of the most popular countermeasures to side-\r\nchannel attacks, because it can offer provable security. However, depend-\r\ning on the adversary\u2019s model, useful security guarantees can be hard\r\nto provide. At first, masking has been shown secure against t-threshold\r\nprobing adversaries by Ishai et al. at Crypto\u201903. It has then been shown\r\nsecure in the more generic random probing model by Duc et al. at Euro-\r\ncrypt\u201914. Prouff and Rivain have introduced the noisy leakage model to\r\ncapture more realistic leakage at Eurocrypt\u201913. Reduction from noisy\r\nleakage to random probing has been introduced by Duc et al. at Euro-\r\ncrypt\u201914, and security guarantees were improved for both models by\r\nPrest et al. at Crypto\u201919, Duc et al. in Eurocrypt\u201915/J. Cryptol\u201919,\r\nand Masure and Standaert at Crypto\u201923. Unfortunately, as it turns out,\r\nwe found that previous proofs in either random probing or noisy leakage\r\nmodels are flawed, and such flaws do not appear easy to fix.\r\nIn this work, we show that the Doeblin coefficient allows one to over-\r\ncome these flaws. In fact, it yields optimal reductions from noisy leakage\r\nto random probing, thereby providing a correct and usable metric to\r\nproperly ground security proofs. This shows the inherent inevitable cost\r\nof a reduction from the noisy leakages to the random probing model. We\r\nshow that it can also be used to derive direct formal security proofs using\r\nthe subsequence decomposition of Prouff and Rivain.",

    "abstract": "We propose a modification to the fork choice rule of proof-of-work blockchains.  Instead of choosing the heaviest chain, we choose the chain with the most intrinsic work. The intrinsic work of a block is roughly the number of zeroes at the front of its hash. This modification allows us to safely decrease the confirmations required, yielding a $28.5\\%$ improvement in confirmation delay or, dually, safely increase the block production rate, yielding a $16.3\\%$ improvement in throughput, as compared to the vanilla Bitcoin proof-of-work fork choice rule. Our modification is at the level of the proof-of-work inequality, and thus can be composed with any other methods to improve latency or throughput that have been proposed in the literature. We report the experimental findings by measuring them on a production-grade implementation of our system, whose testnet is already deployed in the wild. Lastly, we formally prove the security of our new protocol in the Bitcoin Backbone model.",

    "abstract": "We focus on the problem of constructing fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes that achieve some meaningful notion of adaptive chosen-ciphertext security beyond CCA1. Towards this, we propose a new notion, called security against verified chosen-ciphertext attack (vCCA). The idea behind it is to ascertain integrity of the ciphertext by imposing a strong control on the evaluation algorithm. Essentially, we require that a ciphertext obtained by the use of homomorphic evaluation must be \"linked\" to the original input ciphertexts. We formalize the vCCA notion in two equivalent formulations; the first is in the indistinguishability paradigm, the second follows the non-malleability simulation-based approach, and is a generalization of the targeted malleability introduced by Boneh et al. in 2012.\r\n\r\n    We strengthen the credibility of our definitions by exploring relations to existing security notions for homomorphic encryption schemes, namely CCA1, RCCA, FuncCPA, CCVA, and HCCA. We prove that vCCA security is the strongest notion known so far, that can be achieved by an FHE scheme; in particular, vCCA is strictly stronger than CCA1.\r\n\r\n    Finally, we provide a general transformation, that takes any CPA-secure FHE scheme and makes it vCCA-secure. Our transformation first turns an FHE scheme into a CCA2-secure scheme where a part of the ciphertext retains the homomorphic properties and then extends it with a succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (SNARK) to verifiably control the evaluation algorithm. In fact, we obtain four general variation of this transformation. We handle both the asymmetric and the symmetric key FHE schemes, and for each we give two variations differing in whether the ciphertext integrity can be verified publicly or requires the secret key. We use well-known techniques to achieve CCA security in the first step of our transformation. In the asymmetric case, we use the double encryption paradigm, and in the symmetric case, we use Encrypt-then-MAC techniques. Furthermore, our transformation also gives the first CCA-secure FHE scheme based on bootstrapping techniques.",

    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a powerful tool for performing privacy-preserving analytics over encrypted data. A promising method for FHE over real and complex numbers is approximate homomorphic encryption, instantiated with the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme. The CKKS scheme enables efficient evaluation for many privacy-preserving machine learning applications. While the efficiency advantages of CKKS are clear, there is currently a lot of confusion on how to securely instantiate the scheme for any given application, especially after secret-key recovery attacks were discovered by Li and Micciancio (EUROCRYPT'21) for the $IND-CPA^D$ setting, i.e., where decryption results are shared with other parties. On the one hand, the generic definition of $IND-CPA^D$ is application-agnostic and often requires impractically large parameters. On the other hand, practical CKKS implementations target specific applications and use tighter parameters. A good illustration are the recent secret-key recovery attacks against a CKKS implementation in the OpenFHE library by Guo et al. (USENIX Security'24). These attacks misuse the library by employing different circuits during parameter estimation and run-time computation, yet they do not violate the generic (application-agnostic) $IND-CPA^D$ definition.\r\n\r\nTo address this confusion, we introduce the notion of application-aware homomorphic encryption and devise related security definitions, which correspond more closely to how homomorphic encryption schemes are implemented and used in practice. We then formulate the guidelines for implementing the application-aware homomorphic encryption model to achieve $IND-CPA^D$ security for practical applications of CKKS. We also show that our application-aware model can be used for secure, efficient instantiation of exact homomorphic encryption schemes.",

    "abstract": "Anonymous message delivery, as in privacy-preserving blockchain and private messaging applications, needs to protect recipient metadata: eavesdroppers should not be able to link messages to their recipients. This raises the question: how can untrusted servers assist in delivering the pertinent messages to each recipient, without learning which messages are addressed to whom?\r\n\r\nRecent work constructed Oblivious Message Retrieval (OMR) protocols that outsource the message detection and retrieval in a privacy-preserving way, using homomorphic encryption. Their construction exhibits significant costs in computation per message scanned (${\\sim}0.1$ second), as well as in the size of the associated messages (${\\sim}1$kB overhead) and public keys (${\\sim}132$kB).\r\n\r\nThis work constructs more efficient OMR schemes, by replacing the LWE-based clue encryption of prior works with a Ring-LWE variant, and utilizing the resulting flexibility to improve several components of the scheme. We thus devise, analyze, and benchmark two protocols:\r\n\r\nThe first protocol focuses on improving the detector runtime, using a new retrieval circuit that can be homomorphically evaluated $15$x faster than the prior work.\r\n  \r\nThe second protocol focuses on reducing the communication costs, by designing a different homomorphic decryption circuit that allows the parameter of the Ring-LWE encryption to be set such that the public key size is about $235$x smaller than the prior work, and the message size is roughly $1.6$x smaller. The runtime of this second construction is ${\\sim}40.0$ms per message, still more than $2.5$x faster than prior works.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel bi-primality test to determine whether $N=pq$ is the product of two primes on any RSA modulus in which we relaxed the restriction, $p\\equiv q \\equiv 3 \\Mod{4}$, that was assumed in most of current bi-primality tests. Our bi-primality test is generalized from Lucas primality test to the bi-prime case. Our test always accepts when $p$ and $q$ are both prime, and otherwise accepts with probability at most $1/2$. In addition, we also prove that the Boneh-Franklin's bi-primality test accepts composite with probability at most $1/4$ instead of $1/2$, if we add an additional condition $\\gcd(N, p+q-1)=1$. Moreover, we design a multiparty protocol against of static semi-honest adversaries in the hybrid model and provide a security proof. We then implement the proposed protocol and run in a single thread on a laptop which turned out with average 224 seconds execution time, given that $N$ is around $2048$-bit.",

    "abstract": "Sharding enhances blockchain scalability by dividing the network into shards, each managing specific unspent transaction outputs or accounts. As an introduced new transaction type, cross-shard transactions pose a critical challenge to the security and efficiency of sharding blockchains. Currently, there is a lack of a generic sharding blockchain consensus pattern that achieves both security and low overhead.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present Kronos, a secure sharding blockchain consensus achieving optimized overhead. In particular, we propose a new secure sharding blockchain consensus pattern, based on a buffer managed jointly by shard members. Valid transactions are transferred to the payee via the buffer, while invalid ones are rejected through happy or unhappy paths. Kronos is proved to achieve security with atomicity under malicious clients while maintaining optimal intra-shard overhead. Efficient rejection even requires no Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) protocol execution in happy paths, and the cost in unhappy paths is still not higher than a two-phase commit. Besides, we propose secure cross-shard certification methods. Handling b transactions, Kronos is proved to achieve cross-shard communication with low cross-shard overhead O(n b \\lambda) (n for the shard size and \\lambda for the security parameter). Notably, Kronos imposes no restrictions on BFT and does not rely on timing assumptions, offering optional constructions in various modules. Kronos could serve as a universal framework for enhancing the performance and scalability of existing BFT protocols. Kronos supports generic models, including asynchronous networks, and can increase the throughput by several orders of magnitude.\r\n\r\nWe implement Kronos using two prominent BFT protocols: asynchronous Speeding Dumbo (NDSS'22) and partially synchronous Hotstuff (PODC'19). Extensive experiments (over up to 1000 AWS EC2 nodes across 4 AWS regions) demonstrate Kronos scales the consensus nodes to thousands, achieving a substantial throughput of 320 ktx/sec with 2.0 sec latency. Compared with the past solutions, Kronos outperforms, achieving up to a 12$\\times$ improvement in throughput and a 50% reduction in latency when cross-shard transactions dominate the workload.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce a family of asymmetric cryptographic functions based on dynamic number theoretic transformations with multiple rounds of modular arithmetic to enhance diffusion and difficulty of inversion. This function acts as a basic cryptographic building block for a novel communication-efficient zero-knowledge crypto-system. The system as defined exhibits partial homomorphism and behaves as an additive positive accumulator. By using a novel technique to constructively embed lattice problems in a nested fashion, the dimensionality and overall complexity of the lattice structure is increased.\r\nThis linked lattice framework obscures internal structure and mitigates cryptanalysis by applying a novel \u2019noisy roots\u2019 technique. By relaxing the need for specifically correct nth \u03c9 roots in a given field, we apply offset values to create a framework of consisting of a set of uniquely transforming but arithmetically compatible NTTs. We provide specific parameters for conjectured NIST level V security. Communication costs are extremely low at 288-bytes per public key and 144-bytes per cipher-text or digital signature. Example protocols for key agreement, secure data exchange, additive accumulation, and digital signatures are provided.\r\nPeer review is in preliminary stages at time of dissemination.

    "abstract": "Typical results in  multi-party computation (in short, MPC) capture faulty parties by assuming a threshold adversary corrupting parties actively and/or fail-corrupting. These corruption types are, however, inadequate for capturing correct parties that might suffer temporary network failures and/or localized faults - these are particularly relevant for MPC over large, global scale networks. Omission faults and general adversary structures have been proposed as more suitable alternatives. However, to date, there is no characterization of the feasibility landscape combining the above ramifications of fault types and patterns.\r\nIn this work we provide a tight characterization of feasibility of MPC in the presence of general adversaries - characterized by an adversary structure - that combine omission and active corruption. To this front we first provide a tight characterization of feasibility for Byzantine agreement (BA), a key tool in MPC protocols - this BA result can be of its own separate significance. \r\nSubsequently, we demonstrate that the common techniques employed in the threshold MPC literature to deal with omission corruptions do not work in the general adversary setting, not even for proving bounds that would appear straightforward, e.g,  sufficiency of the well known $Q^3$ condition on omission-only general adversaries. Nevertheless we provide a new protocol that implements general adversary MPC under a surprisingly complex, yet tight as we prove, bound. All our results are for the classical synchronous model of computation.\r\nAs a contribution of independent interest, our work puts forth, for the first time, a formal treatment of general-adversary MPC with (active and) omission corruptions in Canetti's universal composition framework.",

    "abstract": "We observe that most fixed-party distributed protocols can be rewritten by replacing a party with a ledger (such as a blockchain system) and the authenticated channel communication between parties with cross-chain relayers. This transform is useful because blockchain systems are always online and have battle-tested security assumptions.  We provide a definitional framework that captures this analogy.  We model the transform formally, and posit and prove a generic metatheorem that allows translating all theorems from the party setting into theorems in the emulated setting, while preserving analogies between party honesty and ledger security.  In the heart of our proof lies a reduction-based simulation argument.  As an example, our metatheorem can be used to construct a consensus protocol on top of other blockchains, creating a reliable rollup that assumes only the majority of the underlying layer-1s are secure.",

    "abstract": "Battery-operated applications have been ubiquitous all over the world ranging from power-intensive electric cars down to low-power smart terminals and embedded devices. Meanwhile, serious incidents around batteries such as swelling, fire, and explosion have been witnessed, which resulted in horribly huge financial and even life loss. People used to attribute such aftermaths to unintentional design mistakes or insufficient quality inspection of original battery manufacturers. However, this is not fair anymore today given the convoluted battery supply chain and the extended cyber-physical attack surface of battery management systems (BMS). In this paper, we will focus on the authenticity and assurance of prevalent (Li-ion) battery instances. We look into battery authenticity by modeling the contemporary battery supply chain and discussing practical concerns such as rewrapping and recycling in-depth at each stage. As for battery assurance, we consider emerging attack vectors that can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the microelectronic BMS. Besides, real-world attack examples are highlighted to reflect the capabilities of advanced adversaries. Moreover, promising countermeasures regarding the detection and avoidance of threats on both battery authenticity and assurance are presented, such that researchers will gain insights into how the problem could be addressed/alleviated. We also provide our perspectives on the vulnerabilities of battery systems and their consequent impacts as well as our point of view on potential countermeasure techniques.",

    "abstract": "Quantum devices offer a highly useful function - that is generating random numbers in a non-deterministic way since the measurement of a quantum state is not deterministic. This means that quantum devices can be constructed that generate qubits in a uniform superposition and then measure the state of those qubits. If the preparation of the qubits in a uniform superposition is unbiased, then quantum computers can be used to create high entropy, secure random numbers. Typically, preparing and measuring such quantum systems requires more time compared to classical pseudo random number generators (PRNGs) which are inherently deterministic algorithms. Therefore, the typical use of quantum random number generators (QRNGs) is to provide high entropy secure seeds for PRNGs. Quantum annealing (QA) is a type of analog quantum computation that is a relaxed form of adiabatic quantum computation and uses quantum fluctuations in order to search for ground state solutions of a programmable Ising model. Here we present extensive experimental random number results from a D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer, totaling over 20 billion bits of QA measurements, which is significantly larger than previous D-Wave QA random number generator studies. Current quantum annealers are susceptible to noise from environmental sources and calibration errors, and are not in general unbiased samplers. Therefore, it is of interest to quantify whether noisy quantum annealers can effectively function as an unbiased QRNG. The amount of data that was collected from the quantum annealer allows a comprehensive analysis of the random bits to be performed using the NIST SP 800-22 Rev 1a testsuite, as well as min-entropy estimates from NIST SP 800-90B. The randomness tests show that the generated random bits from the D-Wave 2000Q are biased, and not unpredictable random bit sequences. With no server-side sampling post-processing, the $1$ microsecond annealing time measurements had a min-entropy of $0.824$.",

    "abstract": "This note examines a nuance in the methods employed for counting the adversarial online complexity in the security proofs of duplex-based  modes, with a focus on authenticated encryption. A recent study by Gilbert et al., reveals an attack on a broad class of duplex-based authenticated encryption modes. In particular, their approach to quantifying the adversarial online complexity, which capture realistic attack scenarios, includes certain queries in the count which are not in the security proofs. This note analyzes these differences and concludes that the attack of Gilbert et al, for certain parameter choices, matches the security bound.",

    "abstract": "The recent surge of distribute technologies caused an increasing interest towards threshold signature protocols, that peaked with the recent NIST First Call for Multi-Party Threshold Schemes. \r\nSince its introduction, the Fiat-Shamir Transform has been the most popular way to design standard digital signature schemes. \r\nMany threshold signature schemes are designed in a way that recalls the structure of digital signatures created using Fiat Shamir,  by having the signers generate a common commitment, compute the challenge as the hash of it, and then jointly create the response.\r\nIn this work we formalize this approach. In particular we introduce the notion of threshold identification scheme and threshold sigma protocol. Next, we introduce the concept of generalized Fiat-Shamir transform, that links the security of the threshold signature with the underlying threshold identification protocol. Our framework seeks to be an alternative, easier way to design concurrently secure threshold digital signatures and we show its potentiality providing an alternative security proof for Sparkle, a recent threshold Schnorr signature, and GRASS, a full threshold signature based on cryptographic group actions.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study two problems: oblivious compression and decompression of ciphertexts. In oblivious compression, a server holds a set of ciphertexts with a subset of encryptions of zeroes whose positions are only known to the client. The goal is for the server to effectively compress the ciphertexts obliviously, while preserving the non-zero plaintexts and without learning the plaintext values. For oblivious decompression, the client, instead, succinctly encodes a sequence of plaintexts such that the server may decode encryptions of all plaintexts value, but the zeroes may be replaced with arbitrary values. We present solutions to both problems that construct lossless compressions only 5% more than the optimal minimum using only additive homomorphism. The crux of both algorithms involve embedding ciphertexts as random linear systems that are efficiently solvable.\r\n\r\nUsing our compression schemes, we obtain state-of-the-art schemes for batch private information retrieval (PIR) where a client wishes to privately retrieve multiple entries from a server-held database in one query. We show that our compression schemes may be used to reduce communication by up to 30% for batch PIR in both the single- and two-server settings.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we study labeled private set intersection (PSI) in the unbalanced setting where one party's set is significantly smaller than the other party's set and each entry has associated data. By utilizing our novel compression algorithm, we present a protocol with 65-88% reduction in communication with comparable computation compared to prior works.",

    "abstract": "Somewhere statistically binding (SSB) hashing allows us to sample a special hashing key such that the digest statistically binds the input at $m$ secret locations. This hash function is said to be somewhere extractable (SE) if there is an additional trapdoor that allows the extraction of the input bits at the $m$ locations from the digest. \r\n\r\n     Devadas, Goyal, Kalai, and Vaikuntanathan (FOCS 2022) introduced a variant of somewhere extractable hashing called rate-1 fully local SE hash functions. The rate-1 requirement states that the size of the digest is $m + \\mathsf{poly}(\\lambda)$ (where $\\lambda$ is the security parameter). The fully local property requires that for any index $i$, there is a \"very short\" opening showing that $i$-th bit of the hashed input is equal to $b$ for some $b \\in \\{0,1\\}$. The size of this opening is required to be independent of $m$ and in particular, this means that its size is independent of the size of the digest. Devadas et al. gave such a construction from Learning with Errors (LWE).\r\n\r\n     In this work, we give a construction of a rate-1 fully local somewhere extractable hash function from Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) and BARGs. Under the same assumptions, we give constructions of rate-1 BARG and RAM SNARG with partial input soundness whose proof sizes are only matched by prior constructions based on LWE.",

    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables computation on encrypted data, holding immense potential for enhancing data privacy and security in various applications. Presently, FHE adoption is hindered by slow computation times, caused by data being encrypted into large polynomials. Optimized FHE libraries and hardware acceleration are emerging to tackle this performance bottleneck. Often, these libraries implement the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) algorithm for efficient polynomial multiplication. Existing implementations mostly focus on the case where the polynomials are defined over a power-of-two cyclotomic ring, allowing to make use of the simpler Cooley-Tukey NTT. However, generalized cyclotomics have several benefits in the BGV FHE scheme, including more SIMD plaintext slots and a simpler bootstrapping algorithm.\r\n\r\nWe present a hardware architecture for the NTT targeting generalized cyclotomics within the context of the BGV FHE scheme. We explore different non-power-of-two NTT algorithms, including the Prime-Factor, Rader, and Bluestein NTTs. Our most efficient architecture targets the 21845-th cyclotomic polynomial --- a practical parameter for BGV --- with ideal properties for use with a combination of the Prime-Factor and Rader algorithms. The design achieves high throughput with optimized resource utilization, by leveraging parallel processing, pipelining, and reusing processing elements. Compared to Wu et al.'s VLSI architecture of the Bluestein NTT, our approach showcases 2$\\times$ to 5$\\times$ improved throughput and area efficiency. Simulation and implementation results on an AMD Alveo U250 FPGA demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed hardware design for FHE.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a leakage-resilient pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) design that leverages the rekeying techniques of the PSV-Enc encryption scheme and the superposition property of the Superposition-Tweak-Key (STK) framework. The random seed of the PRNG is divided into two parts; one part is used as an ephemeral key that changes every two calls to a tweakable block cipher (TBC), and the other part is used as a static long-term key. Using the superposition property, we show that it is possible to eliminate observable leakage by only masking the static key. Thus, our proposal itself can be seen as a superposition of masking and rekeying. We show that our observations can be used to design an unpredictable-with-leakage PRNG as long as the static key is protected, and the ephemeral key cannot be attacked with 2 traces. Our construction enjoys better theoretical security arguments than PSV-Enc; better Time-Data trade-off and leakage assumptions, using the recently popularized unpredictability with leakage. We verify our proposal by performing Test Vector Leakage Assessment (TVLA) on an STK-based TBC (\\deoxys) operated with a fixed key and a dynamic random tweak. Our results show that while the protection of the static key is non-trivial, it only requires $\\approx 10\\%$ overhead for first-order protection in the most conservative setting, unlike traditional masking which may require significant overheads of $300\\%$ or more.",

    "abstract": "Symmetric ratchets and one-way key chains play a vital role in numerous important security protocols such as TLS 1.3, DTLS 1.3, QUIC, Signal, MLS, EDHOC, OSCORE, and Apple PQ3. Despite the crucial role they play, very little is known about their security properties. This paper categorizes and examines different ratchet constructions, offering a comprehensive overview of their security. Our analysis reveals notable distinctions between different types of one-way key chains. Notably, the type of ratchet used by TLS 1.3, Signal, and PQ3 exhibit a significant number of weak keys, an unexpectedly high rate of key collisions surpassing birthday attack expectations, and a predictable shrinking key space susceptible to novel Time-Memory Trade-Off (TMTO) attacks with complexity $\\approx N^{1/4}$. Consequently, the security level provided by e.g., TLS 1.3 is significantly lower than anticipated. To address these concerns, we analyze the aforementioned protocols and provide numerous concrete recommendations for enhancing their security, as well as guidance for future security protocol design.",

Two such protocols have emerged as candidates for standardization at the IETF: Prio (NSDI 2017) for general-purpose statistics; and Poplar (IEEE S&P 2021) for heavy hitters, where the goal is to compute the most popular inputs held by users without learning the inputs themselves. While each of these protocols is well-suited to certain applications, there remain a number of use cases identified by IETF for which neither Prio nor Poplar is practical.\r\n\r\nWe introduce Mastic, a protocol for the following functionality: each of a large number of clients holds an input (e.g., a URL) and its corresponding weight (e.g., page load time); for a given candidate input (or prefix), a small number of non-colluding servers wish to securely aggregate the weights of clients that hold that input (or some input with that prefix), without learning the weights or which client holds which input. This functionality makes two new classes of applications possible. The first is a natural generalization of heavy hitters we call weighted heavy-hitters. The second is an enhancement of Prio-style metrics we call attribute-based metrics in which aggregates are grouped by hierarchical user attributes (e.g., their geographic location or software version). We demonstrate Mastic's practicality for these applications with a real-world example of each. We also compare our protocol with Prio and Poplar on a wide area network. Overall, we report over one order of magnitude performance improvement over Poplar for plain heavy-hitters and $1.5-2\\times$ improvement over Prio for attribute-based metrics.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the optimization of the number of logical qubits in quantum algorithms for factoring and computing discrete logarithms in $\\mathbb{Z}_N^*$. These algorithms contain an exponentiation circuit modulo $N$, which is responsible for most of their cost, both in qubits and operations.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we show that using only $o(\\log N)$ work qubits, one can obtain the least significant bits of the modular exponentiation output. We combine this result with May and Schlieper's truncation technique (ToSC 2022) and the Eker\u00e5-H\u00e5stad variant of Shor's algorithm (PQCrypto 2017) to solve the discrete logarithm problem in $\\mathbb{Z}_N^*$ using only $d + o(\\log N)$ qubits, where $d$ is the bit-size of the logarithm. Consequently we can factor $n$-bit RSA moduli using $n/2 + o(n)$ qubits, while current envisioned implementations require about $2n$ qubits.\r\n\r\nOur algorithm uses a Residue Number System and succeeds with a parametrizable probability. Being completely classical, we have implemented and tested it. For RSA factorization, we can reach a gate count $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ for a depth $\\mathcal{O}(n^2 \\log^3 n)$, which then has to be multiplied by $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ (the number of measurement results required by Eker\u00e5-H\u00e5stad). To factor an RSA-2048 instance, we estimate that 1730 logical qubits and $2^{36}$ Toffoli gates will suffice for a single run, and the algorithm needs on average 40 runs. To solve a discrete logarithm instance of 224 bits (112-bit classical security) in a safe-prime group of 2048 bits, we estimate that 684 logical qubits would suffice, and 20 runs with $2^{32}$ Toffoli gates each.",

    "abstract": "Cleve's celebrated result (STOC'86) showed that a strongly fair multi-party coin-toss is impossible in the presence of majority-sized coalitions. Recently, however, a fascinating line of work studied a relaxed fairness notion called \\emph{game-theoretic fairness}, which guarantees that no coalition should be incentivized to deviate from the prescribed protocol. \r\nA sequence of works has explored the feasibility of game-theoretic fairness for \\emph{two-sided} coin-toss, and indeed demonstrated feasibility in the dishonest majority setting under standard cryptographic assumptions. In fact, the recent work of Wu, Asharov, and Shi (EUROCRYPT'22) completely characterized the regime where game-theoretic fairness is feasible. However, this line of work is largely restricted to two-sided coin-toss, and more precisely on a \\emph{uniform} coin-toss (i.e., Bernoulli with parameter $1/2$). The only exceptions are the works on game-theoretically fair leader election, which can be viewed as a special case of uniform $n$-sided coin-toss where $n$ is the number of parties.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we \\emph{initiate} the comprehensive study of game-theoretic fairness for multi-party \\emph{sampling from general distributions}. In particular, for the case of $m$-sided \\emph{uniform} coin-toss we give a nearly complete characterization of the regime in which game-theoretic fairness is feasible. Interestingly, contrary to standard fairness notions in cryptography, the composition of game-theoretically fair two-sided coin-toss protocols does not necessarily yield game-theoretically fair multi-sided coins. To circumvent this, we introduce new techniques compatible with game-theoretic fairness.\r\nIn particular, we give the following results:\r\n\r\n- We give a protocol from standard cryptographic assumptions that achieves game-theoretic fairness for uniform $m$-sided coin-toss against half- or more-sized adversarial coalitions. \r\n    \r\n- To complement our protocol, we give a general impossibility result that establishes the optimality of our protocol for a broad range of parameters modulo an additive constant. Even in the worst-case, the gap between our protocol and our impossibility result is only a small constant multiplicative factor.\r\n\r\n- We also present a game-theoretically fair protocol for \\emph{any} efficiently sampleable $m$-outcome distribution in the dishonest majority setting. For instance, even for the case of $m=2$ (i.e., two-sided coin-toss), our result implies a game-theoretically fair protocol for an \\emph{arbitrary} Bernoulli coin. In contrast, the work of Wu, Asharov, and Shi only focussed on a Bernoulli coin with parameter $1/2$.",

    "abstract": "Universal computational extractors (UCEs), introduced by Bellare, Hoang, and Keelveedhi [BHK13], can securely replace random oracles in various applications, including KDM-secure encryption, deterministic encryption, RSA-OAEP, etc. Despite its usefulness, constructing UCE in the standard model is challenging. The only known positive result is given by Brzuska and Mittelbach [BM14], who construct UCE with strongly computationally unpredictable one-query source assuming indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) and the existence of point obfuscators with auxiliary input (AIPO); they also construct UCE with $q$-query sources assuming iO and composable AIPO. On the other hand, Brzuska, Farshim, and Mittelbach [BFM14] show that the most potent version of UCE does not exist, assuming the existence of iO.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we construct UCE with strongly computationally unpredictable one-query sources from lattice assumptions based on the GGH15 encodings [GGH15], without using iO. Security is proven under the following assumptions: (1) LWE with subexponential hardness; (2) evasive LWE, which is a new assumption proposed by Wee [Wee22]; (3) the existence of AIPO in NC1. Our UCE directly implies a universal hardcore function that outputs a polynomial number of bits, giving the first lattice-based universal hardcore function without using iO. We also put forth a new primitive called obliviously programmable function as an intermediate abstraction; it makes our analysis more modularized and could be of independent interest",

    "abstract": "Keyed homomorphic public key encryption (KHPKE) is a variant of homomorphic public key encryption, where only users who have a homomorphic evaluation key can perform a homomorphic evaluation. Then, KHPKE satisfies the CCA2 security against users who do not have a homomorphic evaluation key, while it satisfies the CCA1 security against users who have the key. Thus far, several KHPKE schemes have been proposed under the standard Diffie-Hellman-type assumptions and keyed fully homomorphic encryption (KFHE) schemes have also been proposed from lattices although there are no KFHE schemes secure solely under the LWE assumption in the standard model. As a natural extension, there is an identity-based variant of KHPKE; however, the security is based on a $q$-type assumption and there are no attribute-based variants. Moreover, there are no identity-based variants of KFHE schemes due to the complex design of the known KFHE schemes. In this paper, we provide two constructions of attribute-based variants. First, we propose an attribute-based KFHE (ABKFHE) scheme from lattices. We start by designing the first KFHE scheme secure solely under the LWE assumption in the standard model. Since the design is conceptually much simpler than known KFHE schemes, we replace their building blocks with attribute-based ones and obtain the proposed ABKFHE schemes. Next, we propose an efficient attribute-based KHPKE (ABKHE) scheme from a pair encoding scheme (PES). Due to the benefit of PES, we obtain various ABKHE schemes that contain the first identity-based KHPKE scheme secure under the standard $k$-linear assumption and the first pairing-based ABKHE schemes supporting more expressive predicates.",

    "abstract": "We study succinct non-interactive arguments (SNARGs) and succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (SNARKs) for the class $\\mathsf{UP}$ in the reusable designated verifier model. $\\mathsf{UP}$ is an expressive subclass of $\\mathsf{NP}$ consisting of all $\\mathsf{NP}$ languages where each instance has at most one witness; a designated verifier SNARG (dvSNARG) is one where verification of the SNARG proof requires a private verification key; and such a dvSNARG is reusable if soundness holds even against a malicious prover with oracle access to the (private) verification algorithm. \r\n   \r\nOur main results are as follows.\r\n\r\n(1) A reusably and adaptively sound zero-knowledge (zk) dvSNARG for $\\mathsf{UP}$, from subexponential LWE and evasive LWE (a relatively new but popular variant of LWE). Our SNARGs achieve very short proofs of length $(1 + o(1)) \\cdot \\lambda$ bits for $2^{-\\lambda}$ soundness error.\r\n\r\n(2) A generic transformation that lifts any ``Sahai-Waters-like'' (zk) SNARG to an adaptively sound (zk) SNARG, in the designated-verifier setting. In particular, this shows that the Sahai-Waters SNARG for $\\mathsf{NP}$ is adaptively sound in the designated verifier setting, assuming subexponential hardness of the underlying assumptions. The resulting SNARG proofs have length $(1 + o(1)) \\cdot \\lambda$ bits for $2^{-\\lambda}$ soundness error. Our result sidesteps the Gentry-Wichs barrier for adaptive soundness by employing an exponential-time security reduction.\r\n\r\n(3) A generic transformation, building on the work of Campanelli, Ganesh,  that lifts any adaptively sound (zk) SNARG for $\\mathsf{UP}$ to an adaptively sound (zk) SNARK for $\\mathsf{UP}$, while preserving zero-knowledge. The resulting SNARK achieves the strong notion of black-box extraction. There are barriers to achieving such SNARKs for all of $\\mathsf{NP}$ from falsifiable assumptions, so our restriction to $\\mathsf{UP}$ is, in a sense, necessary.\r\n\r\nApplying (3) to our SNARG for $\\mathsf{UP}$ from evasive LWE (1), we obtain a reusably and adaptively sound designated-verifier zero-knowledge SNARK for $\\mathsf{UP}$ from subexponential LWE and evasive LWE. Moreover, applying both (2) and (3) to the Sahai-Waters SNARG, we obtain the same result from LWE, subexponentially secure one-way functions, and subexponentially secure indistinguishability obfuscation. Both constructions have succinct proofs of size $\\mathsf{poly}(\\lambda)$. These are the first SNARK constructions (even in the designated-verifier setting) for a non-trivial subset of $\\mathsf{NP}$ from (sub-exponentially) falsifiable assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Thus far, several papers estimated concrete quantum resources of Shor\u2019s algorithm for solving a binary elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. In particular, the complexity of computing quantum inversions over a binary field F2n is dominant when running the algorithm, where n is a degree of a binary elliptic curve. There are two major methods for quantum inversion, i.e., the quantum GCD-based inversion and the quantum FLT-based inversion. Among them, the latter method is known to require more qubits; however, the latter one is valuable since it requires much fewer Toffoli gates and less depth. When n = 571, Kim-Hong\u2019s quantum GCD-based inversion algorithm (Quantum Information Processing 2023) and Taguchi-Takayasu\u2019s quantum FLT-based inversion algorithm (CT-RSA 2023) require 3, 473 qubits and 8, 566 qubits, respectively. In contrast, for the same n = 571, the latter algorithm requires only 2.3% of Toffoli gates and 84% of depth compared to the former one. In this paper, we modify Taguchi-Takayasu\u2019s quantum FLT-based inversion algorithm to reduce the required qubits. While Taguchi-Takayasu\u2019s FLT-based inversion algorithm takes an addition chain for n\u22121 as input and computes a sequence whose number is the same as the length of the chain, our proposed algorithm employs an uncomputation step and stores a shorter one. As a result, our proposed algorithm requires only 3, 998 qubits for n = 571, which is only 15% more than Kim-Hong\u2019s GCD-based inversion algorithm. Furthermore, our proposed algorithm preserves the advantage of FLT-based inversion since it requires only 3.7% of Toffoli gates and 77% of depth compared to Kim-Hong\u2019s GCD-based inversion algorithm for n = 571.",

    "abstract": "A zero-knowledge proof enables a prover to convince a verifier that $x \\in S$, without revealing anything beyond this fact. By running a zero-knowledge proof $k$ times, it is possible to prove (still in zero-knowledge) that $k$ separate instances $x_1,\\dots,x_k$ are all in $S$. However, this increases the communication by a factor of $k$. Can one do better? In other words, is (non-trivial) zero-knowledge batch verification for $S$ possible? \r\n\r\nRecent works by Kaslasi et al. (TCC 2020, Eurocrypt 2021) show that any problem possessing a non-interactive statistical zero-knowledge proof (NISZK) has a non-trivial statistical zero-knowledge batch verification protocol. Their results had two major limitations: (1) to batch verify $k$ inputs of size $n$ each, the communication in their batch protocol is roughly $\\textrm{poly}(n,\\log{k})+O(k)$, which is better than the naive cost of $k \\cdot \\textrm{poly}(n)$ but still scales linearly with $k$, and, (2) the batch protocol requires  $\\Omega(k)$ rounds of interaction.\r\n\r\nIn this work we remove both of these limitations by showing that any problem in $NISZK$ has a non-interactive statistical zero-knowledge batch verification protocol with communication $\\textrm{poly}(n,\\log{k})$.",

    "abstract": "Functional Encryption (FE) is a cutting-edge cryptographic technique that enables a user with a specific functional decryption key to determine a certain function of encrypted data without gaining access to the underlying data. Given its potential and the fact that FE is still a relatively new field, we set out to investigate how it could be applied to resource-constrained environments. This work presents what we believe to be the first lightweight FE scheme explicitly designed for resource-constrained devices. We also propose a use case protocol that demonstrates how our scheme can secure an Internet of Things (IoT) architecture where relevant devices collect data and securely deliver them to a storage server, where an analyst can request access to the encrypted data. Finally, we conduct thorough experiments on two commercially available resource-constrained devices to provide compelling evidence of our approach's practicality and efficiency. Although the results of our evaluations show that there is room for improvement in the proposed scheme, this work represents one of the first attempts to apply FE to the IoT setting that can directly impact people's daily lives and the everyday operations of organizations.",

    "abstract": "Nova is a new type of recursive proof system that uses a folding scheme as its core building block. This brilliant idea of folding relations can significantly reduce the recursion overhead. In this paper, we study some issues related to Nova\u2019s soundness proof, which relies on the soundness of the folding scheme in a recursive manner.\r\n\r\nFirst, due to its recursive nature, the proof strategy inevitably causes the running time of the recursive extractor to expand polynomially for each additional recursive step. This constrains Nova's soundness model to only logarithmically bounded recursive steps. Consequently, the soundness proof in this limited model does not guarantee soundness for a linear number of rounds in the security parameter, such as 128 rounds for 128-bit security. On the other hand, there are no known attacks on the arbitrary depth recursion of Nova, leaving a gap between theoretical security guarantees and real-world attacks. We aim to bridge this gap in two opposite directions. In the negative direction, we present a recursive proof system that is unforgeable in a log-round model but forgeable if used in linear rounds. This shows that the soundness proof in the log-round model might not be applicable to real-world applications that require linearly long rounds. In a positive direction, we show that when Nova uses a specific group-based folding scheme, its knowledge soundness over polynomial rounds can be proven in the algebraic group model with our modifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result to show Nova's polynomial rounds soundness.\r\n\r\nSecond, the folding scheme is converted non-interactively via the Fiat-Shamir transformation and then arithmetized into R1CS. Therefore, the soundness of Nova using the non-interactive folding scheme essentially relies on the heuristic random oracle instantiation in the standard model. In our new soundness proof for Nova in the algebraic group model, we replace this heuristic with a cryptographic hash function with a special property. We view this hash function as an independent object of interest and expect it to help further understand the soundness of Nova.",

    "abstract": "Cayley hash functions are based on a simple idea of using a pair of semigroup elements,  $A$ and  $B$, to hash the 0 and 1 bit, respectively, and  then to hash an arbitrary bit string in the natural way, by using multiplication of elements in the semigroup. The main advantage of Cayley hash functions compared to, say, hash functions in the SHA family is that when an already hashed document is amended, one does not have to hash the whole amended document all over again, but rather hash just the amended part and then multiply the result by the hash of the original document. Some authors argued that this may be a security hazard, specifically that this property may facilitate finding a second preimage by splitting a long bit string into shorter pieces. In this paper, we offer a way to get rid of this alleged disadvantage and keep the advantages at the same time. We call this method  ``Cayley hashing with cookies\" using terminology borrowed from the theory of random walks in a random environment. For the platform semigroup, we use $2\\times 2$ matrices over $F_p$.",

    "abstract": "In the past three decades, an impressive body of knowledge has been built around secure and private password authentication. In particular, secure password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocols require only minimal overhead over a classical Diffie-Hellman key exchange. PAKEs are also known to fulfill strong composable security guarantees that capture many password-specific concerns such as password correlations or password mistyping, to name only a few. However, to enjoy both round-optimality and strong security, applications of PAKE protocols must provide unique session and participant identifiers. If such identifiers are not readily available, they must be agreed upon at the cost of additional communication flows, a fact which has been met with incomprehension among practitioners, and which hindered the adoption of provably secure password authentication in practice.\r\n \r\nIn this work, we resolve this issue by proposing a new paradigm for truly password-only yet securely composable PAKE, called bare PAKE. We formally prove that two prominent PAKE protocols, namely CPace and EKE, can be cast as bare PAKEs and hence do not require pre-agreement of anything else than a password. Our bare PAKE modeling further allows us to investigate a novel \"reusability\" property of PAKEs, i.e., whether $n^2$ pairwise keys can be exchanged from only $n$ messages, just as the Diffie-Hellman non-interactive key exchange can do in a public-key setting. As a side contribution, this add-on property of bare PAKEs leads us to observe that some previous PAKE constructions relied on unnecessarily strong, \"reusable\" building blocks. By showing that ``non-reusable'' tools suffice for standard PAKE, we open a new path towards round-optimal post-quantum secure password-authenticated key exchange.",

Specifically, pseudorandomness is based on either $2^{O(\\sqrt{n})}$-hardness of LPN, or polynomial hardness of LPN and the planted XOR problem at low density. \r\n\r\nAs our primary application of pseudorandom codes, we present an undetectable watermarking scheme for outputs of language models that is robust to cropping and a constant rate of random substitutions and deletions. The watermark is undetectable in the sense that any number of samples of watermarked text are computationally indistinguishable from text output by the original model. This is the first undetectable watermarking scheme that can tolerate a constant rate of errors.\r\n\r\nOur second application is to steganography, where a secret message is hidden in innocent-looking content.

    "abstract": "We provide a novel view of public-key cryptography by showing full equivalences of certain primitives to \"hard\" monoid actions.  More precisely, we show that key exchange and two-party computation are exactly equivalent to monoid actions with certain structural and hardness properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first \"natural\" characterization of the mathematical structure inherent to any key exchange or two-party computation protocol, and the first explicit proof of the necessity of mathematical structure for public-key cryptography. We then utilize these characterizations to show new black-box separation results. Concretely, we obtain the following results:\r\n\r\n- Two-Party Key Exchange: We show that that any two-party noninteractive key exchange protocol is equivalent to the existence of an abelian monoid action equipped with a natural hardness property, namely (distributional) unpredictability. More generally, we show that any $k$-round (two-party) key exchange protocol is essentially equivalent to the existence of a (distributional) unpredictable monoid action with certain commutator-like properties. Rudich (Crypto '91) shows a black-box separation of $k$-round and $(k+1)$-round key exchange for any $k$; we use our generic primitive here to formalize this result and extend it to efficient key exchange protocols (where communication is poly($k$)). \r\n\r\n- Two-Party Computation: We show that any maliciously secure two-party computation protocol is also equivalent to a monoid action with commutator-like properties and certain hardness guarantees. We then use a generic version of this primitive to show a black-box separation between $k$-round semi-honest secure two-party computation and $(k+1)$-round maliciously secure two-party computation. This yields the first black-box separation (to our knowledge) between $k$-round and $(k+1)$-round maliciously secure two-party computation protocols.",

    "abstract": "Users bid in a transaction fee mechanism (TFM) to get their transactions included and confirmed by a blockchain protocol. Roughgarden (EC'21) initiated the formal treatment of TFMs and proposed three requirements: user incentive compatibility (UIC), miner incentive compatibility (MIC), and a form of collusion-resilience called OCA-proofness. Ethereum's EIP-1559 mechanism satisfies all three properties simultaneously when there is no contention between transactions, but loses the UIC property when there are too many eligible transactions to fit in a single block. Chung and Shi (SODA'23) considered an alternative notion of collusion-resilience, called c-side-constract-proofness (c-SCP), and showed that, when there is contention between transactions, no TFM can satisfy UIC, MIC, and c-SCP for any c at least 1. OCA-proofness asserts that the users and a miner should not be able to \"steal from the protocol\" and is intuitively weaker than the c-SCP condition, which stipulates that a coalition of a miner and a subset of users should not be able to profit through strategic deviations (whether at the expense of the protocol or of the users outside the coalition).\r\n\r\nOur main result is the first proof that, when there is contention between transactions, no (possibly randomized) direct-revelation TFM satisfies UIC, MIC, and OCA-proofness. This result resolves the main open question in Roughgarden(EC'21). We also suggest several relaxations of the basic model that allow our impossibility result to be circumvented.",

    "abstract": "CRYSTALS-Dilithium is a post-quantum secure digital signature algorithm currently being standardised by NIST. As a result, devices making use of CRYSTALS-Dilithium will soon become generally available and be deployed in various environments. It is thus important to assess the resistance of CRYSTALS-Dilithum implementations to physical attacks.\r\nIn this paper, we present an attack on a CRYSTALS-Dilithium implementation in hedged mode in ARM Cortex-M4 using fault injection. Voltage glitching is performed to skip computation of a seed during the generation of the signature. We identified settings that consistently skip the desired function without crashing the device. After the successful fault injection, the resulting signature allows for the extraction of the secret key vector. Our attack succeeds with probability 0.582 in a single trace.\r\nWe also propose countermeasures against the presented attack.",

    "abstract": "Threshold public key encryption (ThPKE) is PKE that can be decrypted by collecting \u201cpartial decryptions\u201d from t (\u2264 N) out of N parties. ThPKE based on the learning with errors problem (LWE) is particularly important because it can be extended to threshold fully homomorphic encryption (ThFHE). ThPKE and ThFHE are fundamental tools for constructing multiparty computation (MPC) protocols: In 2023, NIST initiated a project (NIST IR 8214C) to establish guidelines for implementing threshold cryptosystems. Because MPC often requires simulation-security (SS), ThPKE schemes that satisfy SS (SS-ThPKE) are also important. Recently, Micciancio and Suhl (ePrint 2023/1728) presented an efficient SS-ThPKE scheme based on LWE with a polynomial modulus. However, the scheme requires the use of a nonstandard problem called \u201cknown-norm LWE\u201d for the security proof because the norm \u2225e\u2225 of the error of the public key is leaked from the partial decryptions. This leads to the following two challenges: 1) The construction based on LWE relies on a nontight reduction from known- norm LWE to LWE. 2) No construction based on (standard) Ring-LWE has been presented. In this paper, we address both of these challenges: we propose an efficient SS-ThPKE scheme whose security is (directly) reduced from standard LWE/Ring-LWE with a polynomial modulus. The core technique of our construction is what we call \u201cerror sharing\u201d: We distribute shares of a small error \u03b6 via secret sharing, and use them to prevent leakage of \u2225e\u2225 from partial decryptions.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we study the communication complexity of perfectly secure MPC protocol with guaranteed output delivery against $t=(n-1)/3$ corruptions. The previously best-known result in this setting is due to Goyal, Liu, and Song (CRYPTO, 2019) which achieves $O(n)$ communication per gate, where $n$ is the number of parties. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the honest majority setting, a recent trend in designing efficient MPC protocol is to rely on packed Shamir sharings to speed up the online phase. In particular, the work by Escudero et al. (CCS 2022) gives the first semi-honest protocol that achieves a constant communication overhead per gate across all parties in the online phase while maintaining overall $O(n)$ communication per gate. We thus ask the following question: ``Is it possible to construct a perfectly secure MPC protocol with GOD such that the online communication per gate is $O(1)$ while maintaining overall $O(n)$ communication per gate?''\r\n\r\nIn this work, we give an affirmative answer by providing an MPC protocol for computing an arithmetic circuit $C$ over a finite field of size at least $2n$ with communication complexity $O(|C|+\\mathsf{Depth}\\cdot n+n^5 \\cdot \\log n)$ elements for the online phase, and $O(|C|\\cdot n+\\mathsf{Depth}\\cdot n^2 + n^5 \\cdot \\log n)$ elements for the preprocessing phase, where $|C|$ is the circuit size and $\\mathsf{Depth}$ is the circuit depth.",

    "abstract": "Secure multi-party computation (MPC) allows a set of $n$ parties to jointly compute a function over their private inputs. \r\nThe seminal works of Ben-Or, Canetti and Goldreich [STOC '93] and Ben-Or, Kelmer and Rabin [PODC '94] settled the feasibility of MPC over asynchronous networks. Despite the significant line of work devoted to improving the communication complexity, current protocols with information-theoretic security and optimal resilience $t<n/3$ communicate $\\Omega(n^4C)$ field elements for a circuit with $C$ multiplication gates. In contrast, synchronous MPC protocols with $O(nC)$ communication have long been known.\r\n\r\nIn this work we make progress towards closing this gap. We provide a novel MPC protocol in the asynchronous setting with statistical security that makes black-box use of an asynchronous complete secret-sharing (ACSS) protocol. The cost per multiplication reduces to the cost of distributing a constant number of sharings via ACSS, improving a linear factor over the state of the art by Choudhury and Patra [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory '17].\r\n\r\nWith a recent concurrent work achieving ACSS with linear cost per sharing, we achieve an MPC with ${O}(nC)$ communication and optimal resilience.",

    "abstract": "The Linear Code Equivalence (LCE) Problem has received increased attention in recent years due to its applicability in constructing efficient digital signatures. Notably, the LESS signature scheme based on LCE is under consideration for the NIST post-quantum standardization process, along with the MEDS signature scheme that relies on an extension of LCE to the rank metric, namely the Matrix Code Equivalence (MCE) Problem. Building upon these developments, a family of signatures with additional properties, including linkable ring, group, and threshold signatures, has been proposed. These novel constructions introduce relaxed versions of LCE (and MCE), wherein multiple samples share the same secret equivalence. Despite their significance, these variations have often lacked a thorough security analysis, being assumed to be as challenging as their original counterparts. Addressing this gap, our work delves into the sample complexity of LCE and MCE --- precisely, the sufficient number of samples required for efficient recovery of the shared secret equivalence. Our findings reveal, for instance, that one should not use the same secret twice in the LCE setting since this enables a polynomial time (and memory) algorithm to retrieve the secret. Consequently, our results unveil the insecurity of two advanced signatures based on variants of the LCE Problem.",

    "abstract": "Secure multiparty computation (MPC) allows a set of $n$ parties to jointly compute a function on their private inputs. In this work, we focus on the information-theoretic MPC in the \\emph{asynchronous network} setting with optimal resilience ($t<n/3$). The best-known result in this setting is achieved by Choudhury and Patra [J. Cryptol '23], which requires $O(n^4\\kappa)$ bits per multiplication gate, where $\\kappa$ is the size of a field element. \r\n    \r\n    An asynchronous complete secret sharing (ACSS) protocol allows a dealer to share a batch of Shamir sharings such that all parties eventually receive their shares. ACSS is an important building block in AMPC. The best-known result of ACSS is due to Choudhury and Patra [J. Cryptol '23], which requires $O(n^3\\kappa)$ bits per sharing. On the other hand, in the synchronous setting, it is known that distributing Shamir sharings can be achieved with $O(n\\kappa)$ bits per sharing. There is a gap of $n^2$ in the communication between the synchronous setting and the asynchronous setting.\r\n\r\n    Our work closes this gap by presenting the first ACSS protocol that achieves $O(n\\kappa)$ bits per sharing. When combined with the compiler from ACSS to AMPC by Choudhury and Patra [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory '17], we obtain an AMPC with $O(n^2\\kappa)$ bits per multiplication gate, improving the previously best-known result by a factor of $n^2$. Moreover, with a concurrent work that improves the compiler by Choudhury and Patra by a factor of $n$, we obtain the first AMPC with $O(n\\kappa)$ bits per multiplication gate.",

    "abstract": "We study blockchain-based provably anonymous payment systems between light clients. Such clients interact with the blockchain through full nodes, who can see what the light clients read and write. The goal of our work is to enable light clients to perform anonymous payments, while maintaining privacy even against the full nodes through which they interact with the blockchain.\r\n\r\nWe formalize the problem in the universal composability model and present a provably secure solution to it. In comparison to existing works, we are the first ones that simultaneously provide strong anonymity guarantees, provable security, and anonymity with respect to the full nodes. Along the way, we make several contributions that may be of independent interest.\r\n\r\nWe define and construct efficient compressible randomness beacons, which produce unpredictable values in regular intervals and allow for storing all published values in a short digest. We define and construct anonymous-coin friendly encryption schemes and we show how they can be used within anonymous payment systems. We define and construct strongly oblivious read-once map, which can be seen as a special data structure that needs to satisfy a stronger notion of obliviousness than what is usually considered. We present a new approach, which is compatible with light clients, for mitigating double-spending attacks in anonymous cryptocurrencies.",

    "abstract": "Fault injection attacks are a serious threat to system security, enabling attackers to bypass protection mechanisms or access sensitive information. To evaluate the robustness of CPU-based systems against these attacks, it is essential to analyze the consequences of the fault propagation resulting from the complex interplay between the software and the processor. However, current formal methodologies combining hardware and software face scalability issues due to the monolithic approach used.\r\nTo address this challenge, this work formalizes the $k$-fault resistant partitioning notion to solve the fault propagation problem when assessing redundancy-based hardware countermeasures in a first step. Proven security guarantees can then reduce the remaining hardware attack surface when introducing the software in a second step. First, we validate our approach against previous work by reproducing known results on cryptographic circuits. In particular, we outperform state-of-the-art tools for evaluating AES under a three-fault-injection attack. Then, we apply our methodology to the OpenTitan secure element and formally prove the security of its CPU's hardware countermeasure to single bit-flip injections. Besides that, we demonstrate that previously intractable problems, such as analyzing the robustness of OpenTitan running a secure boot process, can now be solved by a co-verification methodology that leverages a $k$-fault resistant partitioning. We also report a potential exploitation of the register file vulnerability in two other software use cases. Finally, we provide a security fix for the register file, prove its robustness, and integrate it into the OpenTitan project.",

    "abstract": "As blockchains like Ethereum continue to grow, clients with limited resources can no longer store the entire chain.\r\nLight nodes that want to use the blockchain, without verifying that it is in a good state overall, can just download the block headers without the corresponding block contents.\r\nAs those light nodes may eventually need some of the block contents, they would like to ensure that they are in principle available.\r\n\r\nData availability sampling, introduced by Bassam et al., is a process that allows light nodes to check the availability of data without download it.\r\nIn a recent effort, Hall-Andersen, Simkin, and Wagner have introduced formal definitions and analyzed several constructions.\r\nWhile their work thoroughly lays the formal foundations for data availability sampling, the constructions are either prohibitively expensive, use a trusted setup, or have a download complexity for light clients scales with a square root of the data size.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we make a significant step forward by proposing an efficient data availability sampling scheme without a trusted setup and only polylogarithmic overhead.\r\nTo this end, we find a novel connection with interactive oracle proofs of proximity (IOPPs).\r\nSpecifically, we prove that any IOPP meeting an additional consistency criterion can be turned into an erasure code commitment, and then, leveraging a compiler due to Hall-Andersen, Simkin, and Wagner, into a data availability sampling scheme.\r\nThis new connection enables data availability to benefit from future results on IOPPs.\r\nWe then show that the widely used FRI IOPP satisfies our consistency criterion and demonstrate that the resulting data availability sampling scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art asymptotically and concretely in multiple parameters.",

    "abstract": "Additive randomized encodings (ARE), introduced by Halevi, Ishai, Kushilevitz, and Rabin (CRYPTO 2023), reduce the computation of a k-party function $f (x_1, . . . , x_k )$ to locally computing encodings $\\hat{x}_i$ of each input xi and then adding them together over some Abelian group into an output encoding $\\hat{y} = \u2211 \\hat{x}_i$, which reveals nothing but the result. In robust ARE (RARE) the sum of any subset of $\\hat{x}_i$, reveals only the residual function obtained by restricting the corresponding inputs. The appeal of (R)ARE comes from the simplicity of the online part of the computation involving only addition, which yields for instance non-interactive multi-party computation in the shuffle model where messages from different parties are anonymously shuffled. Halevi, Ishai, Kushilevitz, and Rabin constructed ARE from standard assumptions and RARE in the ideal obfuscation model, leaving open the question of whether RARE can be constructed in the plain model.\r\nWe construct RARE in the plain model from indistinguishability obfuscation, which is necessary, and a new primitive that we call pseudo-non-linear codes. We provide two constructions of this primitive assuming either Learning with Errors or Decision Diffie Hellman. A bonus feature of our construction is that it is online succinct. Specifically, encodings $\\hat{x}_i$ can be decomposed to offline parts $\\hat{z}_i$ that can be sent directly to the evaluator and short online parts $\\hat{g}_i$ that are added together.",

    "abstract": "Gr\u00f6bner basis cryptanalysis of hash functions and ciphers, and their underlying permutations, has seen renewed interest recently. Anemoi (Crypto'23) is a permutation-based hash function that is arithmetization-friendly, i.e., efficient for a variety of arithmetizations used in zero-knowledge proofs. In this paper, exploring both theoretical bounds as well as experimental validation, we present new complexity estimates for Gr\u00f6bner basis attacks on the Anemoi permutation over prime fields.\r\nWe cast our findings in what we call the six worlds of Gr\u00f6bner basis cryptanalysis. As an example, keeping the same security arguments of the design, we conclude that at least $23 /45$ instead of $17 / 33$ rounds would need to be used for $128 / 256$-bit security before adding a security margin.",

Unfortunately, all existing CA protocols incur a communication complexity of at least $\\Omega(\\ell n^2)$. \r\nIn this work, we introduce the first CA protocol with the optimal communication of $\\mathcal{O}(\\ell  n)$ bits for inputs in $\\mathbb{Z}$ of size $\\ell = \\Omega(\\kappa \\cdot n^2 \\log n)$, where $\\kappa$ is the security parameter.",

    "abstract": "We revisit the construction of signature schemes using the MPC-in-the-head paradigm. We obtain two main contributions:\r\n\r\n\u2013 We observe that previous signatures in the MPC-in-the-head paradigm must rely on a salted version of the GGM puncturable pseudorandom function (PPRF) to avoid collision attacks. We design a new efficient PPRF construction that is provably secure in the multi-instance setting. The security analysis of our PPRF, in the ideal cipher model, is quite involved and forms a core technical contribution to our work. While previous constructions had to rely on a hash function, our construction uses only a fixed-key block cipher and is considerably more efficient as a result: we observe a 12\u00d7 to 55\u00d7 speed improvement for a recent signature scheme (Joux and Huth, Crypto\u201924). Our improved PPRF can be used to speed up many MPC-in-the-head signatures.\r\n\r\n\u2013 We introduce a new signature scheme from the regular syndrome decoding assumption, based on a new protocol for the MPC-in-the-head paradigm, which significantly reduces communication compared to previous works. Our scheme is conceptually simple, though its security analysis requires a delicate and nontrivial combinatorial analysis.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the need for a massively decentralized network concurrently servicing many clients, we present novel low-overhead UC-secure, publicly verifiable, threshold ECDSA protocols with identifiable abort.\r\nFor the first time, we show how to reduce the message complexity from O(n^2) to O(n) and the computational complexity from O(n) to practically O(1) (per party, where n is the number of parties).\r\nWe require only a broadcast channel for communication. Therefore, we natively support use-cases like permissionless bridges and decentralized custody, where P2P channels between every pair of parties are infeasible. Consequently, the message complexity is reduced and the protocol is publicly verifiable.\r\nWe enable all communication to be public (over a broadcast channel), by using a threshold additively homomorphic encryption scheme and novel zero-knowledge proofs.\r\nTo further reduce the computation and communication overheads, our protocols employ novel batching and amortization techniques, which may be of independent interest.\r\n\r\nOur second main contribution is the introduction of the notion of a 2PC-MPC protocol - a two-party ECDSA protocol where the second party is fully emulated by a network of n parties.\r\nThis notion assures that both the first party (the client) and (a threshold) of the network are required to participate in signing, while abstracting away the internal structure of the network.\r\nIn particular, the communication and computation complexities of the client remain independent of the network properties (e.g. size). This allows ultimate decentralization in distributed custody use-cases, as recent growing interest in the industry demands.\r\n\r\nWe report that our implementation completes the signing phase in 1.23 and 12.703 seconds, for 256 and 1024 parties, respectively.",

    "abstract": "We construct an adaptively sound SNARGs in the plain model with CRS\r\nrelying on the assumptions of (subexponential) indistinguishability obfuscation (iO), subexponential one-way functions and a notion of lossy functions we call length parameterized lossy functions. Length parameterized lossy functions take in separate security and input length parameters and have the property that the function image size in lossy mode depends only on the security parameter. We then show a novel way of constructing such functions from the Learning with Errors (LWE) assumption.\r\n\r\nOur work provides an alternative path towards achieving adaptively secure SNARGs from the recent work of Waters and Wu. Their work required the use of (essentially) perfectly re-randomizable one way functions (in addition to obfuscation).

    "abstract": "In 1994, Langford and Hellman introduced differential-linear (DL) cryptanalysis, with the idea of decomposing the block cipher E into two parts, EU and EL, such that EU exhibits a high-probability differential trail, while EL has a high-correlation linear trail.Combining these trails forms a distinguisher for E, assuming independence between EU and EL. The dependency between the two parts of DL distinguishers remained unaddressed until EUROCRYPT 2019, where Bar-On et al. introduced the DLCT framework, resolving the issue up to one S-box layer. However, extending the DLCT framework to formalize the dependency between the two parts for multiple rounds remained an open problem.\r\nIn this paper, we first tackle this problem from the perspective of boomerang analysis. By examining the relationships between DLCT, DDT, and LAT, we introduce a set of new tables facilitating the formulation of dependencies between the two parts of the DL distinguisher across multiple rounds. Then, we introduce a highly versatile and easy-to-use automatic tool for exploring DL distinguishers, inspired by automatic tools for boomerang distinguishers. This tool considers the dependency between differential and linear trails across multiple rounds. We apply our tool to various symmetric primitives, and in all applications, we either present the first DL distinguishers or enhance the best-known ones. We achieve successful results against Ascon, AES, SERPENT, PRESENT, SKINNY, TWINE, CLEFIA, WARP, LBlock, Simeck, and KNOT. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in some cases, DL distinguishers outperform boomerang distinguishers significantly.",

    "abstract": "We study how to construct hash functions that can securely instantiate the Fiat-Shamir transformation against bounded-depth adversaries. The motivation is twofold. First, given the recent fruitful line of research of constructing cryptographic primitives against bounded-depth adversaries under worst-case complexity assumptions, and the rich applications of Fiat-Shamir, instantiating Fiat-Shamir hash functions against bounded-depth adversaries under worst-case complexity assumptions might lead to further applications (such as SNARG for P, showing the cryptographic hardness of PPAD, etc.) against bounded-depth adversaries. Second, we wonder whether it is possible to overcome the impossibility results of constructing Fiat-Shamir for arguments [Goldwasser, Kalai, FOCS \u201903] in the setting where the depth of the adversary is bounded, given that the known impossibility results (against p.p.t. adversaries) are contrived.\r\n\r\nOur main results give new insights for Fiat-Shamir against bounded-depth adversaries in both the positive and negative directions. On the positive side, for Fiat-Shamir for proofs with certain properties, we show that weak worst-case assumptions are enough for constructing explicit hash functions that give $\\mathsf{AC}^0[2]$-soundness. In particular, we construct an $\\mathsf{AC}^0[2]$-computable correlation-intractable hash family for constant-degree polynomials against $\\mathsf{AC}^0[2]$ adversaries, assuming $\\oplus \\mathsf{L}/\\mathsf{poly} \\not\\subseteq \\widetilde{\\mathsf{Sum}}_{n^{-c}} \\circ\\mathsf{AC}^0[2]$ for some $c > 0$. This is incomparable to all currently-known constructions, which are typically useful for larger classes and against stronger adversaries, but based on arguably stronger assumptions. Our construction is inspired by the Fiat-Shamir hash function by Peikert and Shiehian [CRYPTO \u201919] and the fully-homomorphic encryption scheme against bounded-depth adversaries by Wang and Pan [EUROCRYPT \u201922].\r\n\r\nOn the negative side, we show Fiat-Shamir for arguments is still impossible to achieve against bounded-depth adversaries. In particular, \r\n\u2022 Assuming the existence of $\\mathsf{AC}^0[2]$-computable CRHF against p.p.t. adversaries, for every poly-size hash function, there is a (p.p.t.-sound) interactive argument that is not $\\mathsf{AC}^0[2]$-sound after applying Fiat-Shamir with this hash function.\r\n\u2022 Assuming the existence of $\\mathsf{AC}^0[2]$-computable CRHF against $\\mathsf{AC}^0[2]$ adversaries, there is an $\\mathsf{AC}^0[2]$-sound interactive argument such that for every hash function computable by $\\mathsf{AC}^0[2]$ circuits the argument does not preserve $\\mathsf{AC}^0[2]$-soundness when applying Fiat-Shamir with this hash function. This is a low-depth variant of the result of Goldwasser and Kalai.",

    "abstract": "Folding is a recent technique for building efficient recursive SNARKs. Several elegant folding protocols have been proposed, such as Nova, Supernova, Hypernova, Protostar, and others. However, all of them rely on an additively homomorphic commitment scheme based on discrete log, and are therefore not post-quantum secure and require a large (256-bit) field. In this work we present LatticeFold, the first lattice-based folding protocol based on the Module SIS problem. This folding protocol naturally leads to an efficient recursive lattice-based SNARK and an efficient PCD scheme. LatticeFold supports folding low-degree relations, such as R1CS, as well as high-degree relations, such as CCS. The key challenge is to construct a secure folding protocol that works with the Ajtai commitment scheme. The difficulty is ensuring that extracted witnesses are low norm through many rounds of folding. We present a novel technique using the sumcheck protocol to ensure that extracted witnesses are always low norm no matter how many rounds of folding are used. Since LatticeFold can operate over a small (64-bit) field, our evaluation of the final proof system suggests that it is as performant as Hypernova, while providing plausible post-quantum security. Moreover, LatticeFold operates over the same module structure used by fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and lattice signatures schemes, and can therefore benefit from software optimizations and custom hardware designed to accelerate these lattice schemes.",

    "abstract": "Decentralized Storage Networks (DSNs) represent a paradigm shift in data storage methodology, distributing and housing data across multiple network nodes rather than relying on a centralized server or data center architecture. The fundamental objective of DSNs is to enhance security, reinforce reliability, and mitigate censorship risks by eliminating a single point of failure. Leveraging blockchain technology for functions such as access control, ownership validation, and transaction facilitation, DSN initiatives aim to provide users with a robust and secure alternative to traditional centralized storage solutions. This paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of the developmental trajectory of DSNs, focusing on key components such as Proof of Storage protocols, consensus algorithms, and incentive mechanisms. Additionally, the study explores recent optimization tactics, encountered challenges, and potential avenues for future research, thereby offering insights into the ongoing evolution and advancement within the DSN domain.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, decentralized computing has gained popularity in various domains such as decentralized learning, financial services and the Industrial Internet of Things. As identity privacy becomes increasingly important in the era of big data, safeguarding user identity privacy while ensuring the security of decentralized computing systems has become a critical challenge. To address this issue, we propose ADC (Anonymous Decentralized Computing) to achieve anonymity in decentralized computing. In ADC, the entire network of users can vote to trace and revoke malicious nodes. Furthermore, ADC possesses excellent Sybil-resistance and Byzantine fault tolerance, enhancing the security of the system and increasing user trust in the decentralized computing system. To decentralize the system, we propose a practical blockchain-based decentralized group signature scheme called Group Contract. We construct the entire decentralized system based on Group Contract, which does not require the participation of a trusted authority to guarantee the above functions. Finally, we conduct rigorous privacy and security analysis and performance evaluation to demonstrate the security and practicality of ADC for decentralized computing with only a minor additional time overhead.",

    "abstract": "Given its integral role in modern encryption systems such as CRYSTALS-Kyber, the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform will soon be at the center of our secure communications infrastructure. An enduring debate surrounding the FO transform is whether to use explicit or implicit rejection when decapsulation fails. Presently, implicit rejection, as implemented in CRYSTALS-Kyber, is supported by a strong set of arguments. Therefore, understanding its security implications in different attacker models is essential.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we study implicit rejection through a novel lens, namely, from the perspective of kleptography. Concretely, we consider an attacker model in which the attacker can subvert the user's code to compromise security while remaining undetectable. In this scenario, we present three attacks that significantly reduce the security level of the FO transform with implicit rejection. Notably, our attacks apply to CRYSTALS-Kyber.",

    "abstract": "Eligibility checks are often abstracted away or omitted in voting protocols, leading to situations where the voting server can easily stuff the ballot box. One reason for this is the difficulty of bootstraping the authentication material for voters without relying on trusting the voting server.\r\nIn this paper, we propose a new protocol that solves this problem by building on OpenID, a widely deployed authentication protocol. Instead of using it as a standard authentication means, we turn it into a mechanism that delivers transferable proofs of eligibility. Using zk-SNARK proofs, we show that this can be done without revealing any compromising information, in particular, protecting everlasting privacy. Our approach remains efficient and can easily be integrated into existing protocols, as we have done for the Belenios voting protocol. We provide a full-fledged proof of concept along with benchmarks showing our protocol could be realistically used in large-scale elections.",

    "abstract": "We build a concretely efficient threshold encryption scheme where the joint public key of a set of parties is computed as a deterministic function of their locally computed public keys, enabling a silent setup phase. By eliminating interaction from the setup phase, our scheme immediately enjoys several highly desirable features such as asynchronous setup, multiverse support, and dynamic threshold.\r\n    Prior to our work, the only known constructions of threshold encryption with silent setup relied on heavy cryptographic machinery such as indistinguishability Obfuscation or witness encryption for all of $\\mathsf{NP}$. Our core technical innovation lies in building a special purpose witness encryption scheme for the statement ``at least $t$ parties have signed a given message''. Our construction relies on pairings and is proved secure in the Generic Group Model. \r\n    Notably, our construction, restricted to the special case of threshold $t=1$, gives an alternative construction of the (flexible) distributed broadcast encryption from pairings, which has been the central focus of several recent works.\r\n    We implement and evaluate our scheme to demonstrate its concrete efficiency. Both encryption and partial decryption are constant time, taking $<7\\,$ms and $<1\\,$ms, respectively. For a committee of $1024$ parties, the aggregation of partial decryptions takes $<200\\,$ms, when all parties provide partial decryptions. The size of each ciphertext is $\\approx 8\\times$ larger than an ElGamal ciphertext.",

    "abstract": "Recent constructions of private information retrieval (PIR) have seen significant improvements in computational performance. However, these improvements rely on heavy offline preprocessing that is typically difficult in real-world applications. Motivated by the question of PIR with no offline processing, we introduce WhisPIR, a fully stateless PIR protocol with low per-query communication. WhisPIR clients are all ephemeral, meaning that they appear with only the protocol public parameters and disappear as soon as their query is complete, giving no opportunity for additional \"offline\" communication that is not counted towards the overall query communication. As such, WhisPIR is highly suited for practical applications that must support many clients and frequent database updates. \r\n\r\nWe demonstrate that WhisPIR requires significantly less communication than all other lattice-based PIR protocols in a stateless setting. WhisPIR is outperformed in computation only by SimplePIR and HintlessPIR when the database entries are large (several kilobytes). WhisPIR achieves this performance by introducing a number of novel optimizations. These include improvements to the index expansion algorithm of SealPIR & OnionPIR that optimizes the algorithm when only one rotation key is available. WhisPIR also makes novel use of the non-compact variant of the BGV homomorphic encryption scheme to further save communication and computation. To demonstrate the practicality of WhisPIR, we apply the protocol to the problem of secure blocklist checking, an important user-safety application in end-to-end encrypted messaging.",

    "abstract": "Interactive theorem provers (ITPs), such as Lean and Coq, can express\r\nformal proofs for a large category of theorems, from abstract math to\r\nsoftware correctness. Consider Alice who has a Lean proof for some\r\npublic statement\u00a0$T$. Alice wants to convince the world that she has\r\nsuch a proof, without revealing the actual proof. Perhaps the proof\r\nshows that a secret program is correct or safe, but the proof itself\r\nmight leak information about the program's source code. A natural way\r\nfor Alice to proceed is to construct a succinct, zero-knowledge,\r\nnon-interactive argument of knowledge (zkSNARK) to prove that she has a\r\nLean proof for the statement\u00a0$T$.\r\n\r\nIn this work we build zkPi, the first zkSNARKfor proofs expressed in\r\nLean, a state of the art interactive theorem prover. With zkPi, a prover\r\ncan convince a verifier that a Lean theorem is true, while revealing\r\nlittle else. The core problem is building an efficient zkSNARKfor\r\ndependent typing. We evaluate zkPion theorems from two core Lean\r\nlibraries: stdlib and mathlib. zkPisuccessfuly proves 57.9% of the\r\ntheorems in stdlib, and 14.1% of the theorems in mathlib, within 4.5\r\nminutes per theorem. A zkPiproof is sufficiently short that Fermat could\r\nhave written one in the margin of his notebook to convince the world, in\r\nzero knowledge, that he proved his famous last theorem.\r\n\r\nInteractive theorem provers (ITPs) can express virtually all systems of\r\nformal reasoning. Thus, an implemented zkSNARKfor ITP theorems\r\ngeneralizes practical zero-knowledge's interface beyond the status quo:\r\ncircuit satisfiability and program execution.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the limitations of the generic approaches to solving cryptographic problems in classical and quantum settings in various models. \r\n- In the classical generic group model (GGM), we find simple alternative proofs for the lower bounds of variants of the discrete logarithm (DL) problem: the multiple-instance DL and one-more DL problems (and their mixture). We also re-prove the unknown-order GGM lower bounds, such as the order finding, root extraction, and repeated squaring.\r\n- In the quantum generic group model (QGGM), we study the complexity of variants of the discrete logarithm. We prove the logarithm DL lower bound in the QGGM even for the composite order setting. We also prove an asymptotically tight lower bound for the multiple-instance DL problem. Both results resolve the open problems suggested in a recent work by Hhan, Yamakawa, and Yun.\r\n- In the quantum generic ring model we newly suggested, we give the logarithmic lower bound for the order-finding algorithms, an important step for Shor's algorithm. We also give a logarithmic lower bound for a certain generic factoring algorithm outputting relatively small integers, which includes a modified version of Regev's algorithm.\r\n- Finally, we prove a lower bound for the basic index calculus method for solving the DL problem in a new idealized group model regarding smooth numbers.\r\nThe quantum lower bounds in both models allow certain (different) types of classical preprocessing.\r\nAll of the proofs are significantly simpler than the previous proofs and are through a single tool, the so-called compression lemma, along with linear algebra tools. Our use of this lemma may be of independent interest.",

Recently, Sungjin Yu et al. proposed a PUF-based, robust, and anonymous authentication and key establishment scheme for V2G networks.

    "abstract": "We introduce YPIR, a single-server private information retrieval (PIR) protocol that achieves high throughput (up to 83% of the memory bandwidth of the machine) without any offline communication. For retrieving a 1-bit (or 1-byte) record from a 32 GB database, YPIR achieves 12.1 GB/s/core server throughput and requires 2.5 MB of total communication. On the same setup, the state-of-the-art SimplePIR protocol achieves a 12.5 GB/s/core server throughput, requires 1.5 MB total communication, but additionally requires downloading a 724 MB hint in an offline phase. YPIR leverages a new lightweight technique to remove the hint from high-throughput single-server PIR schemes with small overhead. We also show how to reduce the server preprocessing time in the SimplePIR family of protocols by a factor of $10$-$15\\times$.\r\n\r\nBy removing the need for offline communication, YPIR significantly reduces the server-side costs for private auditing of Certificate Transparency logs. Compared to the best previous PIR-based approach, YPIR reduces the server-side costs by a factor of $8\\times$. Note that to reduce communication costs, the previous approach assumed that updates to the Certificate Transparency log servers occurred in weekly batches. Since there is no offline communication in YPIR, our approach allows clients to always audit the most recent Certificate Transparency logs (e.g., updating once a day). Supporting daily updates using the prior scheme would cost $48\\times$ more than YPIR (based on current AWS compute costs).",

    "abstract": "The advent of Web3 technologies promises unprecedented levels of user control and autonomy. However, this decentralization shifts the burden of security onto the users, making it crucial to understand their security behaviors and perceptions. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive framework that identifies four core components of user interaction within the Web3 ecosystem: blockchain infrastructures, Web3-based Decentralized Applications (DApps), online communities, and off-chain cryptocurrency platforms. We delve into the security concerns perceived by users in each of these components and analyze the mitigation strategies they employ, ranging from risk assessment and aversion to diversification and acceptance. We further discuss the landscape of both technical and human-induced security risks in the Web3 ecosystem, identify the unique security differences between Web2 and Web3, and highlight key challenges that render users vulnerable, to provide implications for security design in Web3.",

    "abstract": "Two-party computation has been an active area of research since Yao's breakthrough results on garbled circuits. We present secret key additive somewhat homomorphic schemes where the client has perfect privacy (server can be computationally unbounded). Our basic scheme is additive somewhat homomorphic and we give protocols to handle addition and multiplication. In one scheme, the server handles circuit multiplication gates by returning the multiplicands to the client which does the multiplication and sends back the encrypted product. We give a 2-party protocol that \r\nalso incorporates server inputs where the client has perfect privacy. Server privacy is not information-theoretic, but rather depends on hardness of the subset sum problem.\r\nCorrectness for the server in the malicious model can be verified by a 3rd party with high probability where the client and server privacy are information-theoretically protected from the verifier. Scaling the 2PC protocol via separate encryption parameters for smaller subcircuits allows the ciphertext size to remain constant as circuit size grows.",

    "abstract": "We present a new method for efficient look-up table (LUT) evaluation in homomorphic encryption (HE), based on Ring-LWE-based HE schemes, including both integer-message schemes such as Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV) and Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren (BFV), and complex-number-message schemes like the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme. Our approach encodes bit streams into codewords and translates LUTs into low-degree multivariate polynomials, allowing for the simultaneous evaluation of multiple independent LUTs with minimal overhead. To mitigate noise accumulation in the CKKS scheme, we propose a novel noise-reduction technique, accompanied by proof demonstrating its effectiveness in asymptotically decreasing noise levels.\r\nWe demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness through a proof-of-concept implementation, showcasing significant efficiency gains, including a 0.029ms per slot evaluation for 8-input, 8-output LUTs and a 280ms amortized decryption time for AES-128 using CKKS on a single GPU. This work not only advances LUT evaluation in HE but also introduces a transciphering method for the CKKS scheme utilizing standard symmetric-key encryption, bridging the gap between discrete bit strings and numerical data.",

    "abstract": "Multi-user (mu) security considers large-scale attackers that, given access to a number of cryptosystem instances, attempt to compromise at least one of them. We initiate the study of mu security of the so-called GGMtree that stems from the PRG-to-PRF transformation of Goldreich, Goldwasser, and Micali, with a goal to provide references for its recently popularized use in applied cryptography. We propose a generalized model for GGM trees and analyze its mu prefix-constrained PRF security in the random oracle model. Our model allows to derive concrete bounds and improvements for various protocols, and we showcase on the Bitcoin-Improvement-Proposal standard Bip32 hierarchical wallets and function secret sharing (FSS) protocols. In both scenarios, we propose improvements with better performance and concrete security bounds at the same time. Compared with the state-of-the-art designs, our SHACAL3- and KeccaK-\ud835\udc5d-based Bip32 variants reduce the communication cost of MPC-based implementations by 73.3%\u223c93.8%, while our AES-based FSS substantially improves mu security while reducing computations by 50%.",

    "abstract": "The Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem and its specific form, LPN with regularity, are widely utilized in crafting cryptographic primitives. Recently, extending these problems to operate over larger fields has been considered to enhance applications. Despite the broad analysis available for traditional LPN approaches, the exploration of LPN over large fields remains underdeveloped. This gap in research has led to the development of improved attacks, suggesting that primitives based on LPN over large fields may not meet necessary security standards.\r\n\r\nWe have developed an algorithm that enhances the efficiency of solving the LPN over large fields. This method innovatively modifies the Gaussian elimination attack, traditionally known as Prange's information set decoding algorithm. Our key advancement involves the selective use of partial Gaussian elimination rather than employing the full Gaussian algorithm throughout, which we have termed the ``Reduce and Prange's (RP) algorithm.\" Additionally, we apply the RP algorithm to address the LPN problem over large fields with regular noise. Our RP highlights two key aspects: the vulnerability of existing schemes and the superiority of our approach compared to recent analyses.\r\n\r\nOur findings reveal that cryptographic applications, including Syndrome Decoding in the Head frameworks (Crypto'22, Asiacrypt'23, Eurocrypt'24) and Scalable Multiparty Garbling (CCS'23), are not secure enough. To be precise, the schemes fail to achieve their intended bit-security. \r\n\r\nCompared to the previous analysis by Liu et al. (Eurocrypt'24), we show that for LPN over large fields (e.g., 128-bit field size), the bit-security is reduced by 5-11 bits .\r\nFurthermore, our RP algorithm for solving LPN with regular noise outperforms recent results by Liu et al., Briaud, and \u00d8ygard (Eurocrypt'23) under certain parameter choices, leading to a reduction in bit-security by 5-20 bits for LPN with regular noise.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate cryptography is one of the main candidates for\r\ncreating post-quantum public key cryptosystems.

The signature schemes UOV and Rainbow are two of the most promising and best studied multivariate schemes which have proven secure\r\nfor more than a decade. However, so far the security of multivariate signature schemes towards physical attacks has not been appropriately assessed. Towards a better understanding of the physical security of multivariate\r\nsignature schemes, this paper presents fault attacks against SingleField schemes, especially UOV and Rainbow.

    "abstract": "Traditional STARKs require a cyclic group of a smooth order in the field. This allows efficient interpolation of points using the FFT algorithm, and writing constraints that involve neighboring rows. The Elliptic Curve FFT (ECFFT, Part I and II) introduced a way to make efficient STARKs for any finite field, by using a cyclic group of an elliptic curve. We show a simpler construction in the lines of ECFFT over the circle curve $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. When $p + 1$ is divisible by a large power of $2$, this construction is as efficient as traditional STARKs and ECFFT.  Applied to the Mersenne prime $p = 2^{31} \u2212 1$, which has been recently advertised in the IACR eprint 2023:824, our preliminary benchmarks indicate a speed-up by a factor of $1.4$ compared to a traditional STARK using the Babybear prime $p = 2^{31} \u2212 2^{27} + 1$.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present an efficient attack against ${\\tt PROV}$, a recent variant of the popular Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar (${\\tt UOV}$) multivariate signature scheme, that has been submitted to the ongoing ${\\tt NIST}$ standardization process for additional post-quantum signature schemes. A notable feature of ${\\tt PROV}$ is its proof of security, namely, existential unforgeability under a chosen-message attack (${\\tt EUF-CMA}$), assuming the hardness of solving the system formed by the public-key non-linear equations. \r\nWe present a polynomial-time key-recovery attack against the first specification of ${\\tt PROV}$ (v$1.0$). To do so, we remark that a small fraction of the ${\\tt PROV}$ secret-key is leaked during the signature process. Adapting and extending previous works on basic ${\\tt UOV}$, we show that the entire secret-key can be then recovered from such a small fraction in polynomial-time. This leads to an efficient attack against ${\\tt PROV}$ that we validated in practice. For all the security parameters suggested in by the authors of ${\\tt PROV}$, our attack recovers the secret-key in at most $8$ seconds.  We conclude the paper by discussing the apparent mismatch between such a practical attack and the theoretical security claimed by ${\\tt PROV}$ designers.  Our attack is not structural but exploits that the current specification of ${\\tt PROV}$ differs from the required security model. \r\nA simple countermeasure makes ${\\tt PROV}$ immune against the attack presented here and led the designers to update the specification of  ${\\tt PROV}$ (v$1.1$).",

    "abstract": "Threshold variants of the Schnorr signature scheme have recently been at the center of attention due to their applications to cryptocurrencies. However, existing constructions for threshold Schnorr signatures among a set of $n$ parties with corruption threshold $t_c$ suffer from at least one of the following drawbacks: (i) security only against static (i.e., non-adaptive) adversaries, (ii) cubic or higher communication cost to generate a single signature, (iii) strong synchrony assumptions on the network, or (iv) $t_c+1$ are sufficient to generate a signature, i.e., the corruption threshold of the scheme equals its reconstruction threshold. Especially (iv) turns out to be a severe limitation for many asynchronous real-world applications where $t_c < n/3$ is necessary to maintain liveness, but a higher signing threshold of $n-t_c$ is needed. A recent scheme, ROAST, proposed by Ruffing et al. (ACM CCS 2022) addresses (iii) and (iv), but still falls short of obtaining subcubic communication complexity and adaptive security.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we present HARTS, the first threshold Schnorr signature scheme to incorporate all these desiderata. More concretely: \r\n\r\n- HARTS is adaptively secure and remains fully secure and operational even under asynchronous network conditions in the presence of up to $t_c < n/3$ malicious parties. This is optimal. \r\n\r\n- HARTS outputs a Schnorr signature of size $\\lambda$ with a near-optimal amortized communication cost of $O(\\lambda n^2 \\log{n})$ bits and a single asynchronous online round per signature.\r\n\r\n- HARTS is high-threshold: no fewer than $t_r+1$ signature shares can be combined to yield a full signature, where any $t_r\\in [t_c,n-t_c)$ is supported. This especially covers the case $t_r \\geq 2n/3 > 2t_c$. This is optimal. \r\n\r\nWe prove our result in a modular fashion in the algebraic group model. At the core of our construction, we design a new simple and adaptively secure high-threshold asynchronous verifiable secret sharing (AVSS) scheme which may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Polynomial commitment scheme allows a prover to commit to a polynomial $f \\in \\mathcal{R}[X]$ of degree $L$, and later prove that the committed function was correctly evaluated at a specified point $x$; in other words $f(x)=u$ for public $x,u \\in\\mathcal{R}$. Most applications of polynomial commitments, e.g. succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (SNARKs), require that (i) both the commitment and evaluation proof are succinct (i.e., polylogarithmic in the degree $L$) - with the latter being efficiently verifiable, and (ii) no pre-processing step is allowed. \r\n\r\n Surprisingly, as far as plausibly quantum-safe polynomial commitments are concerned, the currently most efficient constructions only rely on weak cryptographic assumptions, such as security of hash functions. Indeed, despite making use of the underlying algebraic structure, prior lattice-based polynomial commitments still seem to be much behind the hash-based ones. Moreover, security of the aforementioned lattice constructions against quantum adversaries was never formally discussed.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we bridge the gap and propose the first (asymptotically and concretely) efficient lattice-based polynomial commitment with transparent setup and post-quantum security. Our interactive variant relies on the standard (Module-)SIS problem, and can be made non-interactive in the random oracle model using Fiat-Shamir transformation. In addition, we equip the scheme with a knowledge soundness proof against quantum adversaries which can be of independent interest. In terms of concrete efficiency, for $L=2^{20}$ our scheme yields proofs of size $2$X smaller than the hash-based \\textsf{FRI} commitment (Block et al., Asiacrypt 2023), and $70$X smaller than the very recent lattice-based construction by Albrecht et al. (Eurocrypt 2024).",

    "abstract": "Since its introduction by Wagner (CRYPTO `02), the $k$-list algorithm has found significant utility in cryptanalysis. One important application thereof is in computing forgeries on several interactive signature schemes that implicitly rely on the hardness of the ROS problem formulated by Schnorr (ICICS `01). The current best attack strategy for these schemes relies the conjectured runtime of the $k$-list algorithm over $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. The tightest known analysis of Wagner's algorithm over $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ is due to Shallue (ANTS `08). However, it hides large polynomial factors and leaves a gap with respect to desirable concrete parameters for the attack. In this work, we develop a degraded version of the $k$-list algorithm which provably enforces the heuristic invariants in Wagner's original. In the process, we devise and analyze a new list merge procedure that we dub the interval merge. We give a thorough analysis of the runtime and success probability of our degraded algorithm, and show that it beats the projected runtime of the analysis by Shallue for parameters relevant to the generalized ROS attack of Benhamouda et al. (EUROCRYPT `21). For a $256$-bit prime $p$, and $k = 8$, our degraded $k$-list algorithm runs in time $\\approx 2^{70.4}$, while Shallue's analysis states that the Wagner's original algorithm runs in time $\\approx 2^{98.3}$.",

    "abstract": "A recent work by Ball, Li, Lin, and Liu [Eurocrypt'23] presented a new instantiation of the arithmetic garbling paradigm introduced by Applebaum, Ishai, and Kushilevitz [FOCS'11]. In particular, Ball et al.'s garbling scheme is the first constant-rate garbled circuit over large enough bounded integer computations, inferring the first constant-round constant-rate secure two-party computation (2PC) over bounded integer computations in the presence of semi-honest adversaries.\r\n\r\nThe main source of difficulty in lifting the security of garbling schemes-based protocols to the malicious setting lies in proving the correctness of the underlying garbling scheme. In this work, we analyze the security of Ball et al.'s scheme in the presence of malicious attacks. \r\n\r\n- We demonstrate an overflow attack, which is inevitable in this computational model, even if the garbled circuit is fully correct. Our attack follows by defining an adversary, corrupting either the garbler or the evaluator, that chooses a bad input and causes the computation to overflow, thus leaking information about the honest party's input. By utilizing overflow attacks, we show that $1$-bit leakage is necessary for achieving security against a malicious garbler, discarding the possibility of achieving full malicious security in this model. We further demonstrate a wider range of overflow attacks against a malicious evaluator with more than $1$ bit of leakage.\r\n\r\n- We boost the security level of Ball et al.'s scheme by utilizing two variants of Vector Oblivious Linear Evaluation, denoted by VOLEc and aVOLE. We present the first constant-round constant-rate 2PC protocol over bounded integer computations, in the presence of a malicious garbler with $1$-bit leakage and a semi-honest evaluator, in the {VOLEc,aVOLE}-hybrid model and being black-box in the underlying group and ring.  Compared to the semi-honest variant, our protocol incurs only a constant factor overhead, both in computation and communication. The constant-round and constant-rate properties hold even in the plain model.",

    "abstract": "Statistical Fault Attacks (SFA), introduced by Fuhr et al., exploit the statistical bias resulting from injected faults. Unlike prior fault analysis attacks, which require both faulty and correct ciphertexts under the same key, SFA leverages only faulty ciphertexts. In CHES 2018, more powerful attacks called Statistical Ineffective Fault Attacks (SIFA) have been proposed. In contrast to the previous fault attacks that utilize faulty ciphertexts, SIFA exploits the distribution of the intermediate values leading to fault-free ciphertexts. As a result, the SIFA attacks were shown to be effective even in the presence of widely used fault injection countermeasures based on detection and infection. In this work, we build upon the core idea of SIFA, and provide two main practical improvements over the previously proposed analysis methods. Firstly, we show how to perform SIFA from the input side, which in contrast to the original SIFA, requires injecting faults in the earlier rounds of an encryption or decryption operation. If we consider the start of the operation as the trigger for fault injection, the cumulative jitter in the first few rounds of a cipher is much lower than the last rounds. Hence, performing the attack in the first or second round requires a narrower parameter range for fault injection and hence less fault injection attempts to recover the secret key. Secondly, in comparison to the straightforward SIFA approach of guessing 32-bits at a time, we propose a chosen input approach that reduces the guessing effort to 16-bits at a time. This decreases the key search space for full key recovery of an AES-128 implementation from $2^{34}$ to $2^{19}$.",

    "abstract": "Randomized Partial Checking (RPC} was proposed  by Jakobsson, Juels, and Rivest and attracted attention as an efficient method of verifying the correctness of the mixing process in numerous applied scenarios. In fact,\r\nRPC is a building block for many electronic voting schemes, including Pr\u00eat \u00e0 Voter, Civitas, Scantegrity II  as well as voting-systems used in real-world elections (e.g., in Australia). Mixing is also used in anonymous transfers of cryptocurrencies.\r\n\r\nIt turned out, however, that a series of works showed, however,  \r\nsubtle issues with analyses behind RPC. First, that the actual\r\nsecurity level of the RPC protocol is way off the claimed bounds. The probability of successful manipulation of $k$ votes is $(\\frac{3}{4})^k$ instead of the claimed $\\frac{1}{2^k}$ (this difference, in turn, negatively affects actual implementations of the notion within existing election systems. This is so since concrete implemented procedures of a given length were directly based on this parameter).\r\n\r\nFurther, privacy guarantees that a constant number of mix-servers is enough turned out to also not be correct. We can conclude from the above that these analyses of the processes of mixing are not trivial.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we review the relevant attacks, and we present Mirrored-RPC -- a fix  to RPC based on ``mirrored commitment'' which makes it optimally secure; namely, having a probability of successful manipulation of $k$ votes $\\frac{1}{2^k}$.\r\n\r\nThen, we present an analysis of the privacy level of both RPC and mRPC. We show that for $n$ messages, the number of mix-servers (rounds) needed to be $\\varepsilon$-close to the uniform distribution in total variation distance is lower bounded by:\r\n\\[\r\n r(n, \\varepsilon) \\geq \\log_{2}{n \\choose 2}/\\varepsilon.\r\n\\]\r\n\r\nThis proof of privacy, in turn, gives insights into the anonymity of various cryptocurrencies (e.g., Zerocash) using anonymizing pools. If a random fraction $q$ of $n$ existing coins is mixed (in each block), then to achieve full anonymity, the number of blocks one needs to run the protocol for, is:\r\n\\[\r\n rb(n, q, \\varepsilon) \\geq - \\frac{\\log n + \\log (n-1) - \\log (2\\varepsilon)}{ {\\log({1-q^2}})}.\r\n\\]",

    "abstract": "We present a novel technique within the MPC-in-the-Head framework, aiming to design efficient zero-knowledge protocols and digital signature schemes. The technique allows for the simultaneous use of additive and multiplicative sharings of secret information, enabling efficient proofs of linear and multiplicative relations. \r\nThe applications of our technique are manifold. It is first applied to construct zero-knowledge arguments of knowledge for Double Discrete Logarithms (DDLP). The resulting protocol achieves improved communication complexity without compromising efficiency. We also propose a new zero-knowledge argument of knowledge for the Permuted Kernel Problem. Eventually, we suggest a short (candidate) post-quantum digital signature scheme constructed from a new one-way function based on simple polynomials known as fewnomials. This scheme offers simplicity and ease of implementation. \r\nFinally, we present two additional results inspired by this work but using alternative approaches. We propose a zero-knowledge argument of knowledge of an RSA plaintext for a small public exponent that significantly improves the state-of-the-art communication complexity.\r\nWe also detail a more efficient forward-backward construction for the DDLP.",

    "abstract": "Physical attacks pose a substantial threat to the secure implementation of cryptographic algorithms. While considerable research efforts are dedicated to protecting against passive physical attacks (e.g., side-channel analysis (SCA)), the landscape of protection against other types of physical attacks remains a challenge. Fault attacks (FA), though attracting growing attention in research, still lack the prevalence of provably secure designs when compared to SCA. The realm of combined attacks, which leverage the capabilities of both SCA and FA adversaries, introduces powerful adversarial models, rendering protection against them challenging. This challenge has consequently led to a relatively unexplored area of research, resulting in a notable gap in understanding and efficiently protecting against combined attacks. The CAPA countermeasure, published at CRYPTO 2018, addresses this challenge with a robust adversarial model that goes beyond conventional SCA and FA adversarial models. Drawing inspiration from the principles of Multiparty Computation (MPC), CAPA claims security against higher-order SCA, higher-order fault attacks, and their combination. In this work, we present a combined attack that breaks CAPA within the constraints of its assumed adversarial model. In response, we propose potential fixes to the design of CAPA that increase the complexity of the proposed attack, although not provably thwarting it. With this presented combined attack, we highlight the difficulty of effectively protecting against combined attacks.",

    "abstract": "Differential cryptanalysis is an old and powerful attack against block ciphers. While different techniques have been introduced throughout the years to improve the complexity of this attack, the key recovery phase remains a tedious and error-prone procedure. In this work, we propose a new algorithm and its associated tool that permits, given a distinguisher, to output an efficient key guessing strategy. Our tool can be applied to SPN ciphers whose linear layer consists of a bit-permutation and whose key schedule is linear or almost linear. It can be used not only to help cryptanalysts find the best differential attack on a given cipher but also to assist designers in their security analysis. We applied our tool to four targets: RECTANGLE, PRESENT-80, SPEEDY-7-192 and GIFT-64. We extend the previous best attack on RECTANGLE-128 by one round and the previous best differential attack against PRESENT-80 by 2 rounds. We improve a previous key recovery step in an attack against SPEEDY and present more efficient key recovery strategies for RECTANGLE-80 and GIFT. Our tool outputs the results in only a second for most targets.",

    "abstract": "Since the first fault attack by Boneh et al. in 1997, various physical fault injection mechanisms have been explored to induce errors in electronic systems. Subsequent fault analysis methods of these errors have been studied, and successfully used to attack many cryptographic implementations. This poses a significant challenge to the secure implementation of cryptographic algorithms. To address this, numerous countermeasures have been proposed. Nevertheless, these countermeasures are primarily designed to protect against the particular assumptions made by the fault analysis methods. These assumptions, however, encompass only a limited range of the capabilities inherent to physical fault injection mechanisms.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we narrow our focus to fault attacks and countermeasures specific to ASICs, and introduce a novel parameterized fault adversary model capturing an adversary's control over an ASIC. We systematically map (a) the physical fault injection mechanisms, (b) adversary models assumed in fault analysis, and (c) adversary models used to design countermeasures into our introduced model. This model forms the basis for our comprehensive exploration that covers a broad spectrum of fault attacks and countermeasures within symmetric key cryptography as a comprehensive survey. Furthermore, our investigation highlights a notable misalignment among the adversary models assumed in countermeasures, fault attacks, and the intrinsic capabilities of the physical fault injection mechanisms. Through this study, we emphasize the need to reevaluate existing fault adversary models, and advocate for the development of a unified model.",

    "abstract": "We consider a secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scenario, in which a signal is transmitted through a state-dependent wiretap channel with one legitimate receiver with which the transmitter communicates and one honest-but-curious target that the transmitter wants to sense. The secure ISAC channel is modeled as two state-dependent fast-fading channels with correlated Rayleigh fading coefficients and independent additive Gaussian noise components. Delayed channel outputs are fed back to the transmitter to improve the communication performance and to estimate the channel state sequence. We establish and illustrate an achievable secrecy-distortion region for degraded secure ISAC channels under correlated Rayleigh fading. We also evaluate the inner bound for a large set of parameters to derive practical design insights for secure ISAC methods. The presented results include in particular parameter ranges for which the secrecy capacity of a classical wiretap channel setup is surpassed and for which the channel capacity is approached.",

    "abstract": "Pseudorandom Quantum States (PRS) were introduced by Ji, Liu and Song as quantum analogous to Pseudorandom Generators. They are an ensemble of states efficiently computable but computationally indistinguishable from Haar random states. Subsequent works have shown that some cryptographic primitives can be constructed from PRSs. Moreover, recent classical and quantum oracle separations of PRS from One-Way Functions strengthen the interest in a purely quantum alternative building block for quantum cryptography, potentially weaker than OWFs.\r\n\r\nHowever, our lack of knowledge of extending or shrinking the number of qubits of the PRS output still makes it difficult to reproduce some of the classical proof techniques and results. Short-PRSs, that is PRSs with logarithmic size output, have been introduced in the literature along with cryptographic applications, but we still do not know how they relate to PRSs. Here we answer half of the question, by showing that it is not possible to shrink the output of a PRS from polynomial to logarithmic qubit length while still preserving the pseudorandomness property, in a relativized way. More precisely, we show that relative to Kretschmer's quantum oracle (TQC 2021) short-PRSs cannot exist (while PRSs exist, as shown by Kretschmer's work).",

This paper introduces IDEA-DAC, a paradigm shift from the conventional revoke-and-reissue methods, promoting direct and Integrity-Driven Editing (IDE) for Accountable DACs, which results in better integrity accountability, traceability, and system simplicity. We further incorporate an Edit-bound Conformity Check that ensures tailored integrity standards during credential amendments using R1CS-based ZK-SNARKs. Delving deeper, we propose ZK-JSON, a unique R1CS circuit design tailored for IDE over generic JSON documents. This design imposes strictly $O(N)$ rank-1 constraints for variable-length JSON documents of up to $N$ bytes in length, encompassing serialization, encryption, and edit-bound conformity checks. Additionally, our circuits only necessitate a one-time compilation, setup, and smart contract deployment for homogeneous JSON documents up to a specified size. While preserving core DAC features such as selective disclosure, anonymity, and predicate provability, IDEA-DAC achieves precise data modification checks without revealing private content, ensuring only authorized edits are permitted. In summary, IDEA-DAC offers an enhanced methodology for large-scale JSON-formatted credential systems, setting a new standard in decentralized identity management efficiency and precision.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the notion of registered attribute-based signature (registered ABS). Distinctly different from classical attribute-based signature (ABS), registered ABS allows any user to generate their own public/secret key pair and register it with the system. The key curator is critical to keep the system flowing, which is a fully transparent entity that does not retain secrets.  Our results can be summarized as follows.\r\n\r\n-This paper provides the first definition of registered ABS, which has never been defined.\r\n\r\n-This paper presents the first generic fully secure registered ABS over the prime-order group from $k$-Lin assumption under the standard model, which supports various classes of predicate.\r\n\r\n-This paper gives the first concrete registered ABS scheme for arithmetic branching program (ABP), which achieves  full security in the standard model. \r\n\r\nTechnically, our registered ABS is inspired by the blueprint of Okamoto and Takashima[PKC'11]. We convert the prime-order registered attribute-based encryption (registered ABE) scheme of Zhu et al.[ASIACRYPT'23] via predicate encoding to registered ABS by employing the technique of re-randomization with specialized delegation, while we employ the different dual-system method considering the property of registration. Prior to our work, the work of solving the key-escrow issue was presented by Okamoto and Takashima[PKC'13] while their work considered the weak adversary in the random oracle model.",

    "abstract": "Authenticated Encryption (AE) modes of operation based on Tweakable Block Ciphers (TBC) usually measure efficiency in the number of calls to the underlying primitive per message block. On the one hand, many existing solutions reach a primitive-rate of 1, meaning that  each n-bit block of message asymptotically needs a single call to the TBC with output length n. On the other hand, while these modes look optimal in a blackbox setting, they become less attractive when leakage comes into play, since all these calls must then be equally well protected to maintain security. Leakage-resistant modes improve this situation, by generating ephemeral keys every constant number of calls. However, rekeying is inherently suboptimal in primitive-rate, since a TBC call can only be used either to refresh a key or to encrypt a block. Even worse, existing solutions achieving almost n bits of security for n-bit secret keys have at most a primitive-rate 2/3. Hence the question: Can we design a highly-secure TBC-based rekeying mode with ``nearly optimal'' primitive-rate? We answer this question positively with Multiplex, a new mode that has primitive-rate d/(d+1) given a TBC with a dn-bit tweak. Multiplex achieves $n-\\log_2(dn)$ bits of security for both (i) misuse-resilience CCA security in the blackbox setting and (ii) Ciphertext Integrity with Misuse-resistant and unbounded Leakage in encryption and decryption (CIML2). It also provides (iii) confidentiality with leakage up to the birthday bound. Furthermore, Multiplex can run d+1 calls in parallel in each iteration. The combination of these features gives a mode of operation that inherits most of the good implementation features and flexibility of a Duplex sponge -- therefore paving the way towards sound comparisons between TBC-based and permutation-based AE.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new efficient hash function for imaginary class groups. Many class group based protocols, such as  verifiable delay functions, timed commitments and accumulators, rely on the existence of an efficient and secure hash function, but there are not many concrete constructions available in the literature, and existing constructions are too inefficient for practical use cases.\r\n\r\nOur novel approach, building on Wesolowski's initial scheme, achieves a 200 fold increase in computation speed, making it exceptionally practical for real-world applications. This optimisation is achieved at the cost of a smaller image of the hash function, but we show that the image is still sufficiently large for the hash function to be secure.",

    "abstract": "The Hidden Number Problem (HNP) has found extensive applications in side-channel attacks against cryptographic schemes, such as ECDSA and Diffie-Hellman. There are two primary algorithmic approaches to solving the HNP: lattice-based attacks and Fourier analysis-based attacks. Lattice-based attacks exhibit better efficiency and require fewer samples when sufficiently long substrings of the nonces are known. However, they face significant challenges when only a small fraction of the nonce is leaked, such as 1-bit leakage, and their performance degrades in the presence of errors.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we address an open question by introducing an algorithmic tradeoff that significantly bridges the gap between these two approaches. \r\nBy introducing a parameter $x$ to modify Albrecht and Heninger's lattice, the lattice dimension is reduced by approximately $(\\log_2{x})/ l$, where $l$ represents the number of leaked bits. We present a series of new methods, including the interval reduction algorithm, several predicates, and the pre-screening technique. Furthermore, we extend our algorithms to solve the HNP with erroneous input. Our attack outperforms existing state-of-the-art lattice-based attacks against ECDSA. We break several records including 1-bit and less than 1-bit leakage on a 160-bit curve, while the best previous lattice-based attack for 1-bit leakage was conducted only on a 112-bit curve.",

    "note": "The widespread use of neural networks in recent years has greatly improved our ability to handle complex tasks. These networks have proven effective in various applications, from generating fake images with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to exploring symmetric cryptography. Building on previous work by Mart\u00edn Abadi and David G Andersen, our research focuses on secure communication within a multiagent system, using an end-to-end adversarial training system with neural networks named Alice, Bob, and Eve.\r\n\r\nWe aim to enhance confidentiality properties, crucial for secure communication, by employing flexible end-to-end adversarial training instead of traditional cryptographic approaches. This approach allows neural networks Alice and Bob to adapt dynamically to potential threats, particularly addressing interception by a third network, Eve.\r\n\r\nExpanding on previous work, our research conducts comprehensive experiments with message sizes ranging from 4 to 1024 bits, adjusting batch sizes and training steps to understand how neural networks scale in mastering encryption and decryption processes across different conditions.\r\n\r\nA key aspect of our research is training model Bob to approach minimal error values, refining the learning process and emphasizing confidentiality goals. Our paper is structured into sections covering introduction, model overview, experiments, results and analyses, testing, and conclusions, highlighting the potential impact on the community.\r\n\r\nEach aspect of our research provides unique benefits, from exploring diverse message sizes to dynamic adjustments that enhance scalability and efficiency. By minimizing Bob's error, we aim to achieve the highest levels of confidentiality in secure communication. Overall, this research significantly advances our understanding of neural network adaptability and optimization potential, paving the way for future advancements in secure information exchange.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the cryptanalysis of the ASCON family using automatic tools. We analyze two different problems with the goal to obtain new modelings, both simpler and less computationally heavy than previous works (all our models require only a small amount of code and run on regular desktop computers).\r\n\r\nThe first problem is the search for Meet-in-the-middle attacks on reduced-round ASCON-Hash. Starting from the MILP modeling of Qin et al. (EUROCRYPT 2023 & ePrint 2023), we rephrase the problem in SAT, which accelerates significantly the solving time and removes the need for the ``weak diffusion structure'' heuristic. This allows us to reduce the memory complexity of Qin et al.'s attacks and to prove some optimality results.\r\n\r\nThe second problem is the search for lower bounds on the probability of differential characteristics for the ASCON permutation. We introduce a lossy MILP encoding of the propagation rules based on the Hamming weight, in order to find quickly lower bounds which are comparable to the state of the art. We find a small improvement over the existing bound on 7 rounds.",

    "abstract": "We uncover a critical side-channel vulnerability in the Hamming Quasi-Cyclic (HQC) round 4 optimized implementation arising due to the use of the modulo operator. In some cases, compilers optimize uses of the modulo operator with compile-time known divisors into constant-time Barrett reductions. However, this optimization is not guaranteed: for example, when a modulo operation is used in a loop the compiler may emit division (div) instructions which have variable execution time depending on the numerator. When the numerator depends on secret data, this may yield a timing side-channel. We name vulnerabilities of this kind Divide and\r\nSurrender (DaS) vulnerabilities.\r\nFor processors supporting Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) we propose a new approach called DIV-SMT which enables precisely measuring small division timing variations using scheduler and/or execution unit contention. We show that using only 100 such side-channel traces we can build a Plaintext-Checking (PC) oracle with above 90% accuracy. Our approach may also prove applicable to other instances of the DaS vulnerability, such as KyberSlash. We stress that exploitation with DIV-SMT requires co-location of the attacker on the same physical core as the victim.\r\nWe then apply our methodology to HQC and present a novel way to recover HQC secret keys faster, achieving an 8-fold decrease in the number of idealized oracle queries when compared to previous approaches. Our new PC oracle attack uses our newly developed Zero Tester method to quickly determine whether an entire block of bits contains only zero-bits. The Zero Tester method enables the DIV-SMT powered attack on HQC-128 to complete in under 2 minutes on our targeted AMD Zen2\r\nmachine.",

    "abstract": "Since the seminal works by Sasaki and Aoki, Meet-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks are recognized as an effective technique for preimage and collision attacks on hash functions. At Eurocrypt 2021, Bao et al. automated MITM attacks on AES-like hashing and improved upon the best manual result. The attack framework has been furnished by subsequent works, yet far from complete. This paper elucidates three key contributions dedicated in further generalizing the idea of MITM and refining the automatic model on AES-like hashing. (1) We introduce S-box linearization to MITM pseudo-preimage attacks on AES-like hashing. The technique suits perfectly with superposition states to preserve information after S-box with an affordable cost. (2) We propose distributed initial structures, an extension on the original concept of initial states, that selects initial degrees of freedom in a more versatile manner to enlarge the search space. (3) We exploit the structural similarities between encryption and key schedule in constructions (e.g. Whirlpool and Streebog) to model propagations more accurately and avoid repeated costs. Weaponed with these innovative techniques, we further empower the MITM framework and improve the attack results on AES-like designs for preimage and collision. We obtain the first preimage attacks on 10-round AES-192, 10-round Rijndael-192/256, and 7.75-round Whirlpool, reduced time and/or memory complexities for preimage attacks on 5-, 6-round Whirlpool and 7.5-, 8.5-round Streebog, as well as improved collision attacks on 6- and 6.5-round Whirlpool.",

    "abstract": "Uniformly random unitaries, i.e., unitaries drawn from the Haar measure, have many useful properties, but cannot be implemented efficiently. This has motivated a long line of research into random unitaries that ``look'' sufficiently Haar random while also being efficient to implement.\r\nTwo different notions of derandomisation have emerged: \r\n$t$-designs are random unitaries that information-theoretically reproduce the first $t$ moments of the Haar measure, and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) are random unitaries that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar random. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we take a unified approach to constructing $t$-designs and PRUs. For this, we introduce and analyse the ``$PFC$ ensemble'', the product of a random computational basis permutation $P$, a random binary phase operator $F$, and a random Clifford unitary $C$. We show that this ensemble reproduces exponentially high moments of the Haar measure. We can then derandomise the $PFC$ ensemble to show the following: \r\n\r\n1. Linear-depth $t$-designs. We give the first construction of a (diamond-error) approximate $t$-design with circuit depth linear in $t$. This follows from the $PFC$ ensemble by replacing the random phase and permutation operators with their $2t$-wise independent counterparts.\r\n\r\n2. Non-adaptive PRUs. We give the first construction of PRUs with non-adaptive security, i.e., we construct unitaries that are indistinguishable from Haar random to polynomial-time distinguishers that query the unitary in parallel on an arbitary state. This follows from the $PFC$ ensemble by replacing the random phase and permutation operators with their pseudorandom counterparts.\r\n\r\n3. Adaptive pseudorandom isometries. We show that if one considers isometries (rather than unitaries) from $n$ to $n + \\omega(\\log n)$ qubits, a small modification of our PRU construction achieves adaptive security, i.e., even a distinguisher that can query the isometry adaptively in sequence cannot distinguish it from Haar random isometries. This gives the first construction of adaptive pseudorandom isometries. Under an additional conjecture, this proof also extends to adaptive PRUs.",

    "abstract": "Recently, many works have considered Private Information Retrieval (PIR) with client-preprocessing: In this model a client and a server jointly run a preprocessing phase, after which client queries can run in time sublinear in the size of the database. In addition, such  approaches store no additional bits per client at the server, allowing us to scale PIR to a large number of clients.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose the first client-preprocessing PIR scheme with ``single pass'' client-preprocessing. In particular, our scheme is concretely optimal with respect to preprocessing, in the sense that it requires exactly one linear pass over the database. This is in stark contrast with existing works, whose preprocessing is proportional to $\\lambda \\cdot N$, where $\\lambda$ is the security parameter (e.g., $\\lambda=128$). Our approach yields a preprocessing speedup of 45-100$\\times$ and a query speedup of up to 20$\\times$ when compared to previous state-of-the-art schemes (e.g., Checklist, USENIX 2021), making preprocessing PIR more attractive for a myriad of use cases that are ``session-based''. \r\n\r\nIn addition to fast preprocessing, our scheme features extremely fast updates (additions and edits)---in constant time. Previously, the best known approach for handling updates in client-preprocessing PIR had time complexity $O(\\log N)$, while also adding a $\\log N$ factor to the bandwidth. We implement our update algorithm and show concrete speedups of about 20$\\times$ in update time when compared to the previous state-of-the-art updatable scheme (e.g., Checklist, USENIX 2021).",

    "abstract": "Sharding is a critical technique that enhances the scalability of blockchain technology. However, existing protocols often assume adversarial nodes in a general term without considering the different types of attacks, which limits transaction throughput at runtime because attacks on liveness could be mitigated. There have been attempts to increase transaction throughput by separately handling the attacks; however, they have security vulnerabilities. This paper introduces Reticulum, a novel sharding protocol that overcomes these limitations and achieves enhanced scalability in a blockchain network without security vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nReticulum employs a two-phase design that dynamically adjusts transaction throughput based on runtime adversarial attacks on either or both liveness and safety. It consists of `control' and `process' shards in two layers corresponding to the two phases. Process shards are subsets of control shards, with each process shard expected to contain at least one honest node with high confidence. Conversely, control shards are expected to have a majority of honest nodes with high confidence. Reticulum leverages unanimous voting in the first phase to involve fewer nodes in accepting/rejecting a block, allowing more parallel process shards. The control shard finalizes the decision made in the first phase and serves as a lifeline to resolve disputes when they surface.\r\n\r\nExperiments demonstrate that the unique design of Reticulum empowers high transaction throughput and robustness in the face of different types of attacks in the network, making it superior to existing sharding protocols for blockchain networks.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we focus on Single-Input Functionality (SIF), which can be viewed as a special case of MPC. In a SIF, only one distinguished party called the dealer holds a private input. SIF allows the dealer to perform a computation task with other parties without revealing any additional information about the private input. SIF has diverse applications, including multiple-verifier zero-knowledge, and verifiable relation sharing.\r\n\r\nAs our main contribution, we propose the first 1-round SIF protocol against a dishonest majority in the preprocessing model, which is highly efficient. The prior works either require at least 2-round online communication (Yang and Wang, Asiacrypt 2022; Baum et al., CCS 2022; Zhou et al., Euro SP 2024) or are only feasibility results (Lepinski et al., TCC 2005; Applebaum et al., Crypto 2022). We show the necessity of using the broadcast channels, by formally proving that 1-round SIF is impossible to achieve in the preprocessing model, if there are no broadcast channels available. We implement our protocol and conduct extensive experiments to illustrate the practical efficiency of our protocol. \r\n\r\nAs our side product, we extend the subfield Vector Oblivious Linear Evaluation (sVOLE) into the multi-party setting, and propose a new primitive called multiple-verifier sVOLE, which may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Polynomial commitment is a crucial cryptographic primitive in constructing zkSNARKs. Most practical constructions to date are either vulnerable against quantum adversaries or lack homomorphic properties, which are essential for recursive proof composition and proof batching. Recently, lattice-based constructions have drawn attention for their potential to achieve all the desirable properties, though they often suffer from concrete inefficiency or rely on newly introduced assumptions requiring further cryptanalysis.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose a novel construction of a polynomial commitment scheme based on standard lattice-based assumptions. Our scheme achieves a square-root proof size and verification complexity, ensuring concrete efficiency in proof size, proof generation, and verification. Additionally, it features a transparent setup and publicly verifiability.\r\n\r\nWhen compared with Brakedown (CRYPTO 2023), a recent code-based construction, our scheme offers comparable performance across all metrics. Furthermore, its proof size is approximately 4.1 times smaller than SLAP (EUROCRYPT 2024), a recent lattice-based construction.",

    "abstract": "Decoy accounts are often used as an indicator of the compromise of sensitive data, such as password files. An attacker targeting only specific known-to-be-real accounts might, however, remain undetected. A more effective method proposed by Juels and Rivest at CCS'13 is to maintain additional fake passwords associated with each account. An attacker who gains access to the password file is unable to tell apart real passwords from fake passwords, and the attempted usage of a false password immediately sets off an alarm indicating a password file compromise.\r\nPassword-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) has long been recognised for its strong security guarantees when it comes to low-entropy password authentication and secure channel establishment, without having to rely on the setup of a PKI. In this paper, we introduce SweetPAKE, a new cryptographic primitive that offers the same security guarantees as PAKE for key exchange, while allowing clients with a single password to authenticate against servers with $n$ candidate passwords for that account and establish a secure channel. Additional security properties are identified and formalized to ensure that (a) high-entropy session keys are indistinguishable from random, even if later on the long-term secret password becomes corrupted (forward secrecy); (b) upon password file leakage, an adversary cannot tell apart real from fake passwords; and (c) a malicious client cannot trigger a false alarm. We capture these properties by extending well-established game-based definitions of PAKE. Furthermore, we propose a new UC formulation that comprehensively unifies both SweetPAKE (session key indistinguishability and sugarword indistinguishability) and a related notion known as Oblivious-PAKE. Finally, we propose efficient SweetPAKE and Oblivious-PAKE protocols constructed from Password-Authenticated Public-Key Encryption (PAPKE) that satisfy all the proposed notions.",

    "abstract": "Driven by the NIST's post-quantum standardization efforts and the selection of Kyber as a lattice-based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM), several Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocols have been recently proposed that leverage a KEM to create an efficient, easy-to-implement and secure PAKE. In two recent works, Beguinet et al. (ACNS 2023) and Pan and Zeng (ASIACRYPT 2023) proposed generic compilers that transform KEM into PAKE, relying on an Ideal Cipher (IC) defined over a group. However, although IC on a group is often used in cryptographic protocols, special care must be taken to instantiate such objects in practice, especially when a low-entropy key is used. To address this concern, Dos Santos et al. (EUROCRYPT 2023) proposed a relaxation of the IC model under the Universal Composability (UC) framework called Half-Ideal Cipher (HIC). They demonstrate how to construct a UC-secure PAKE protocol, EKE-KEM, from a KEM and a modified 2-round Feistel construction called m2F. Remarkably, the m2F sidesteps the use of an IC over a group, and instead employs an IC defined over a fixed-length bitstring domain, which is easier to instantiate.\r\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel PAKE protocol called CHIC that improves the communication and computation efficiency of EKE-KEM, by avoiding the HIC abstraction. Instead, we split the KEM public key in two parts and use the m2F directly, without further randomization. We provide a detailed proof of the security of CHIC and establish precise security requirements for the underlying KEM, including one-wayness and anonymity of ciphertexts, and uniformity of public keys. Our findings extend to general KEM-based EKE-style protocols and show that a passively secure KEM is not sufficient. In this respect, our results align with those of Pan and Zeng (ASIACRYPT 2023), but contradict the analyses of KEM-to-PAKE compilers by Beguinet et al. (ACNS 2023) and Dos Santos et al. (EUROCRYPT 2023).\r\nFinally, we provide an implementation of CHIC, highlighting its minimal overhead compared to the underlying KEM -- Kyber. An interesting aspect of the implementation is that we reuse the rejection sampling procedure in Kyber reference code to address the challenge of hashing onto the public key space. As of now, to the best of our knowledge, CHIC stands as the most efficient PAKE protocol from black-box KEM that offers rigorously proven UC security.",

    "abstract": "LoPher brings, for the first time, cryptographic security promises to the field of logic locking in a bid to break the game of cat-and-mouse seen in logic locking. Toward this end, LoPher embeds the circuitry to lock within multiple rounds of a block cipher, by carefully configuring all the S-Boxes. To realize general Boolean functionalities and to support varying interconnect topologies, LoPher also introduces additional layers of MUXes between S-Boxes and the permutation operations. The authors of LoPher claim resilience against SAT-based attacks in particular. Here, we show the first successful attack on LoPher. First, we uncover a significant limitation for LoPher\u2019s key-space configuration, resulting in large numbers of equivalent keys and, thus, a largely simplified search space for attackers in practice. Second, motivated by their well-proven working against ciphers, we employ a power side-channel attack against LoPher. We find that ISCAS-85 benchmarks locked with LoPher can all be broken in few thousands of traces. Finally, we also outline a simple and low-cost countermeasure to render LoPher more secure.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we construct dedicated weight orders $>$ so that a $>$-Gr\u00f6bner bases of Poseidon can be found via linear transformations for the preimage as well as the CICO problem. In particular, with our Gr\u00f6bner bases we can exactly compute the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-vector space dimension of the quotient space for all possible Poseidon configurations. This in turn resolves previous attempts to assess the security of Poseidon against Gr\u00f6bner basis attacks, since the vector space dimension quantifies the complexity of computing the variety of a zero-dimensional polynomial system.",

    "abstract": "Several prior works have suggested to use non-interactive arguments of knowledge with short proofs to aggregate signatures of Falcon, which is part of the first post-quantum signatures selected for standardization by NIST. Especially LaBRADOR, based on standard structured lattice  assumptions and published at CRYPTO\u201923, seems promising to realize this task. However, no prior work has tackled this idea in a rigorous way. In this paper, we thoroughly prove how to aggregate Falcon signatures using LaBRADOR. We start by providing the first complete knowledge soundness analysis for the non-interactive version of LaBRADOR. Here, the multi-round and recursive nature of LaBRADOR requires a complex and thorough analysis. For this purpose, we introduce the notion of predicate special soundness (PSS). This is a general framework for evaluating the knowledge error of complex Fiat-Shamir arguments of knowledge protocols in a modular fashion, which we believe to be of independent interest. We then explain the exact steps to take in order to adapt the non-interactive LaBRADOR proof system for aggregating Falcon signatures and provide concrete proof size estimates. Additionally, we formalize the folklore approach of obtaining aggregate signatures from the class of hash-then-sign signatures through arguments of knowledge.",

    "note": "Changelog (August 9, 2024)\r\n\r\nTechnical:\r\n\u2013 In our instantation of LaBRADOR, where we previously recommended the use of a high-splitting ring, we now recommend using a 2-splitting ring bringing us closer to the original parameters in [BS23]. Through the lifting approach from [CHK+ 21], this allows both shorter proofs and more efficient ring computations. We report our improved aggregate signature sizes in Section 7.\r\n\u2013 We highlight how our approach can be adapted to the same synchronized model as Squirrel [FSZ22] and Chipmunk [FHSZ23], giving sublinear sizes by eliminating the need for salts.\r\n\r\nEditorial:\r\n\u2013 Restructured and improved the exposition for predicate special soundness. Section 4 gives preliminaries on multi-round special soundness, and exemplifies its limitations with a worked example. Section 5 introduces predicate special soundness definitions and applies them to the example from Section 4.\r\n\u2013 Section 7 now has a greater emphasis on concrete aggregate signature sizes and comparisons to existing schemes.\r\n\u2013 Various minor editorial changes.",

    "abstract": "Memory-hard functions (MHF) are functions whose evaluation provably requires a lot of memory. While MHFs are an unkeyed primitive, it is natural to consider the notion of trapdoor MHFs (TMHFs). A TMHF is like an MHF, but when sampling the public parameters one also samples a trapdoor which allows evaluating the function much cheaper.\r\n\r\nBiryukov and Perrin (Asiacrypt'17) were the first to consider TMHFs and put forth a candidate TMHF construction called Diodon that is based on the Scrypt MHF (Percival, BSDCan'09). To allow for a trapdoor, Scrypt's initial hash chain is replaced by a sequence of squares in a group of unknown order where the order of the group is the trapdoor. For a length $n$ sequence of squares and a group of order $N$, Diodon's cumulative memory complexity (CMC) is $O(n^2\\log N)$ without the trapdoor and $O(n \\log(n) \\log(N)^2)$ with knowledge of it.\r\n\r\nWhile Scrypt is proven to be optimally memory-hard in the random oracle model (Alwen et al., Eurocrypt'17), Diodon's memory-hardness has not been proven so far. In this work, we fill this gap by rigorously analyzing a specific instantiation of Diodon. We show that its CMC is lower bounded by $\\Omega(\\frac{n^2}{\\log n} \\log N)$ which almost matches the upper bound. Our proof is based Alwen et al.'s lower bound on Scrypt's CMC but requires non-trivial modifications due to the algebraic structure of Diodon. Most importantly, our analysis involves a more elaborate compression argument and a solvability criterion for certain systems of Diophantine equations.",

    "abstract": "Arora & Ge introduced a noise-free polynomial system to compute the secret of a Learning With Errors (LWE) instance via linearization. Albrecht et al. later utilized the Arora-Ge polynomial model to study the complexity of Gr\u00f6bner basis computations on LWE polynomial systems under the assumption of semi-regularity. In this paper we revisit the Arora-Ge polynomial and prove that it satisfies a genericity condition recently introduced by Caminata & Gorla, called being in generic coordinates. For polynomial systems in generic coordinates one can always estimate the complexity of DRL Gr\u00f6bner basis computations in terms of the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity and henceforth also via the Macaulay bound.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we generalize the Gr\u00f6bner basis algorithm of Semaev & Tenti to arbitrary polynomial systems with a finite degree of regularity. In particular, existence of this algorithm yields another approach to estimate the complexity of DRL Gr\u00f6bner basis computations in terms of the degree of regularity. In practice, the degree of regularity of LWE polynomial systems is not known, though one can always estimate the lowest achievable degree of regularity. Consequently, from a designer's worst case perspective this approach yields sub-exponential complexity estimates for general, binary secret and binary error LWE.\r\n\r\nIn recent works by Dachman-Soled et al. the hardness of LWE in the presence of side information was analyzed.\r\nUtilizing their framework we discuss how hints can be incorporated into LWE polynomial systems and how they affect the complexity of Gr\u00f6bner basis computations.",

    "abstract": "The AES block cipher is today the most important and analyzed symmetric algorithm. While all versions of the AES are known to be secure in the single-key setting, this is not the case in the related-key scenario. In this article we try to answer the question whether the AES would resist better differential-like related-key attacks if the key schedule was different. For this, we search for alternative permutation-based key schedules by extending the work of Khoo et al. at ToSC 2017 and Derbez et al. at SAC 2018. We first show that the model of Derbez et al. was flawed. Then, we develop different approaches together with MILP-based tools to find good permutations that could be used as the key schedule for AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256. Our methods permitted to find permutations that outperform the permutation exhibited by Khoo et al. for AES-128. Moreover, our new approach based on two MILP models that call one another allowed us to handle a larger search space and thus to search for alternative key schedules for the two bigger versions of AES. This method permitted us to find permutations for AES-192 and AES-256 that provide better resistance to related-key differential attacks. Most importantly, we showed that these variants can resist full-round boomerang attacks.",

    "abstract": "The folklore approach to designing a threshold variant of symmetric\r\ncryptographic algorithms involves applying generic MPC methods to se-\r\ncret sharing techniques: the MPC first combines participant input shares\r\nusing the secret sharing scheme, and then evaluates the cryptographic\r\nfunction on the reconstructed key. Hardening this secure against n \u2212 1\r\nmalicious parties requires some mechanism to ensure input consistency,\r\ne.g., adding MACs to inputs, which consequently, increases the number\r\nof inputs and gates to the MPC. In many cases, this extra overhead is\r\nsubstantially more than the underlying cost of evaluating the symmetric\r\ncryptographic algorithm.\r\nWe present a scheme that can convert any suitable maliciously secure\r\ndishonest majority boolean-circuit FMPC into a threshold scheme Fthresh\r\nwith almost no overhead. Specifically, we present an SUC-secure scheme\r\nthat allows for reactive threshold t-of-n boolean circuit evaluation amongst\r\na group of n parties P , for any t \u2264 n, against a malicious adversary that\r\ncorrupts any number of parties less than the threshold t. Moreover, mul-\r\ntiple circuits can be evaluated sequentially with the secret-shared authen-\r\nticated outputs of a circuit to be used subsequently as inputs for a new\r\ncircuit by any S \u2286 P of size |S| \u2265 t.\r\nBuilding upon the works of Wang et al, Hazay et al, and Yang et al,\r\n[WRK17, HSSV17, YWZ20] for dishonest majority FMPC, our key insight\r\nis to create threshold versions of the \u201cauthenticated bits\u201d used to han-\r\ndle input in these recent n-party garbled circuits protocols. The resulting\r\ndesign incurs a small overhead to produce the reusable \u201cthreshold authen-\r\nticated bits\u201d during preprocessing, and adds no extra communication to\r\nevaluate with the authenticated input during the online phase.\r\nUsing our methods, thresholdizing a boolean circuit has essentially no\r\nperformance overhead. For example, to compute HMAC, a full Setup+Eval\r\nexecution of the (n \u2212 2)-out-of-n thresholdized version is approximately\r\n4% more expensive than the state-of-the-art n-party MPC. In contrast,\r\nusing the folklore method is approximately 100% more expensive. This is\r\nespecially true for small circuits such as AES which has 6800 gates and\r\nthus incurs the most overhead for thresholdizing. Simply considering the\r\nonline Eval cost, our approach can evaluate AES blocks at 2.3/s with 16 parties, exceeding the baseline MPC cost without preprocessing, and sur-\r\npassing the folklore method that only achieves .33/s blocks. Ultimately,\r\nthis result makes threshold boolean circuit MPC as feasible as any MPC\r\napplication.",

    "abstract": "In the consensus problem, $n$ parties want to agree on a common value, even if some of them are corrupt and arbitrarily misbehave. If the parties have a common input $m$, then they must agree on $m$.\r\n    \r\nProtocols solving consensus assume either a synchronous communication network, where messages are delivered within a known time, or an asynchronous network with arbitrary delays. Asynchronous protocols only tolerate $t_a < n/3$ corrupt parties. Synchronous ones can tolerate $t_s < n/2$ corruptions with setup, but their security completely breaks down if the synchrony assumptions are violated.\r\n    \r\nNetwork-agnostic consensus protocols, as introduced by Blum, Katz, and Loss [TCC'19], are secure regardless of network conditions, tolerating up to $t_s$ corruptions with synchrony and $t_a$ without, under provably optimal assumptions $t_a \\leq t_s$ and $2t_s + t_a < n$. Despite efforts to improve their efficiency, all known network-agnostic protocols fall short of the asymptotic complexity of state-of-the-art purely synchronous protocols. \r\n   \r\nIn this work, we introduce a novel technique to compile any synchronous and any asynchronous consensus protocols into a network-agnostic one. This process only incurs a small constant number of overhead rounds, so that the compiled protocol matches the optimal round complexity for synchronous protocols. Our compiler also preserves under a variety of assumptions the asymptotic communication complexity of state-of-the-art synchronous and asynchronous protocols. Hence, it closes the current efficiency gap between synchronous and network-agnostic consensus.\r\n\r\nAs a plus, our protocols support $\\ell$-bit inputs, and can be extended to achieve communication complexity $O(n^2\\kappa + \\ell n)$ under the assumptions for which this is known to be possible for purely synchronous protocols.",

    "abstract": "We study single-server private information retrieval (PIR) where a client wishes to privately retrieve the $x$-th entry from a database held by a server without revealing the index $x$. In our work, we focus on PIR with client pre-processing where the client may compute hints during an offline phase. The hints are then leveraged during queries to obtain sub-linear online time. We present Plinko that is the first single-server PIR with client pre-processing that obtains optimal trade-offs between client storage and total (client and server) query time for all parameters. Our scheme uses $t = \\tilde{O}(n/r)$ query time for any client storage size $r$. This matches known lower bounds of $r \\cdot t = \\Omega(n)$ up to logarithmic factors for all parameterizations whereas prior works could only match the lower bound when $r = \\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$. Moreover, Plinko is also the first updateable PIR scheme where an entry can be updated in worst-case $\\tilde{O}(1)$ time.\r\n\r\nAs our main technical tool, we define the notion of an invertible pseudorandom function (iPRF) that generalizes standard PRFs to be equipped with an efficient inversion algorithm. We present a construction of an iPRF from one-way functions where forward evaluation runs in $\\tilde{O}(1)$ time and inversion runs in time linear in the inverse set (output) size. Furthermore, our iPRF construction is the first that remains efficient and secure for arbitrary domain and range sizes (including small domains and ranges). In the context of single-server PIR, we show that iPRFs may be used to construct the first hint set representation where finding a hint containing an entry $x$ may be done in $\\tilde{O}(1)$ time.",

Protocols of Noncommutative Cryptography implemented on the platform of Eulerian endomorphism are used for the delivery of G_i and A_i from Alice to Bob. One can use twisted Diffie-Hellman protocols which security rests on the complexity of Conjugacy Power problem or hidden tame homomorphism protocol which security rests of the word decomposition problem. Instead of the delivery of G_i Alice and Bob can elaborate these transformations via the inverse twisted Diffie-Hellman protocol implemented on the platform of tame Eulerian transformations of (Z*_{2^s})^n. The cost of single protocol is O(n^3) and the cost of the computation of the reimage of used nonlinear map is O(n^2). So the verification of n^t , t\u22651 signatures takes time O(n^{t+2}). Instead of inverse twisted Diffie-Hellman protocol correspondents can use inverse hidden tame homomorphism protocol which rests on the complexity of word decomposition for tame Eulerian transformations. We use natural bijections between Z*_{2^s} and Z_{2^{s-1}}, Z*_{2^s} and finite field F_{2^{s-1}} and  Z*_{2^s} and Boolean ring B_{s-1} of order 2^{s-1} to modify the family of ciphers or cryptosystems via the change of AGL_n(Z_{2^s}) for the AGL_n(K), where K is one of the rings \r\nZ_{2^{s-1}, F_{2^{s-1} and B_{s-1}. New ciphers are defined via the multiplications of two different commutative rings Z_{2^s} and K. It does not allow to treat them as stream ciphers of multivariate cryptography and use corresponding cryptanalytic technique.\r\nAdversary is not able to use known cryptanalytical methods such as linearisation attacks. We discuss the option of change  the mentioned above  elements of AGL_n(Z_{2^s) or AGL_n(K) for nonlinear multivariate transformation F of (Z_{2^s})^n or K^n with the symmetric trapdoor accelerator T, i.e. the piece of information such that  the knowledge of T allows to compute the value F(p)  in arbitrarily chosen p \u03f5 P in time O(n^2) and to solve the equation of kind F(x)=c  for each c from C in time O(n ^2).",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes POPSTAR, a new lightweight protocol for the private computation of heavy hitters, also known as a private threshold reporting system. In such a protocol, the users provide input measurements, and a report server learns which measurements appear more than a pre-specified threshold. POPSTAR follows the same architecture as STAR (Davidson et al, CCS 2022) by relying on a helper randomness server in addition to a main server computing the aggregate heavy hitter statistics. While STAR is extremely lightweight, it leaks a substantial amount of information, consisting of an entire histogram of the provided measurements (but only reveals the actual measurements that appear beyond the threshold). POPSTAR shows that this leakage can be reduced at a modest cost ($\\sim$7$\\times$ longer aggregation time). Our leakage is closer to that of Poplar (Boneh et al, S&P 2021), which relies however on distributed point functions and a different model which requires interactions of two non-colluding servers (with equal workloads) to compute the heavy hitters.",

    "abstract": "At CRYPTO 2019, Gohr demonstrated that differential-neural distinguishers (DNDs) for Speck32/64 can learn more features than classical cryptanalysis's differential distribution tables (DDT). Furthermore, a non-classical key recovery procedure is devised by combining the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategy and the BayesianKeySearch algorithm. Consequently, the time complexity of 11-round key recovery attacks on Speck32/64 is significantly reduced compared with the state-of-the-art results in classical cryptanalysis. This advancement in deep learning-assisted cryptanalysis has opened up new possibilities. However, the specific encryption features exploited by DNDs remain unclear.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we begin by analyzing the features learned by DND based on the probability distribution of a ciphertext pair. Our analysis reveals that DND not only learns the differential features of the ciphertext pair but also captures the XOR information of the left and right branches of the ciphertext pair. This explains why the performance of DND can outperform DDT in certain cases. For other ciphers, we can also predict whether deep learning methods can achieve superior results to classical methods based on the probability distribution of the ciphertext pair. Next, we modify the input data format and network structure based on the specific features that can be learned to train DND specifically. With these modifications, it is possible to reduce the size of their parameters to only 1/16 of their previous networks while maintaining high precision. Additionally, the training time for the DNDs is significantly reduced. Finally, to improve the efficiency of deep learning-assisted cryptanalysis, we introduce Bayes-UCB to select promising ciphertext structures more efficiently. We also introduce an improved BayesianKeySearch algorithm to retain guessed keys with the highest scores in key guessing. We use both methods to launch 11-round, 12-round, and 13-round key recovery attacks on Speck32/64. The results show that under the same conditions, the success rate of 11-round key recovery attacks has increased from Gohr's 36.1% to 52.8%, the success rate of 12-round key recovery attacks has increased from Gohr's 39% to 50%, and the success rate of 13-round key recovery attacks has increased from Zhang et al.'s 21% to 24%. In addition, the time complexity of these experiments is also significantly reduced.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel circuit bootstrapping algorithm that outperforms the state-of-the-art TFHE method with 9.9\u00d7 speedup and 15.6\u00d7 key size reduction. These improvements can be attributed to two technical contributions. Firstly, we redesigned the circuit bootstrapping workflow to operate exclusively  under the ring ciphertext type, which eliminates the need of conversion between LWE and RLWE ciphertexts. Secondly, we improve the LMKC+ blind rotation algorithm by reducing the number of automorphisms, then propose the first automorphism type multi-value functional bootstrapping. These automorphism-based techniques lead to further key size optimization, and are of independent interest besides circuit bootstrapping. Based our new circuit bootstrapping we can evaluate AES-128 in 26.2s (single thread), achieving 10.3\u00d7 speedup compared with the state-of-the-art TFHE-based approach.",

    "abstract": "A Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol allows two parties to agree upon a cryptographic key, in the setting where the only secret shared in advance is a low-entropy password. The standard security notion for PAKE is in the Universal Composability (UC) framework. In recent years there have been a large number of works analyzing the UC-security of Encrypted Key Exchange (EKE), the very first PAKE protocol, and its One-encryption variant (OEKE), both of which compile an unauthenticated Key Agreement (KA) protocol into a PAKE.\r\nIn this work, we present a comprehensive and thorough study of the UC-security of both EKE and OEKE in the most general setting and using the most efficient building blocks:\r\n1. We show that among the five existing results on the UC-security of (O)EKE using a general KA protocol, all are incorrect;\r\n2. We show that for (O)EKE to be UC-secure, the underlying KA protocol needs to satisfy several additional security properties: though some of these are closely related to existing security properties, some are new, and all are missing from existing works on (O)EKE;\r\n3. We give UC-security proofs for EKE and OEKE using Programmable-Once Public Function (POPF), which is the most efficient instantiation to date and is around 4 times faster\r\nthan the standard instantiation using Ideal Cipher (IC).\r\nOur results in particular allow for PAKE constructions from post-quantum KA protocols such as Kyber. We also present a security analysis of POPF using a new, weakened notion of almost UC realizing a functionality, that is still sufficient for proving composed protocols to be fully\r\nUC-secure.",

    "abstract": "An important part in proving machine computation is to prove the correctness of the read and write operations performed from the memory, which we term memory-proving. Previous methodologies required proving Merkle Tree openings or multi-set hashes, resulting in relatively large proof circuits. We construct an efficient memory-proving Incrementally Verifiable Computation (IVC) scheme from accumulation, which is particularly useful for machine computations with large memories and deterministic steps. In our scheme, the IVC prover PIVC has cost entirely independent of the memory size T and only needs to commit to approximately 15 field elements per read/write operation, marking a more than 100X improvement over prior work. We further reduce this cost by employing a modified, accumulation-friendly version of the GKR protocol. In the optimized version, PIVC only needs to commit to 6 small memory-table elements per read/write. If the table stores 32-bit values, then this is equivalent to committing to less than one single field element per read and write. Our modified GKR protocol is also valuable for proving other deterministic computations within the context of IVC. Our memory-proving protocol can be extended to support key-value store.",

    "abstract": "Asynchronous complete secret sharing (ACSS) is a foundational primitive in the design of distributed algorithms and cryptosystems that require secrecy. Dual-threshold ACSS permits a dealer to distribute a secret to a collection of $n$ servers so that everyone holds shares of a polynomial containing the dealer's secret.\r\n\r\nThis work contributes a new ACSS protocol, called Haven++, that uses packing and batching to make asymptotic and concrete advances in the design and application of ACSS for large secrets. Haven++ allows the dealer to pack multiple secrets in a single sharing phase, and to reconstruct either one or all of them later. For even larger secrets, we contribute a batching technique to amortize the cost of proof generation and verification across multiple invocations of our protocol.\r\n\r\nThe result is an asymptotic improvement in amortized communication and computation complexity, both for ACSS itself and for its application to asynchronous distributed key generation. We implement Haven++ and find that it improves performance over the hbACSS protocol of Yurek et al. by a factor of  3-10$\\times$ or more across a wide range of parameters for the number of parties and batch size.",

    "abstract": "This work initiates the study of concrete registered functional encryption (Reg-FE) beyond ``all-or-nothing'' functionalities:\r\n\r\n   - We build the first Reg-FE for linear function or inner-product evaluation (Reg-IPFE) from pairings. The scheme achieves adaptive IND-security under $k$-Lin assumption in the prime-order bilinear group. A minor modification yields the first Registered Inner-Product Encryption (Reg-IPE) scheme from $k$-Lin assumption. Prior work achieves the same security in the generic group model.\r\n   -We build the first Reg-FE for quadratic function (Reg-QFE) from pairings. The scheme achieves very selective simulation-based security (SIM-security) under bilateral $k$-Lin assumption in the prime-order bilinear group. Here, ``very selective'' means that the adversary claims challenge messages, all quadratic functions to be registered and all corrupted users at the beginning. \r\n\r\nBesides focusing on the compactness of the master public key and helper keys, we also aim for compact ciphertexts in Reg-FE.\r\nLet $L$ be the number of slots and $n$ be the input size. Our first Reg-IPFE has weakly compact ciphertexts of size $O(n\\cdot\\log L)$ while our second Reg-QFE has compact ciphertexts of size $O(n+\\log L)$. Technically, for our first Reg-IPFE, we employ nested dual-system method within the context of Reg-IPFE; for our second Reg-QFE, we follow Wee's ``IPFE-to-QFE'' transformation [TCC' 20] but devise a set of new techniques that make our pairing-based Reg-IPFE compatible. \r\nAlong the way, we introduce a new notion named Pre-Constrained Registered IPFE which generalizes slotted Reg-IPFE by constraining the form of functions that can be registered.",

    "abstract": "Attribute-based cryptography allows fine-grained control on the use of the private key. In particular, attribute-based signature (ABS) specifies the capabilities of the signer, which can only sign messages associated to a policy that is authorized by his set of attributes. Furthermore, we can expect signature to not leak any information about the identity of the signer. ABS is a useful tool for identity-preserving authentication process which requires granular access-control, and can furthermore be enhanced with additional properties, for example delegation where users are able to manage a set of keys derived from their original one.\r\n\r\n  In this paper, we address delegation of signing keys. Our first delegation works for any subset of the original attributes, which is the intuitive approach of delegation. Furthermore, we also provide another kind of delegation where the delegator can choose a policy at delegation time to produce keys that can sign any message under this specific policy. This last approach to delegation is a direct application of a new version of the indexing technique, which was first introduced by Okamoto and Takashima in order to prove adaptive security in ABS and its counterpart for encryption, ABE. \r\n  On top of that, we prove that our scheme is compatible with a well studied feature of ABS, traceability, by using an approach based on Linearly-Homomorphic signatures. \r\n  All our schemes also guarantee the anonymity of the real signer. \r\n  \r\n  The unforgeability of our schemes is proven using the SXDH assumption, and our constructions use the Dual Pairing Vector Spaces (DPVS) framework developed by Okamoto and Takashima, which has been widely used for all kind of attribute and functional cryptography mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Traditional private set intersection (PSI) involves a receiver and a sender holding sets $X$ and $Y$, respectively, with the receiver learning only the intersection $X\\cap Y$.\r\nWe turn our attention to its fuzzy variant, where the receiver holds \\(|X|\\) hyperballs of radius \\(\\delta\\) in a metric space and the sender has $|Y|$ points.  \r\nRepresenting the hyperballs by their center, the receiver learns the points $x\\in X$ for which there exists $y\\in Y$ such that $\\mathsf{dist}(x,y)\\leq \\delta$ with respect to some distance metric.\r\nPrevious approaches either require general-purpose multi-party computation (MPC) techniques like garbled circuits or fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), leak details about the sender\u2019s precise inputs, support limited distance metrics, or scale poorly with the hyperballs' volume.\r\n\r\nThis work presents the first black-box construction for fuzzy PSI (including other variants such as PSI cardinality, labeled PSI, and circuit PSI), which can handle polynomially large radius and dimension (i.e., a potentially exponentially large volume) in two interaction messages, supporting general \\(L_{p\\in[1,\\infty]}\\) distance, without relying on garbled circuits or FHE. The protocol excels in both asymptotic and concrete efficiency compared to existing works.

    "abstract": "The incentive-compatibility properties of blockchain transaction fee mechanisms have been investigated with passive block producers that are motivated purely by the net rewards earned at the consensus layer. This paper introduces a model of active block producers that have their own private valuations for blocks (representing, for example, additional value derived from the application layer). The block producer surplus in our model can be interpreted as one of the more common colloquial meanings of the phrase ``maximal extractable value (MEV).''\r\n\r\nWe first prove that transaction fee mechanism design is fundamentally more difficult with active block producers than with passive ones: With active block producers, no non-trivial or approximately welfare maximizing transaction fee mechanism can be incentive-compatible for both users and block producers. These impossibility results can be interpreted as a mathematical justification for augmenting transaction fee mechanisms with additional components such as orderflow auctions, block producer competition, trusted hardware, or cryptographic techniques. \r\n\r\nWe then proceed to a more fine-grained model of block production that is inspired by current practice, in which we distinguish the roles of ``searchers'' (who actively identify opportunities for value extraction from the application layer and compete for the right to take advantage of them) and ``proposers'' (who participate directly in the blockchain protocol and make the final choice of the published block). Searchers can effectively act as an ``MEV oracle'' for a transaction fee mechanism, thereby enlarging the design space.  Here, we first consider a transaction fee mechanism that resembles how searchers have traditionally been incorporated into the block production process, with each transaction effectively sold off to a searcher through a first-price auction.  We then explore the design space with searchers more generally, and design a mechanism that circumvents our impossibility results for mechanisms without searchers. Our mechanism (the ``SAKA'' mechanism) is deterministic, incentive-compatible (for users, searchers, and the block producer), and sybil-proof, and it guarantees roughly 50% of the maximum-possible welfare when transaction sizes are small relative to block sizes.  We conclude with a matching negative result: even when transactions are small relative to blocks, no incentive-compatible, sybil proof, and deterministic transaction fee mechanism can guarantee more than 50% of the maximum-possible welfare.",

A leakage-tolerant circuit achieves the stronger guarantee that even when $x$ and $y$ are not protected by any encoding, the output of $L$ can be simulated by applying some $L'\\in \\cal L$ to $x$ and $y$ alone. Thus, $C$ is as secure as an ideal hardware implementation of $f$ with respect to leakage from $\\cal L$.\r\n\r\nLeakage-resilient circuits were constructed for low-complexity classes $\\cal L$, including (length-$t$ output) $\\mathcal{AC}0$ functions, parities, and functions with bounded communication complexity. In contrast, leakage-tolerant circuits were only known for the simple case of probing leakage, where $L$ outputs the values of $t$ wires in $C$. \r\n\r\nWe initiate a systematic study of leakage-tolerant circuits for natural classes $\\cal L$ of global leakage functions, obtaining the following main results.\r\n\r\n$\\textbf{Leakage-tolerant circuits for depth-1 leakage.}$  Every circuit $C_f$ for $f$ can be efficiently compiled into an $\\cal L$-tolerant circuit $C$ for $f$, where $\\cal L$ includes all leakage functions $L$ that output either $t$ parities or $t$ disjunctions (alternatively, conjunctions) of any number of wires or their negations. In the case of parities, our simulator runs in $2^{O(t)}$ time. We provide partial evidence that this may be inherent.\r\n\r\n$\\textbf{Application to stateful leakage-resilient circuits.}$ We present a general transformation from (stateless) leakage-tolerant circuits to stateful leakage-resilient circuits. Using this transformation, we obtain the first constructions of stateful $t$-leakage-resilient circuits that tolerate a continuous parity/disjunction/conjunction leakage in which the circuit size grows sub-quadratically with $t$. Interestingly, here we can obtain $\\mathtt{poly}(t)$-time simulation even in the case of parities.",

    "abstract": "DME is a multivariate scheme submitted to the call for additional signatures recently launched by NIST. Its performance is one of the best among all the candidates. The public key is constructed from the alternation of very structured linear and non-linear components that constitute the private key, the latter being defined over an extension field. We exploit these structures by proposing an algebraic attack which is practical on all DME parameters.",

    "abstract": "The (parallel) classical black pebbling game is a helpful abstraction which allows us to analyze the resources (time, space, space-time, cumulative space) necessary to evaluate a function $f$ with a static data-dependency graph $G$ on a (parallel) computer. In particular, the parallel black pebbling game has been used as a tool to quantify the (in)security of Data-Independent Memory-Hard Functions (iMHFs). However, the classical black pebbling game is not suitable to analyze the cost of quantum preimage attack. Thus, Blocki et al. (TCC 2022) introduced the parallel reversible pebbling game as a tool to analyze resource requirements for a quantum computer. While there is an extensive line of work analyzing pebbling complexity in the (parallel) black pebbling game, comparatively little is known about the parallel reversible pebbling game. Our first result is a lower bound of $\\Omega\\left(N^{1+\\sqrt{\\frac{ 2-o(1)}{\\log N}}} \\right)$ on the reversible cumulative pebbling cost for a line graph on $N$ nodes. This yields a separation between classical and reversible pebbling costs demonstrating that the reversibility constraint can increase cumulative pebbling costs (and space-time costs) by a multiplicative factor of $N^{(\\sqrt 2 + o(1))/\\sqrt{\\log N}}$ --- the classical pebbling cost (space-time or cumulative) for a line graph is just $\\mathcal{O}(N)$. On the positive side, we prove that any classical parallel pebbling can be transformed into a reversible pebbling strategy whilst increasing space-time (resp. cumulative memory) costs by a multiplicative factor of at most $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{\\sqrt{\\frac{8}{\\log N}}}\\right)$ (resp. $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{\\mathcal{O}(1)/\\sqrt[4]{\\log N}}\\right)$). We also analyze the impact of the reversibility constraint on the cumulative pebbling cost of depth-robust and depth-reducible DAGs exploiting reversibility to improve constant factors in a prior lower bound of Alwen et al. (EUROCRYPT 2017). For depth-reducible DAGs we show that the state-of-the-art recursive pebbling techniques of Alwen et al. (EUROCRYPT 2017) can be converted into a recursive reversible pebbling attack without any asymptotic increases in pebbling costs. Finally, we extend a result of Blocki et al. (ITCS 2020) to show that it is Unique Games hard to approximate the reversible cumulative pebbling cost of a DAG $G$ to within any constant factor.",

    "abstract": "Non-malleable codes are fundamental objects at the intersection of cryptography and coding theory. These codes provide security guarantees even in settings where error correction and detection are impossible, and have found applications to several other cryptographic tasks. One of the strongest and most well-studied adversarial tampering models is $2$-split-state tampering. Here, a codeword is split into two parts which are stored in physically distant servers, and the adversary can then independently tamper with each part using arbitrary functions. This model can be naturally extended to the secret sharing setting with several parties by having the adversary independently tamper with each share. Previous works on non-malleable coding and secret sharing in the split-state tampering model only considered the encoding of classical messages. Furthermore, until recent work by Aggarwal, Boddu, and Jain (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2024 & arXiv 2022), adversaries with quantum capabilities and shared entanglement had not been considered, and it is a priori not clear whether previous schemes remain secure in this model.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we introduce the notions of split-state non-malleable codes and secret sharing schemes for quantum messages secure against quantum adversaries with shared entanglement. Then, we present explicit constructions of such schemes that achieve low-error non-malleability. More precisely, we construct efficiently encodable and decodable split-state non-malleable codes and secret sharing schemes for quantum messages preserving entanglement with external systems and achieving security against quantum adversaries having shared entanglement with codeword length $n$, any message length at most $n^{\\Omega(1)}$, and error $\\varepsilon=2^{-{n^{\\Omega(1)}}}$. In the easier setting of average-case non-malleability, we achieve efficient non-malleable coding with rate close to $1/11$.",

    "abstract": "Incremental Verifiable Computation (IVC) allows a prover to prove to a verifier the correct execution of a sequential computation. Recent works focus on improving the universality and efficiency of IVC Schemes, which can be categorized into Accumulation and Folding-based IVCs with Folding-based ones being more efficient (due to their deferred proof generation until the final step). Unfortunately, both approaches satisfy only heuristic security as they model the Random Oracle (RO) as a circuit in their non-constant depth recursive composition of the base Scheme. Such drawback is two-fold: to connect the consecutive execution step the RO is recursively modeled as a circuit during the folding or the accumulating process, and again in the final SNARK wrapper circuit (a common practice in Folding-based IVCs).  \r\n\r\nWe revisit this problem, with a focus on the Folding-based IVCs due to their efficiency, and propose the detachment of RO invocation from the folding circuit. We can instead accumulate such invocations, yielding the so-called Conditional Folding (CF) Scheme to overcome the first drawback. One can consider our CF Scheme a hybrid Folding-Accumulation Scheme with provable security. We provide a non-trivial practical construction for our CF scheme that is natively parallelizable, which offers great efficiency. We rigorously prove the security of our CF scheme (also for the case of folding in parallel; and our scheme can be made non-interactive using Fiat-Shamir). Our CF scheme is generic and does not require trusted setup. It can be adapted to construct the first IVC for RAM programs, i.e. Parallelizable Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge for RAM Programs that we dub RAMenPaSTA, that can be used to build zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs). Both our CF Scheme and RAMenPaSTA can be of independent research interests.",

    "abstract": "The Tensor Isomorphism Problem (TIP) has been shown to be equivalent to the matrix code equivalence problem, making it an interesting candidate on which to build post-quantum cryptographic primitives. These hard problems have already been used in protocol development. One of these, MEDS, is currently in Round 1 of NIST's call for additional post-quantum digital signatures.\r\n    In this work, we consider the TIP for a special class of tensors. The hardness of the decisional version of this problem is the foundation of a commitment scheme proposed by D'Alconzo, Flamini, and Gangemi (Asiacrypt 2023). We present polynomial-time algorithms for the decisional and computational versions of TIP for special orbits, which implies that the commitment scheme is not secure. The key observations of these algorithms are that these special tensors contain some low-rank points, and their stabilizer groups are not trivial.\r\n    With these new developments in the security of TIP in mind, we give a new commitment scheme based on the general TIP that is non-interactive, post-quantum, and statistically binding, making no new assumptions. Such a commitment scheme does not currently exist in the literature.",

    "abstract": "The XOR of two independent permutations (XoP) is a well-known construction for achieving security beyond the birthday bound when implementing a pseudorandom function using a block cipher (i.e., a pseudorandom permutation). The idealized construction (where the permutations are uniformly chosen and independent) and its variants have been extensively analyzed over nearly 25 years.\r\n \r\nThe best-known asymptotic information-theoretic indistinguishability bound for the XoP construction is $O(q/2^{1.5n})$, derived by Eberhard in 2017, where $q$ is the number of queries and $n$ is the block length.\r\n\r\nA generalization of the XoP construction outputs the XOR of $r \\geq 2$ independent permutations, and has also received significant attention in both the single-user and multi-user settings. In particular, for $r = 3$, the best-known bound (obtained by Choi et al. [ASIACRYPT'22]) is about $q^2/2^{2.5 n}$ in the single-user setting and $\\sqrt{u} q_{\\max}^2/2^{2.5 n}$ in the multi-user setting (where $u$ is the number of users and $q_{\\max}$ is the number of queries per user).\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we prove an indistinguishability bound of $q/2^{(r - 0.5)n}$ for the (generalized) XoP construction in the single-user setting, and a bound of $\\sqrt{u} q_{\\max}/2^{(r - 0.5)n}$ in the multi-user setting. In particular, for $r=2$, we obtain the bounds $q/2^{1.5n}$ and $\\sqrt{u} q_{\\max}/2^{1.5n}$ in single-user and multi-user settings, respectively. For $r=3$ the corresponding bounds are $q/2^{2.5n}$ and $\\sqrt{u} q_{\\max}/2^{2.5n}$. All of these bounds hold assuming $q < 2^{n}/2$ (or $q_{\\max} < 2^{n}/2$).\r\n\r\nCompared to previous works, we improve all the best-known bounds for the (generalized) XoP construction in the multi-user setting, and the best-known bounds for the generalized XoP construction for $r \\geq 3$ in the single-user setting (assuming $q \\geq 2^{n/2}$). For the basic two-permutation XoP construction in the single-user setting, our concrete bound of $q/2^{1.5n}$ stands in contrast to the asymptotic bound of $O(q/2^{1.5n})$ by Eberhard. \r\n\r\nSince all of our bounds are matched (up to constant factors) for $q \\geq 2^{n/2}$ by attacks published by Patarin in 2008 (and their generalizations to the multi-user setting), they are all tight. \r\n \r\nWe obtain our results by Fourier analysis of Boolean functions. Most of our technical work involves bounding (sums of) Fourier coefficients of the density function associated  with sampling without replacement. While the proof of Eberhard relies on similar bounds, our proof is elementary and simpler.",

    "abstract": "Side channel attacks are devastating attacks targeting cryptographic implementations. To protect against these attacks, various countermeasures have been proposed -- in particular, the so-called masking scheme. Masking schemes work by hiding sensitive information via secret sharing all intermediate values that occur during the evaluation of a cryptographic implementation. Over the last decade, there has been broad interest in designing and formally analyzing such schemes. The random probing model considers leakage where the value on each wire leaks with some probability $\\epsilon$. This model is important as it implies security in the noisy leakage model via a reduction by Duc et al. (Eurocrypt 2014). Noisy leakages are considered the \"gold-standard\" for analyzing masking schemes as they accurately model many real-world physical leakages. Unfortunately, the reduction of Duc et al. is non-tight, and in particular requires that the amount of noise increases by a factor of $|\\mathbb{F}|$ for circuits that operate over $\\mathbb{F}$ (where $\\mathbb{F}$ is a finite field). In this work, we give a generic transformation from  random probing to average probing, which avoids this loss of $|\\mathbb{F}|$. Since the average probing is identical to the noisy leakage model (Eurocrypt 2014), this yields for the first time a security analysis of masked circuits where the noise parameter $\\delta$ in the noisy leakage model is independent of $|\\mathbb{F}|$. The latter is particularly important for cryptographic schemes operating over large fields, e.g., the AES or the recently standardized post-quantum schemes.",

    "abstract": "We present VeriSimplePIR, a verifiable version of the state-of-the-art semi-honest SimplePIR protocol. VeriSimplePIR is a stateful verifiable PIR scheme guaranteeing that all queries are consistent with a fixed, well-formed database. It is the first efficient verifiable PIR scheme to not rely on an honest digest to ensure security; any digest, even one produced by a malicious server, is sufficient to commit to some database. This is due to our extractable verification procedure, which can extract the entire database from the consistency proof checked against each response. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, VeriSimplePIR ensures this strong security guarantee without compromising the performance of SimplePIR. The online communication overhead is roughly $1.1$-$1.5\\times$ SimplePIR, and the online computation time on the server is essentially the same. We achieve this low overhead via a novel one-time preprocessing protocol that generates a reusable proof that can verify any number of subsequent query-response pairs as long as no malicious behavior is detected. As soon as the verification procedure rejects a response from the server, the offline phase must be rerun to compute a new proof. VeriSimplePIR represents an approach to maliciously secure cryptography that is highly optimized for honest parties while maintaining security even in the presence of malicious adversaries.",

    "abstract": "The cube attack extracts the information of secret key bits by recovering the coefficient called superpoly in the output bit with respect to a subset of plaintexts/IV, which is called a cube. While the division property provides an efficient way to detect the structure of the superpoly, superpoly recovery could still be prohibitively costly if the number of rounds is sufficiently high. In particular, Core Monomial Prediction (CMP) was proposed at ASIACRYPT 2022 as a scaled-down version of Monomial Prediction (MP), which sacrifices accuracy for efficiency but ultimately gets stuck at 848 rounds of \\trivium. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we provide new insights into CMP by elucidating the algebraic meaning to the core monomial trails. We prove that it is sufficient to recover the superpoly by extracting all the core monomial trails, an approach based solely on CMP, thus demonstrating that CMP can achieve perfect accuracy as MP does. We further reveal that CMP is still MP in essence, but with variable substitutions on the target function. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer strategy that has been widely used in previous literature, we design a meet-in-the-middle (MITM) framework, in which the CMP-based approach can be embedded to achieve a speedup.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the power of these new techniques, we apply the MITM framework to \\trivium, \\grain and \\kreyvium. As a result, not only can the previous computational cost of superpoly recovery be reduced (e.g., 5x faster for superpoly recovery on 192-round \\grain), but we also succeed in recovering superpolies for up to 851 rounds of \\trivium and up to 899 rounds of \\kreyvium. This surpasses the previous best results by respectively 3 and 4 rounds. Using the memory-efficient M\\\"obius transform proposed at EUROCRYPT 2021, we can perform key recovery attacks on target ciphers, even though the superpoly may contain over $2^{40}$ monomials. This leads to the best cube attacks on the target ciphers.",

    "abstract": "Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) is a trend in applied cryptography because it combine confidentiality, integrity, and authentication into one algorithm and is more efficient than using block ciphers and hash functions separately. The Ascon algorithm, as the winner in both the CAESAR competition and the NIST LwC competition, will soon become the AEAD standard for protecting the Internet of Things and micro devices with limited computing resources. We propose a partial differential fault analysis (PDFA) technology for the Ascon algorithm, using stuck-at fault and random-nibble fault models respectively. Theoretically, after 9.9 full-round fault injections or 263 single nibble fault injections, 128-bit key can be completely recovered. In addition, we conducted the first discussion of this analysis method under different nonce configurations. In the Nonce-respect case, an average of 130 additional Tag queries are required to complete the guessing of the faulty tag, afterwards equating this case with the Nonce-misuse case. Subsequent experimental results proved the correctness of the theoretical model. Finally we discuss some countermeasures against proposed attacks, and we propose a new S-box that can be used to replace the existing S-box in ASCON to render PDFA ineffective.",

    "abstract": "In differential-like attacks, the process typically involves extending a distinguisher forward and backward with probability 1 for some rounds and recovering the key involved in the extended part. Particularly in rectangle attacks, a holistic key recovery strategy can be employed to yield the most efficient attacks tailored to a given distinguisher. In this paper, we treat the distinguisher and the extended part as an integrated entity and give a one-step framework for finding rectangle attacks with the purpose of reducing the overall complexity or attacking more rounds. In this framework, we propose to allow probabilistic differential propagations in the extended part and incorporate the holistic recovery strategy. Additionally, we introduce the ``split-and-bunch technique'' to further reduce the time complexity. Beyond rectangle attacks, we extend these foundational concepts to encompass differential attacks as well. To demonstrate the efficiency of our framework, we apply it to Deoxys-BC-384, SKINNY, ForkSkinny, and CRAFT,  achieving a series of refined and improved rectangle attacks and differential attacks. Notably, we obtain the first 15-round attack on Deoxys-BC-384, narrowing its security margin to only one round. Furthermore, our differential attack on CRAFT extends to 23 rounds, covering two more rounds than the previous best attacks.",

    "abstract": "At EUROCRYPT\u201923, Castryck and Decru, Maino et al., and Robert present efficient attacks against supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol (SIDH). Drawing inspiration from these attacks, Andrea Basso, Luciano Maino, and Giacomo Pope introduce FESTA, an isogeny-based trapdoor function, along with a corresponding IND-CCA secure public key encryption (PKE) protocol at ASIACRYPT\u201923. FESTA incorporates either a diagonal or circulant matrix into the secret key to mask torsion points.\r\nIn this paper, we employ a side-channel attack to construct an auxiliary verification oracle. By querying this oracle, we propose an adaptive attack strategy to recover the secret key in FESTA when the secret matrix is circulant. Compared with existing attacks, our strategy is more efficient and formal. Leveraging these findings, we implement our attack algorithms to recover the circulant matrix in secret key. Finally, we demonstrate that if the secret matrix is circulant, then the adversary can successfully recover FESTA\u2019s secret key with a polynomial number of decryption machine queries. Consequently, our paper illustrates that FESTA PKE protocol with secret circulant matrix does not achieve IND-CCA security.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new type of algebraic attack that applies to many recent arithmetization-oriented families of permutations, such as those used in Griffin, Anemoi, ArionHash, and XHash8, whose security relies on the hardness of the constrained-input constrained-output (CICO) problem. We introduce the FreeLunch approach: the monomial ordering is chosen so that the natural polynomial system encoding the CICO problem already is a Gr\u00f6bner basis. In addition, we present a new dedicated resolution algorithm for FreeLunch systems of complexity lower than applicable state-of-the-art FGLM algorithms. \r\nWe show that the FreeLunch approach challenges the security of fullround instances of Anemoi, Arion and Griffin. We confirm these theoretical results with experimental results on those three permutations. In particular, using the FreeLunch attack combined with a new technique to bypass 3 rounds of Griffin, we recover a CICO solution for 7 out of 10 rounds of Griffin in less than four hours on one core of AMD EPYC 7352 (2.3GHz).",

    "abstract": "Nonlocal games are a foundational tool for understanding entanglement and constructing quantum protocols in settings with multiple spatially separated quantum devices. In this work, we continue the study initiated by Kalai et al. (STOC '23) of compiled nonlocal games, played between a classical verifier and a single cryptographically limited quantum device. Our main result is that the compiler proposed by Kalai et al. is sound for any two-player XOR game. A celebrated theorem of Tsirelson shows that for XOR games, the quantum value is exactly given by a semidefinite program, and we obtain our result by showing that the SDP upper bound holds for the compiled game up to a negligible error arising from the compilation. This answers a question raised by Natarajan and Zhang (FOCS '23), who showed soundness for the specific case of the CHSH game. Using our techniques, we obtain several additional results, including (1) tight bounds on the compiled value of parallel-repeated XOR games, (2) operator self-testing statements for any compiled XOR game, and (3) a ``nice\" sum-of-squares certificate for any XOR game, from which operator rigidity is manifest.",

    "abstract": "The SHA-2 family including SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384,\r\nSHA-512, SHA-512/224 and SHA512/256 is a U.S. federal standard pub-\r\nlished by NIST. Especially, there is no doubt that SHA-256 is one of the\r\nmost important hash functions used in real-world applications. Due to\r\nits complex design compared with SHA-1, there is almost no progress\r\nin collision attacks on SHA-2 after ASIACRYPT 2015. In this work, we\r\nretake this challenge and aim to significantly improve collision attacks\r\non the SHA-2 family. First, we observe from many existing attacks on\r\nSHA-2 that the current advanced tool to search for SHA-2 characteristics\r\nhas reached the bottleneck. Specifically, longer differential characteristics\r\ncould not be found, and this causes that the collision attack could not\r\nreach more steps. To address this issue, we adopt Liu et al.\u2019s MILP-based\r\nmethod and implement it with SAT/SMT for SHA-2, where we also add\r\nmore techniques to detect contradictions in SHA-2 characteristics. This\r\nanswers an open problem left in Liu et al.\u2019s paper to apply the technique\r\nto SHA-2. With this SAT/SMT-based tool, we search for SHA-2 charac-\r\nteristics by controlling its sparsity in a dedicated way. As a result, we\r\nsuccessfully find the first practical semi-free-start (SFS) colliding message\r\npair for 39-step SHA-256, improving the best 38-step SFS collision attack\r\npublished at EUROCRYPT 2013. In addition, we also report the first\r\npractical free-start (FS) collision attack on 40-step SHA-224, while the\r\npreviously best theoretic 40-step attack has time complexity 2110. More-\r\nover, for the first time, we can mount practical and theoretic collision\r\nattacks on 28-step and 31-step SHA-512, respectively, which improve the\r\nbest collision attack only reaching 27 steps of SHA-512 at ASIACRYPT\r\n2015. In a word, with new techniques to find SHA-2 characteristics, we\r\nhave made some notable progress in the analysis of SHA-2 after the major\r\nachievements made at EUROCRYPT 2013 and ASIACRYPT 2015.",

    "abstract": "As an ISO/IEC standard, the hash function RIPEMD-160 has been used to generate the Bitcoin address with SHA-256. However, due to the complex double-branch structure of RIPEMD-160, the best collision attack only reaches 36 out of 80 steps of RIPEMD-160, and the best semi-free-start (SFS) collision attack only reaches 40 steps. To improve the 36-step collision attack proposed at EUROCRYPT 2023, we explored the possibility of using different message differences to increase the number of attacked steps, and we finally identified one choice allowing a 40-step collision attack. To find the corresponding 40-step differential characteristic, we re-implement the MILP-based method to search for signed differential characteristics with SAT/SMT. As a result, we can find a colliding message pair for 40-step RIPEMD-160 in practical time, which significantly improves the best collision attack on RIPEMD-160. For the best SFS collision attack published at ToSC 2019, we observe that the bottleneck is the probability of the right-branch differential characteristics as they are fully uncontrolled in the message modification. To address this issue, we utilize our SAT/SMT-based tool to search for high-probability differential characteristics for the right branch. Consequently, we can mount successful SFS collision attacks on 41, 42 and 43 steps of RIPEMD-160, thus significantly improving the SFS collision attacks. In addition, we also searched for a 44-step differential characteristic, but the differential probability is too low to allow a meaningful SFS collision attack.",

    "abstract": "The Nostradamus attack was originally proposed as a security vulnerability for a hash function by Kelsey and Kohno at EUROCRYPT 2006. It requires the attacker to commit to a hash value y of an iterated hash function H. Subsequently, upon being provided with a message prefix P, the adversary\u2019s task is to identify a suffix S such that H(P||S) equals y. Kelsey and Kohno demonstrated a herding attack requiring $O(\\sqrt{n}\\cdot 2^{2n/3})$ evaluations of the compression function of H, where n represents the output and state size of the hash, placing this attack between preimage attacks and collision searches in terms of complexity. At ASIACRYPT 2022, Benedikt et al. transform Kelsey and Kohno\u2019s attack into a quantum variant, decreasing the time complexity from $O(\\sqrt{n}\\cdot 2^{2n/3})$ to $O(\\sqrt[3]{n}\\cdot 2^{3n/7})$. At ToSC 2023, Zhang et al. proposed the first dedicated Nostradamus attack on AES-like hashing in both classical and quantum settings. In this paper, we have made revisions to the multi-target technique incorporated into the meet-in-the-middle automatic search framework. This modification leads to a decrease in time complexity during the online linking phase, effectively reducing the overall attack time complexity in both classical and quantum scenarios. Specifically, we can achieve more rounds in the classical setting and reduce the time complexity for the same round in the quantum setting.",

    "abstract": "FuLeeca is a signature scheme submitted to the recent NIST call for additional signatures. It is an efficient hash-and-sign scheme based on quasi-cyclic codes in the Lee metric and resembles the lattice-based signature Falcon. FuLeeca proposes a so-called concentration step within the signing procedure to avoid leakage of secret-key information from the signatures. However, FuLeeca is still vulnerable to learning attacks, which were first observed for lattice-based schemes. We present three full key-recovery attacks by exploiting the proximity of the code-based FuLeeca scheme to lattice-based primitives.\r\nMore precisely, we use a few signatures to extract an $n/2$-dimensional circulant sublattice from the given length-$n$ code, that still contains the exceptionally short secret-key vector. This significantly reduces the classical attack cost and, in addition, leads to a full key recovery in quantum-polynomial time. Furthermore, we exploit a bias in the concentration procedure to classically recover the full key for any security level with at most 175,000 signatures in less than an hour.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the first adaptively secure streaming functional encryption (sFE) scheme for P/Poly. sFE stands as an evolved variant of traditional functional encryption (FE), catering specifically to contexts with vast and/or dynamically evolving data sets. sFE is designed for applications where data arrives in a streaming fashion and is computed on in an iterative manner as the stream arrives. Unlike standard FE, in sFE: (1) encryption is possible without knowledge of the full data set, (2) partial decryption is possible given only a prefix of the input. \r\nGuan, Korb, and Sahai introduced this concept in their recent publication [CRYPTO 2023], where they constructed an sFE scheme for P/Poly using a compact standard FE scheme for the same. However, their sFE scheme only achieved semi-adaptive-function-selective security, which constrains the adversary to obtain all functional keys prior to seeing any ciphertext for the challenge stream. This limitation severely limits the scenarios where sFE can be applied, and therefore fails to provide a suitable theoretical basis for sFE. \r\nIn contrast, the adaptive security model empowers the adversary to arbitrarily interleave requests for functional keys with ciphertexts related to the challenge stream. Guan, Korb, and Sahai identified achieving adaptive security for sFE as the key question left open by their work.\r\nWe resolve this open question positively by constructing an adaptively secure sFE construction from indistinguishability obfuscation for P/Poly and injective PRGs. By combining our work with that of Jain, Lin, and Sahai [STOC 2021, EUROCRYPT 2022], we obtain the first adaptively secure sFE scheme for P/Poly based on sub-exponential hardness of well-studied computational problems",

    "abstract": "Recent work has introduced the \"Quantum-Computation Classical-Communication\"\r\n(QCCC) (Chung et. al.) setting for cryptography. There has been some evidence that\r\nOne Way Puzzles (OWPuzz) are the natural central cryptographic primitive for this\r\nsetting (Khurana and Tomer). For a primitive to be considered central it should\r\nhave several characteristics. It should be well behaved (which for this paper we will\r\nthink of as having amplification, combiners, and universal constructions); it should\r\nbe implied by a wide variety of other primitives; and it should be equivalent to some\r\nclass of useful primitives. We present combiners, correctness and security amplifica-\r\ntion, and a universal construction for OWPuzz. Our proof of security amplification\r\nuses a new and cleaner version construction of EFI from OWPuzz (in comparison to\r\nthe result of Khurana and Tomer) that generalizes to weak OWPuzz and is the most\r\ntechnically involved section of the paper. It was previously known that OWPuzz are\r\nimplied by other primitives of interest including commitments, symmetric key encryp-\r\ntion, one way state generators (OWSG), and therefore pseudorandom states (PRS).\r\nHowever we are able to rule out OWPuzz\u2019s equivalence to many of these primitives\r\nby showing a black box separation between general OWPuzz and a restricted class\r\nof OWPuzz (those with efficient verification, which we call EV \u2212 OWPuzz). We then\r\nshow that EV \u2212 OWPuzz are also implied by most of these primitives, which separates\r\nthem from OWPuzz as well. This separation also separates extending PRS from highly\r\ncompressing PRS answering an open question of Ananth et. al.",

    "abstract": "The iMessage PQ3 protocol is an end-to-end encrypted messaging protocol designed for exchanging data in long-lived sessions between two devices. It aims to provide classical and post-quantum confidentiality for forward secrecy and post-compromise secrecy, as well as classical authentication. Its initial authenticated key exchange is constructed from digital signatures plus elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman and post-quantum key exchanges; to derive per-message keys on an ongoing basis, it employs an adaptation of the Signal double ratchet that includes a post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism. This paper presents the cryptographic details of the PQ3 protocol and gives a reductionist security analysis by adapting the multi-stage key exchange security analysis of Signal by Cohn-Gordon et al. (J. Cryptology, 2020). The analysis shows that PQ3 provides confidentiality with forward secrecy and post-compromise security against both classical and quantum adversaries, in both the initial key exchange as well as the continuous rekeying phase of the protocol.",

    "abstract": "EdDSA, standardized by both IRTF and NIST, is a variant of the well-known Schnorr signature scheme based on Edwards curves, benefitting from stateless and deterministic derivation of nonces (i.e., it does not require a reliable source of randomness or state continuity). Recently, NIST called for multi-party threshold EdDSA signatures in one mode of verifying such nonce derivation via zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs.  However, it is challenging to translate the stateless and deterministic benefits of EdDSA to the multi-party threshold setting, as no fresh randomness is available for signing the same message. In this paper, we present a new stateless and deterministic multi-party EdDSA protocol in the full-threshold setting, tolerating all-but-one malicious corruptions. Compared to the state-of-the-art multi-party EdDSA protocol by Garillot et al. (Crypto'21), we improve the communication cost by a factor of 56x and have the same three rounds, at the cost of increasing the computational cost by about 2.25x. We adopt information-theoretic message authenticated codes (IT-MACs) in the multi-verifier setting to authenticate values, and convert them from a Boolean domain to an arithmetic domain by refining multi-verifier extended doubly-authenticated bits (\\edabits). We adopt pseudorandom correlation function (\\PCF) to generate IT-MACs statelessly and deterministically. Together, we design a multi-verifier zero-knowledge (MVZK) protocol to derive nonces statelessly and deterministically.",

    "abstract": "Collision-resistant hashing, a fundamental primitive in modern cryptography, ensures that there is no efficient way to find distinct inputs that produce the same hash value. This property underpins the security of various cryptographic applications, making it crucial to understand its complexity. The complexity of this problem is well-understood in the classical setting and $\\Theta(N^{1/2})$ queries are needed to find a collision. However, the advent of quantum computing has introduced new challenges since quantum adversaries - equipped with the power of quantum queries - can find collisions much more efficiently. Brassard, H\u00f6yer and Tapp and Aaronson and Shi established that full-scale quantum adversaries require $\\Theta(N^{1/3})$ queries to find a collision, prompting a need for longer hash outputs, which impacts efficiency in terms of the key lengths needed for security.\r\n\r\nThis paper explores the implications of quantum attacks in the Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. In this work, we investigate three different models for NISQ algorithms and achieve tight bounds for all of them:\r\n  (1) A hybrid algorithm making adaptive quantum or classical queries but with a limited quantum query budget, or\r\n  (2) A quantum algorithm with access to a noisy oracle, subject to a dephasing or depolarizing channel, or\r\n  (3) A hybrid algorithm with an upper bound on its maximum quantum depth; i.e., a classical algorithm aided by low-depth quantum circuits.\r\n\r\nIn fact, our results handle all regimes between NISQ and full-scale quantum computers. Previously, only results for the pre-image search problem were known for these models by Sun and Zheng, Rosmanis, Chen, Cotler, Huang and Li while nothing was known about the collision finding problem.\r\n\r\nAlong with our main results, we develop an information-theoretic framework for recording query transcripts of quantum-classical algorithms. The main feature of this framework is that it allows us to record queries in two incompatible bases - classical queries in the standard basis and quantum queries in the Fourier basis - consistently. We call the framework the hybrid compressed oracle as it naturally interpolates between the classical way of recording queries and the compressed oracle framework of Zhandry for recording quantum queries.",

    "abstract": "Weak forward secrecy (wFS) of authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocols is a passive variant of (full) forward secrecy (FS). A natural mechanism to upgrade from wFS to FS is the use of key confirmation messages which compute a message authentication code (MAC) over the transcript. Unfortunately, Gellert, Gj\u00f8steen, Jacobson and Jager (GGJJ, CRYPTO 2023) show that this mechanism inherently incurs a loss proportional to the number of users, leading to an overall non-tight reduction, even if wFS was established using a tight reduction. \r\n\r\nInspired by GGJJ, we propose a new notion, called one-way verifiable weak forward secrecy (OW-VwFS), and prove that OW-VwFS can be transformed tightly to FS using key confirmation in the random oracle model (ROM). To implement our generic transformation, we show that several tightly wFS AKE protocols additionally satisfy our OW-VwFS notion tightly. We highlight that using the recent lattice-based protocol from Pan, Wagner, and Zeng (CRYPTO 2023) can give us the first lattice-based tightly FS AKE via key confirmation in the classical random oracle model. Besides this, we also obtain a Decisional-Diffie-Hellman-based protocol that is considerably more efficient than the previous ones.\r\n\r\nFinally, we lift our study on FS via key confirmation to the quantum random oracle model (QROM). While our security reduction is overall non-tight, it matches the best existing bound for wFS in the QROM (Pan, Wagner, and Zeng, ASIACRYPT 2023), namely, it is square-root- and session-tight. Our analysis is in the multi-challenge setting, and it is more realistic than the single-challenge setting as in Pan et al..",

    "abstract": "Causal reasoning plays an important role in the comprehension of communication, but it has been elusive so far how causality should be properly preserved by instant messaging services. To the best of our knowledge, causality preservation is not even treated as a desired security property by most (if not all) existing secure messaging protocols like Signal. This is probably due to the intuition that causality seems already preserved when all received messages are intact and displayed according to their sending order. Our starting point is to notice that this intuition is wrong.\r\n\r\nUntil now, for messaging channels (where conversations take place), both the proper causality model and the provably secure constructions have been left open. Our work fills this gap, with the goal to facilitate the formal understanding of causality preservation in messaging.\r\n\r\nFirst, we focus on the common two-user secure messaging channels and model the desired causality preservation property. We take the popular Signal protocol as an example and analyze the causality security of its cryptographic core (the double-ratchet mechanism). We show its inadequacy with a simple causality attack, then fix it such that the resulting Signal channel is causality-preserving, even in a strong sense that guarantees post-compromise security. Our fix is actually generic: it can be applied to any bidirectional channel to gain strong causality security.\r\n\r\nThen, we model causality security for the so-called message franking channels. Such a channel additionally enables end users to report individual abusive messages to a server (e.g., the service provider), where this server relays the end-to-end-encrypted communication between users. Causality security in this setting further allows the server to retrieve the necessary causal dependencies of each reported message, essentially extending isolated reported messages to message flows. This has great security merit for dispute resolution, because a benign message may be deemed abusive when isolated from the context. As an example, we apply our model to analyze Facebook\u2019s message franking scheme. We show that a malicious user can easily trick Facebook (i.e., the server) to accuse an innocent user. Then we fix this issue by amending the underlying message franking channel to preserve the desired causality.",

    "abstract": "A Bitcoin miner who owns a sufficient amount of mining power can perform selfish mining to increase his relative revenue. Studies have demonstrated that the time-averaged profit of a selfish miner starts to rise once the mining difficulty level gets adjusted in favor of the attacker. Selfish mining profitability lies in the fact that orphan blocks are not incorporated into the current version of Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment mechanism (DAM). Therefore, it is believed that considering the count of orphan blocks in the DAM can result in selfish mining unprofitability. In this paper, we disprove this belief by providing a formal analysis of the selfish mining time-averaged profit. We present a precise definition of the orphan blocks that can be incorporated into calculating the next epoch's target and then introduce two modified versions of DAM in which both main-chain blocks and orphan blocks are incorporated. We propose two versions of smart intermittent selfish mining, where the first one dominates the normal intermittent selfish mining and the second one results in selfish mining profitability under the modified DAMs. Moreover, we present the orphan exclusion attack with the help of which the attacker can stop honest miners from reporting the orphan blocks. Using combinatorial tools, we analyze the profitability of selfish mining accompanied by the orphan exclusion attack under the modified DAMs. Our result shows that even when considering the orphan blocks in the DAM, normal selfish mining can still be profitable; however, the level of profitability under the modified DAMs is significantly lower than that observed under the current version of Bitcoin DAM.",

    "abstract": "The Alternating Trilinear Form Equivalence (ATFE) problem was recently used by Tang et al. as a hardness assumption in the design of a Fiat-Shamir digital signature scheme ALTEQ. The scheme was submitted to the additional round for digital signatures of the NIST standardization process for post-quantum cryptography.   \r\n\r\nATFE is a hard equivalence problem known to be in the class of equivalence problems that includes, for instance, the Tensor Isomorphism (TI), Quadratic Maps Linear Equivalence (QMLE) and the Matrix Code Equivalence (MCE) problems. Due to the increased cryptographic interest, the understanding of its practical hardness has also increased in the last couple of years. Currently, there are several combinatorial and algebraic algorithms for solving it, the best of which is a graph-theoretic algorithm that also includes an algebraic subroutine.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we take a purely algebraic approach to the ATFE problem, but we use a coding theory perspective to model the problem. This modelling was introduced earlier for the MCE problem. Using it, we improve the cost of algebraic attacks against ATFE compared to previously known ones.\r\n\r\nTaking into account the algebraic structure of alternating trilinear forms, we show that the obtained system has less variables but also less equations than for MCE and gives rise to structural degree-3 syzygies. Under the assumption that outside of these syzygies the system behaves semi-regularly, we provide a concrete, non-asymptotic complexity estimate of the performance of our algebraic attack. \r\nOur results show that the complexity of our attack is below the estimated security levels of ALTEQ by more than 20 bits for NIST level I (and more for the others), thus the scheme requires re-parametrization for all three NIST security levels.",

    "abstract": "Physical security is an important aspect of devices for which an adversary can manipulate the physical execution environment. Recently, more and more attention has been directed towards a security model that combines the capabilities of passive and active physical attacks, i.e., an adversary that performs fault-injection and side-channel analysis at the same time. Implementing countermeasures against such a powerful adversary is not only costly but also requires the skillful combination of masking and redundancy to counteract all reciprocal effects. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose a new methodology to generate combined-secure circuits. We show how to transform TI-like constructions to resist any adversary with the capability to tamper with internal gates and probe internal wires. For the resulting protection scheme, we can prove the combined security in a well-established theoretical security model.\r\n\r\nSince the transformation preserves the advantages of TI-like structures, the resulting circuits prove to be more efficient in the number of required bits of randomness (up to 100%), the latency in clock cycles (up to 40%), and even the area for pipelined designs (up to 40%) than the state of the art for an adversary restricted to manipulating a single gate and probing a single wire.",

    "abstract": "The Partial Vandermonde (PV) Knapsack problem is an algebraic variant of the low-density inhomogeneous SIS problem. The problem has been used as a building block for various lattice-based constructions, including signatures (ACNS'14, ACISP'18), encryptions (DCC'15,DCC'20), and signature aggregation (Eprint'20). At Crypto'22, Boudgoust, Gachon, and Pellet-Mary proposed a key distinguishing attack on the PV Knapsack exploiting algebraic properties of the problem. Unfortunately, their attack doesn't offer key recovery, except for worst-case keys. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose an alternative attack on the PV Knapsack problem, which provides key recovery for a much larger set of keys. Like the Crypto'22 attack, it is based on lattice reduction and uses a dimension reduction technique to speed-up the underlying lattice reduction algorithm and enhance its performance. As a side bonus, our attack transforms the PV Knapsack problem into uSVP instances instead of SVP instances in the Crypto'22 attack. This also helps the lattice reduction algorithm, both from a theoretical and practical point of view.\r\n\r\nWe use our attack to re-assess the hardness of the concrete parameters used in the literature. It appears that many contain a non-negligible fraction of weak keys, which are easily identified and extremely susceptible to our attack. For example, a fraction of $2^{-19}$ of the public keys of a parameter set from ACISP'18 can be solved in about $30$ hours on a moderate server using off-the-shelf lattice reduction. This parameter set was initially claimed to have a $129$-bit security against key recovery attack. Its security was reduced to $87$-bit security using the distinguishing attack from Crypto'22. Similarly, the ACNS'14 proposal also includes a parameter set containing a fraction of $2^{-19}$ of weak keys; those can be solved in about $17$ hours.",

    "abstract": "We report on efficient and secure hardware implementation techniques for the FIPS 205 SLH-DSA Hash-Based Signature Standard. We demonstrate that very significant overall performance gains can be obtained from hardware that optimizes the padding formats and iterative hashing processes specific to SLH-DSA. A prototype implementation, SLotH, contains Keccak/SHAKE, SHA2-256, and SHA2-512 cores and supports all 12 parameter sets of SLH-DSA. SLotH also supports side-channel secure PRF computation and Winternitz chains. SLotH drivers run on a small RISC-V control core, as is common in current Root-of-Trust (RoT) systems.\r\n\r\nThe new features make SLH-DSA on SLotH many times faster compared to similarly-sized general-purpose hash accelerators. Compared to unaccelerated microcontroller implementations, the performance of SLotH's SHAKE variants is up to $300\\times$ faster; signature generation with 128f parameter set is is 4,903,978 cycles, while signature verification with 128s parameter set is only 179,603 cycles. The SHA2 parameter sets have approximately half of the speed of SHAKE parameter sets. We observe that the signature verification performance of SLH-DSA's ``s'' parameter sets is generally better than that of accelerated ECDSA or Dilithium on similarly-sized RoT targets. The area of the full SLotH system is small, from 63 kGE (SHA2, Cat 1 only) to 155 kGe (all parameter sets). Keccak Threshold Implementation adds another 130 kGE.\r\n\r\nWe provide sensitivity analysis of SLH-DSA in relation to side-channel leakage. We show experimentally that an SLH-DSA implementation with CPU hashing will rapidly leak the SK.seed master key. We perform a 100,000-trace TVLA leakage assessment with a protected SLotH unit.",

    "abstract": "We devise algorithms for finding equivalences of trilinear forms over finite fields modulo linear group actions. Our focus is on two problems under this umbrella, Matrix Code Equivalence (MCE) and Alternating Trilinear Form Equivalence (ATFE), since their hardness is the foundation of the NIST round-$1$ signature candidates MEDS and ALTEQ respectively. \r\n\r\nWe present new algorithms for MCE and ATFE, which are further developments of the algorithms for polynomial isomorphism and alternating trilinear form equivalence, in particular by Bouillaguet, Fouque, and V\u00e9ber (Eurocrypt 2013), and Beullens (Crypto 2023). Key ingredients in these algorithms are new easy-to-compute distinguishing invariants under the respective group actions. \r\n\r\nFor MCE, we associate new isomorphism invariants to corank-$1$ points of matrix codes, which lead to a birthday-type algorithm. We present empirical justifications that these isomorphism invariants are easy-to-compute and distinguishing, and provide an implementation of this algorithm. This algorithm has some implications to the security of MEDS. \r\n\r\nThe invariant function for ATFE is similar, except it is associated with lower rank points. Modulo certain assumptions on turning the invariant function into canonical forms, our algorithm for ATFE improves on the runtime of the previously best known algorithm of Beullens (Crypto 2023).\r\n\r\nFinally, we present quantum variants of our classical algorithms with cubic runtime improvements.",

    "abstract": "Garbled Circuit (GC) is a basic technique for practical secure computation. GC handles Boolean circuits; it consumes significant network bandwidth  to transmit encoded gate truth tables,  each of which scales with the computational security parameter $\\kappa$. GC optimizations that reduce bandwidth consumption are valuable.\r\n\r\nIt is natural to consider a generalization of Boolean two-input  one-output gates (represented by $4$-row one-column lookup tables, LUTs) to arbitrary $N$-row $m$-column LUTs.   Known techniques for this do not scale, with naive size-$O(Nm\\kappa)$ garbled LUT being the most practical approach in many scenarios.\r\n\r\nOur novel garbling scheme -- logrow -- implements GC LUTs while sending only a logarithmic in $N$ number of ciphertexts! Specifically, let $n = \\lceil \\log_2 N \\rceil$. We allow the GC parties to evaluate a LUT  for $(n-1)\\kappa + nm\\kappa + Nm$ bits of communication.  logrow is compatible with modern GC advances, e.g. half gates and free XOR.\r\n\r\nOur work improves state-of-the-art GC handling of several interesting applications, such as  privacy-preserving machine learning, floating-point arithmetic, and DFA evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Consider the task of secure multiparty computation (MPC) among $n$ parties with perfect security and guaranteed output delivery, supporting $t<n/3$ active corruptions. Suppose the arithmetic circuit $C$ to be computed is defined over a finite ring $\\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z}$, for an arbitrary $q\\in\\mathbb{Z}$. It is known that this type of MPC over such ring is possible, with communication that scales as $O(n|C|)$, assuming that $q$ scales as $\\Omega(n)$. However, for constant-size rings $\\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z}$ where $q = O(1)$, the communication is actually $O(n\\log n|C|)$ due to the need of the so-called ring extensions. In most natural settings, the number of parties is variable but the \"datatypes\" used for the computation are fixed (e.g. 64-bit integers). In this regime, no protocol with linear communication exists.\r\nIn this work we provide an MPC protocol in this setting: perfect security, G.O.D. and $t<n/3$ active corruptions, that enjoys linear communication $O(n|C|)$, even for constant-size rings $\\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z}$. This includes as important particular cases small fields such as $\\mathbb{F}_2$, and also the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/2^k\\mathbb{Z}$. The main difficulty in achieving this result is that widely used techniques such as linear secret-sharing cannot work over constant-size rings, and instead, one must make use of ring extensions that add $\\Omega(\\log n)$ overhead, while packing $\\Omega(\\log n)$ ring elements in each extension element in order to amortize this cost. We make use of reverse multiplication-friendly embeddings (RMFEs) for this packing, and adapt recent techniques in network routing (Goyal et al. CRYPTO'22) to ensure this can be efficiently used for non-SIMD circuits. Unfortunately, doing this naively results in a restriction on the minimum width of the circuit, which leads to an extra additive term in communication of $\\mathsf{poly}(n)\\cdot\\mathsf{depth}(C)$. One of our biggest technical contributions lies in designing novel techniques to overcome this limitation by packing elements that are distributed across different layers. To the best of our knowledge, all works that have a notion of packing (e.g. RMFE or packed secret-sharing) group gates across the same layer, and not doing so, as in our work, leads to a unique set of challenges and complications.",

    "abstract": "Ascon, a family of algorithms that supports authenticated encryption and hashing, has been selected as the new standard for lightweight cryptography in the NIST Lightweight Cryptography Project. Ascon\u2019s permutation and authenticated encryption have been actively analyzed, but there are relatively few analyses on the hashing. In this paper, we concentrate on preimage attacks on Ascon-Xof. We focus on linearizing the polynomials leaked by the hash value to find its inverse. In an attack on 2-round Ascon-Xof, we carefully construct the set of guess bits using a greedy algorithm in the context of guess-and-determine. This allows us to attack Ascon-Xof more efficiently than the method in Dobraunig et al., and we fully implement our attack to demonstrate its effectiveness. We also provide the number of guess bits required to linearize one output bit after 3- and 4-round Ascon\u2019s permutation, respectively. In particular, for the first time, we connect the result for 3-round Ascon to a preimage attack on Ascon-Xof with a 64-bit output. Our attacks primarily focus on analyzing weakened versions of Ascon-Xof, where the weakening involves setting all the IV values to 0 and omitting the round constants. Although our attacks do not compromise the security of the full Ascon-Xof, they provide new insights into their security.",

    "abstract": "One of the most basic problems for studying the \"price of privacy over time\" is the so called private counter problem, introduced by Dwork et al. (2010) and Chan et al. (2010). In this problem, we aim to track the number of events that occur over time, while hiding the existence of every single event. More specifically, in every time step $t\\in[T]$ we learn (in an online fashion) that $\\Delta_t\\geq 0$ new events have occurred, and must respond with an estimate $n_t\\approx\\sum_{j=1}^t \\Delta_j$. The privacy requirement is that all of the outputs together, across all time steps, satisfy event level differential privacy. \r\n\r\nThe main question here is how our error needs to depend on the total number of time steps $T$ and the total number of events $n$. Dwork et al. (2015) showed an upper bound of $O\\left(\\log(T)+\\log^2(n)\\right)$, and Henzinger et al. (2023) showed a lower bound of $\\Omega\\left(\\min\\{\\log n, \\log T\\}\\right)$. We show a new lower bound of $\\Omega\\left(\\min\\{n,\\log T\\}\\right)$, which is tight w.r.t. the dependence on $T$, and is tight in the sparse case where $\\log^2 n=O(\\log T)$. Our lower bound has the following implications:\r\n\r\n(1) We show that our lower bound extends to the online thresholds problem, where the goal is to privately answer many \"quantile queries\" when these queries are presented one-by-one. This resolves an open question of Bun et al. (2017).\r\n\r\n(2) Our lower bound implies, for the first time, a separation between the number of mistakes obtainable by a private online learner and a non-private online learner. This partially resolves a COLT'22 open question published by Sanyal and Ramponi.\r\n\r\n(3) Our lower bound also yields the first separation between the standard model of private online learning and a recently proposed relaxed variant of it, called private online prediction.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by secure database search, we present secure computation protocols for a function $f$ in the client-servers setting, where a client can obtain $f(x)$ on a private input $x$ by communicating with multiple servers each holding $f$. Specifically, we propose generic compilers from passively secure protocols, which only keep security against servers following the protocols, to actively secure protocols, which guarantee privacy and correctness even against malicious servers. Our compilers are applied to protocols computing any class of functions, and are efficient in that the overheads in communication and computational complexity are only polynomial in the number of servers, independent of the complexity of functions. We then apply our compilers to obtain concrete actively secure protocols for various functions including private information retrieval (PIR), bounded-degree multivariate polynomials and constant-depth circuits. For example, our actively secure PIR protocols achieve exponentially better computational complexity in the number of servers than the currently best-known protocols. Furthermore, our protocols for polynomials and constant-depth circuits reduce the required number of servers compared to the previous actively secure protocols. In particular, our protocol instantiated from the sparse Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) assumption is the first actively secure protocol for multivariate polynomials which has the minimum number of servers, without assuming fully homomorphic encryption.",

    "abstract": "We study broadcast protocols in the information-theoretic model under optimal conditions, where the number of corruptions $t$ is at most one-third of the parties, $n$. While worst-case $\\Omega(n)$ round broadcast protocols are known to be impossible to achieve, protocols with an expected constant number of rounds have been demonstrated since the seminal work of Feldman and Micali [STOC'88]. Communication complexity for such protocols has gradually improved over the years, reaching $O(nL)$ plus expected $O(n^4\\log n)$ for broadcasting a message of size $L$ bits. \r\n\r\nThis paper presents a perfectly secure broadcast protocol with expected constant rounds and communication complexity of $O(nL)$ plus expected $O(n^3 \\log^2n)$ bits. In addition, we consider the problem of parallel broadcast, where $n$ senders, each wish to broadcast a message of size $L$. We show a parallel broadcast protocol with expected constant rounds and communication complexity of $O(n^2L)$ plus expected $O(n^3 \\log^2n)$ bits. Our protocol is optimal (up to expectation) for messages of length $L \\in \\Omega(n \\log^2 n)$.\r\n\r\nOur main contribution is a framework for obtaining perfectly secure broadcast with an expected constant number of rounds from a statistically secure verifiable secret sharing. Moreover, we provide a new statistically secure verifiable secret sharing where the broadcast cost per participant is reduced from $O(n \\log n)$ bits to only $O({\\sf poly} \\log n)$ bits. All our protocols are adaptively secure.",

    "abstract": "Symmetric ciphers operating in (small or mid-size) prime fields  have been shown to be promising candidates to maintain security against low-noise (or even noise-free) side-channel leakage.\r\nIn order to design prime ciphers that best trade physical security and  implementation efficiency, it is essential to understand how  side-channel security evolves with the field size (i.e., scaling trends).\r\nUnfortunately, it has also been shown that such a scaling trend depends on the leakage functions and cannot be explained by the  standard metrics used to analyze Boolean masking with noise.\r\nIn this work, we therefore initiate a formal study of prime field masking for two canonical leakage functions: bit leakages and Hamming weight leakages. By leveraging theoretical results from the leakage-resilient secret sharing literature, we explain formally why (1) bit leakages correspond to a worst-case and do not encourage operating in larger fields, and (2) an opposite conclusion holds for \r\nHamming weight leakages, where increasing the prime field modulus p can contribute to a security amplification that is exponential in the number of shares,with log(p) seen as security parameter like the noise variance in Boolean masking. We combine these theoretical results with experimental ones\r\nand show that the interest masking in larger prime fields can degrade gracefully when leakage functions slightly deviate from the Hamming weight abstraction, motivating further research towards characterizing (ideally wide) classes of leakage functions offering such guarantees.",

    "abstract": "This paper belongs to a sequence of manuscripts that discuss generic and easy-to-apply security metrics for Strong Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs).  These metrics cannot and shall not fully replace in-depth machine learning (ML) studies in the security assessment of Strong PUF candidates.  But they can complement the latter, serve in initial complexity analyses, and allow simple iterative design optimization.  Moreover, they are computationally more efficient and far easier to standardize than typical ML-studies.  This manuscript treats one very natural, but also very impactful metric, and investigates the effects that the alteration of single challenge bits has on the associated PUF-responses.  \r\nWe define several concrete metric scores based on this idea, and demonstrate their predictive power by applying them to various popular Strong PUF design families as test cases.  This includes XOR Arbiter PUFs, XOR Bistable Ring PUFs, and Feed-Forward Arbiter PUFs, whose practical security is particularly well known after two decades of intense research.  In passing, our manuscript also suggests techniques for representing our metric scores graphically, and for interpreting them in a meaningful manner.  Our work demonstrates that if comparable methods had existed earlier, various Strong PUF candidates deemed secure and broken later could have been recognized and winnowed early on.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new cryptographic primitive, called Sybil-Resilient Anonymous (SyRA) signatures, which enable users to generate, on demand, unlinkable pseudonyms tied to any given context, and issue signatures on behalf of these pseudonyms. Concretely, given a personhood relation, an issuer (who may be a distributed entity) enables users to prove their personhood and extract an associated long-term key, which can then be used to issue signatures for any given context and message. Sybil-resilient anonymous signatures achieve two key security properties: 1) Sybil resilience, which ensures that every user is entitled to at most one pseudonym per context, and 2) anonymity, which requires that no information about the user is leaked through their various pseudonyms or the signatures they issue on their pseudonyms\u2019 behalf. \r\nWe conceptualize SyRA signatures as an ideal functionality in the Universal Composition (UC) setting and realize the functionality via an efficient, pairing-based construction that utilizes two levels of verifiable random functions (VRFs), which may be of independent interest. One of the key features of this approach is the statelessness of the issuer: we achieve the core properties of Sybil resilience and anonymity without requiring the issuer to retain any information about past user interactions. SyRA signatures have various applications in multiparty systems, such as e-voting (e.g., for decentralized governance), privacy-preserving regulatory compliance (e.g., AML/CFT checks), and cryptocurrency airdrops, making them an attractive option for deployment in decentralized identity (DID) systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practicality of SyRA signatures for use in such systems by providing a performance evaluation of our construction.",

    "abstract": "A $t$-multi-collision-resistant hash function ($t$-MCRH) is a family of shrinking functions for which it is computationally hard to find $t$ distinct inputs mapping to the same output for a function sampled from this family. Several works have shown that $t$-MCRHs are sufficient for many of the applications of collision-resistant hash functions (CRHs), which correspond to the special case of $t = 2$. \r\n\r\nAn important question is hence whether $t$-MCRHs for $t > 2$ are fundamentally weaker objects than CRHs. As a first step towards resolving this question, Rothblum and Vasudevan (CRYPTO '22) recently gave non-black-box constructions of infinitely-often secure CRHs from $t$-MCRHs for $t \\in \\{3,4\\}$ assuming the MCRH is sufficiently shrinking. Earlier on, Komargodski and Yogev (CRYPTO '18) also showed that $t$-MCRHs for any constant $t$ imply the weaker notion of a distributional CRH.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we remove the limitations of prior works, and completely resolve the question of the power of $t$-MCRHs for constant $t$ in the infinitely-often regime, showing that the existence of such a function family always implies the existence of an infinitely-often secure CRH. As in the works mentioned above, our construction is non-blackbox and non-constructive. We further give a new domain extension result for MCRHs that enables us to show that the underlying MCRH need only have arbitrarily small linear shrinkage (mapping $(1 + \\epsilon)n$ bits to $n$ bits for any fixed $\\epsilon > 0$) to imply the existence of CRHs.",

    "abstract": "In recent years quantum computing has developed rapidly. The security threat posed by quantum computing to cryptography makes it necessary to better evaluate the resource cost of attacking algorithms, some of which require quantum implementations of the attacked cryptographic building blocks. In this paper we manage to optimize quantum circuits of AES in several aspects. Firstly, based on de Brugi\u00e8re \\textit{et al.}'s greedy algorithm, we propose an improved depth-oriented algorithm for synthesizing low-depth CNOT circuits with no ancilla qubits. Our algorithm finds a CNOT circuit of AES MixColumns with depth 10, which breaks a recent record of depth 16. In addition, our algorithm gives low-depth CNOT circuits for many MDS matrices and matrices used in block ciphers studied in related work. Secondly, we present a new structure named compressed pipeline structure to synthesize quantum circuits of AES, which can be used for constructing quantum oracles employed in quantum attacks based on Grover's and Simon's algorithms. When the number of ancilla qubits required by the round function and its inverse is not very large, our structure will have a better trade-off of $D$-$W$ cost. Moreover, our encryption oracle will have the lowest depth to date. We then give detailed encryption circuits of AES-128 under the guidance of our structure and make some comparisons with other circuits. Finally, the encryption part and the key schedule part have their own application scenarios. The Encryption oracle used in Simon's algorithm built with the former will have smaller round depth. For example, we can construct an AES-128 Encryption oracle with $T$-depth 33, while the previous best result is 60. A small variant of the latter, along with our method to make an Sbox input-invariant, can avoid the allocation of extra ancilla qubits for storing key words in the shallowed pipeline structure. Based on this, we achieve an encryption circuit of AES-128 with the lowest $TofD$-$W$ cost 130720 to date.",

    "abstract": "With the rapidly evolving landscape of cryptography, blockchain technology has advanced to cater to diverse user requirements, leading to the emergence of a multi-chain ecosystem featuring various use cases characterized by distinct transaction speed and decentralization trade-offs. At the heart of this evolution lies digital signature schemes, responsible for safeguarding blockchain-based assets such as ECDSA, Schnorr, and EdDSA, among others.\r\n\r\nHowever, a critical gap exists in the current landscape \u2014 there is no solution empowering a consortium of entities to collectively manage or generate digital signatures for diverse digital assets in a distributed manner with dynamic threshold settings, all while mitigating counter-party risks. Existing threshold signature schemes impose a fixed threshold during the key generation phase, limiting the adaptability of threshold settings for the subsequent signature phase. Attempts to address this challenge often involve relinquishing signature generation control either partially or entirely from the participating parties, introducing vulnerabilities that could jeopardize digital assets in the event of network disruptions.\r\n\r\nAddressing this gap, our work introduces an innovative infrastructure that allows a group of users to programmatically define and manage access control policies, supported by a blockchain network dedicated to policy enforcement. This network is uniquely designed to prevent any entity, including itself, from autonomously generating digital signatures, thereby mitigating counter-party risks and enhancing asset security. This system is particularly suited for enterprise contexts, where collaborative asset oversight and policy adherence are essential. Our solution marks a significant stride in the realm of blockchain technology, paving the way for more sophisticated and secure digital asset management in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.",

    "abstract": "This work models a secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system as a wiretap channel with action-dependent channel states and channel output feedback, e.g., obtained through reflections. The transmitted message is split into a common and a secure message, both of which must be reliably recovered at the legitimate receiver, while the secure message needs to be kept secret from the eavesdropper. The transmitter actions, such as beamforming vector design, affect the corresponding state at each channel use. The action sequence is modeled to depend on both the transmitted message and channel output feedback. For perfect channel output feedback, the secrecy-distortion regions are provided for physically-degraded and reversely-physically-degraded secure ISAC channels with transmitter actions. The corresponding rate regions when the entire message should be kept secret are also provided. The results are illustrated through characterizing the secrecy-distortion region of a binary example.",

    "abstract": "Since its invention in 1978 by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman, the public key cryptosystem RSA has become a widely popular and a widely useful scheme in cryptography. Its security is related to the difficulty of factoring large integers which are the product of two large prime numbers. For various reasons, several variants of RSA have been proposed, and some have different arithmetics such as elliptic and singular cubic curves. In 2018, Murru and Saettone proposed another variant of RSA based on the cubic Pell curve with a modulus of the form $N=pq$. In this paper, we present a new public key cryptosystem based on the arithmetic of the cubic Pell curve with a modulus of the form $N=p^rq^s$. Its security is based on the hardness of factoring composite integers, and on Rabin's trapdoor one way function. In the new scheme, the arithmetic operations are performed on a cubic Pell curve which is known only to the sender and the recipient of a plaintext.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present novel protocols over rings for semi-honest secure three-party computation (3PC) and malicious four-party computation (4PC) with one corruption. While most existing works focus on improving total communication complexity, challenges such as network heterogeneity and computational complexity, which impact MPC performance in practice, remain underexplored. \r\n\r\nOur protocols address these issues by tolerating multiple arbitrarily weak network links between parties without any substantial decrease in performance. Additionally, they significantly reduce computational complexity by requiring up to half the number of basic instructions per gate compared to related work. These improvements lead to up to twice the throughput of state-of-the-art protocols in homogeneous network settings and up to eight times higher throughput in real-world heterogeneous settings. These advantages come at no additional cost: Our protocols maintain the best-known total communication complexity per multiplication, requiring 3 elements for 3PC and 5 elements for 4PC.\r\n\r\nWe implemented our protocols alongside several state-of-the-art protocols (Replicated 3PC, ASTRA, Fantastic Four, Tetrad) in a novel open-source C++ framework optimized for high throughput. Five out of six implemented 3PC and 4PC protocols achieve more than one billion 32-bit multiplications or over 32 billion AND gates per second using our implementation in a 25 Gbit/s LAN environment. This represents the highest throughput achieved in 3PC and 4PC so far, outperforming existing frameworks like MP-SPDZ, ABY3, MPyC, and MOTION by two to three orders of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore a novel Zero-knowledge Virtual Machine (zkVM) framework leveraging succinct, non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs for verifiable computation over any code. Our approach divides program execution proof into two stages. In the first stage, the process breaks down program execution into segments, identifying and grouping identical sections. These segments are then proved through data-parallel circuits that allow for varying amounts of duplication. In the subsequent stage, the verifier examines these segment proofs, reconstructing the program's control and data flow based on the segments' duplication number and the original program. The second stage can be further attested by a uniform recursive proof.\r\n\r\nWe propose two specific designs of this concept, where segmentation and parallelization happen at two levels: opcode and basic block. Both designs try to minimize control flow that affects the circuit size and support dynamic copy numbers, ensuring that computational costs directly correlate with the actual code executed (i.e., you only pay as much as you use). In our second design, in particular, by proposing an innovative data-flow reconstruction technique in the second stage, we can drastically cut down on the stack operations even compared to the original program execution. Note that the two designs are complementary rather than mutually exclusive. Integrating both approaches in the same zkVM could unlock more significant potential for accommodating diverse program patterns.\r\n\r\nWe present an asymmetric GKR scheme to implement our designs, pairing a non-uniform prover and a uniform verifier to generate proofs for dynamic-length data-parallel circuits. The use of a GKR prover also significantly reduces the size of the commitment: GKR allows us to commit only the circuit's input and output, whereas in Plonkish-based solutions, the prover needs to commit to all the witnesses.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present two generic frameworks for leakage-resilient attribute-based encryption (ABE), which is an improved version of ABE that can be proven secure even when part of the secret key is leaked. Our frameworks rely on the standard assumption ($k$-Lin) over prime-order groups. The first framework is designed for leakage-resilient ABE with attribute-hiding in the bounded leakage model. Prior to this work, no one had yet derived a generic leakage-resilient ABE framework with attribute-hiding. The second framework provides a generic method to construct leakage-resilient ABE in the continual leakage model. It is compatible with Zhang et al.'s work [DCC 2018] but more generic. Concretely, Zhang et al.'s framework cannot act on some specific ABE schemes while ours manages to do that. Technically, our frameworks are built on the predicate encoding of Chen et al.'s [EUROCRYPT 2015] combined with a method of adding redundancy. At last, several instantiations are derived from our frameworks, which cover the cases of zero inner-product predicate and non-zero inner-product predicate.",

    "abstract": "Garbling schemes are one of the most fundamental objects in cryptography and have been studied extensively due to their broad applicability. The state-of-the-art is a construction in which XOR gates are free and AND gates require $3\\kappa/2+\\mathcal{O}(1)$ bits per gate, due to Rosulek and Roy (CRYPTO'21). An important technique in their garbling is slicing, which partitions the labels into two equal-length slices. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of the slicing technique for garbling schemes beyond the results introduced by Rosulek and Roy, demonstrating both its potential and its limitations. \r\n\r\nIn particular, we extend this technique to demonstrate the garbling of certain higher fan-in gadgets, and then use this to show that it is possible to garble 2-input AND gates at a cost of $4\\kappa/3 +\\mathcal{O}(1)$ bits. We then give a separation result showing that sliced garbling cannot be used to garble higher fan-in gadgets of degree $\\geq 3$ when restricted to making queries that are linear functions of the input labels to the random oracle. We further demonstrate the usefulness of our techniques in the context of oblivious garbling, a newly introduced concept for capturing circuit hiding from the garbler. The complexity of our construction is superior to that of universal circuits, and grows linearly with circuit size.",

    "abstract": "In this work we consider the task of designing information-theoretic MPC protocols for which the state of a given party can be recovered from a small amount of parties, a property we refer to as local repairability.\r\n  This is useful when considering MPC over dynamic settings where parties leave and join a computation, a scenario that has gained notable attention in recent literature.\r\n  Thanks to the results of (Cramer et al. EUROCRYPT'00), designing such protocols boils down to constructing a linear secret-sharing scheme (LSSS) with good locality, that is, each share is determined by only a small amount of other shares, that also satisfies the so-called multiplicativity property.\r\n  Previous constructions that achieve locality (e.g. using locally recoverable codes---LRCs) do not enjoy multiplicativity, and LSSS that are multiplicative (e.g. Shamir's secret-sharing) do not satisfy locality.\r\n  Our construction bridges this literature gap by showing the existence of an LSSS that achieves both properties simultaneously.\r\n\r\n  Our results are obtained by making use of well known connection between error correcting codes and LSSS, in order to adapt the LRC construction by (Tamo & Barg, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 2014) to turn it into a LSSS.\r\n  With enough care, such coding-theoretic construction yields our desired locality property, but it falls short at satisfying multiplicativity.\r\n  In order to address this, we perform an extensive analysis of the privacy properties of our scheme in order to identify parameter regimes where our construction satisfies multiplicativity.\r\n\r\n  Finally, since our LSSS satisfies locality, every share is determined by a small amount of shares.\r\n  However, in an MPC context it is not enough to let the (small set of) parties to send their shares to the repaired party, since this may leak more information than the regenerated share.\r\n  To obtain our final result regarding MPC with local repairability, we construct a lightweight MPC protocol that performs such repairing process without any leakage.\r\n  We provide both a passively secure construction (for the plain multiplicative regime) and an actively secure one (for strong multiplicativity).",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a heuristic ideal obfuscation scheme grounded in the lattice problems, which differs from that proposed by Jain, Lin, and Luo ([JLLW23], CRYPTO 2023). The approach in this paper follows a methodology akin to that of Brakerski, Dottling, Garg, and Malavolta ([BDGM20], EUROCRYPT 2020) for building indistinguishable obfuscation (iO). The proposal is achieved by leveraging a variant of learning with rounding (LWR) to build linearly homomorphic encryption (LHE) and employing {\\em Evasive LWR} to construct multilinear maps. Initially, we reprove the hardness of LWR using the prime number theorem and the fixed-point theorem, showing that the statistical distance between $\\lfloor As\\rfloor_p$ and $\\lfloor u\\rfloor_p$ does not exceed $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{n\\log_2n\\ln p}{\\sqrt{5}}\\right)$ when the security parameter $q>2^{n}p$. Additionally, we provide definitions for {\\em Evasive LWR} and {\\em composite homomorphic pseudorandom function} (cHPRF), and based on these, we construct multilinear maps, thereby establishing the ideal obfuscation scheme proposed in this paper.",

    "abstract": "Syndrome decoding problem (SDP) is the security assumption of the code-based cryptography. Three out of the four NIST-PQC round 4 candidates are code-based cryptography. Information set decoding (ISD) is known for the fastest existing algorithm to solve SDP instances with relatively high code rate. Security of code-based cryptography is often constructed on the asymptotic complexity of the ISD algorithm. However, the concrete complexity of the ISD algorithm has hardly ever been known. Recently, Esser, May and Zweydinger (Eurocrypt '22) provide the first implementation of the representation-based ISD, such as May--Meurer--Thomae (MMT) or Becker--Joux--May--Meurer (BJMM) algorithm and solve the McEliece-1284 instance in the decoding challenge, revealing the practical efficiency of these ISDs.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose a practically fast depth-2 BJMM algorithm and provide the first publicly available GPU implementation. We solve the McEliece-1409 instance for the first time and present concrete analysis for the record. Cryptanalysis for NIST-PQC round 4 code-based candidates against the improved BJMM algorithm is also conducted. In addition, we revise the asymptotic space complexity of the time-memory trade-off MMT algorithm presented by Esser and Zweydinger (Eurocrypt '23) from $2^{0.375n}$ to $2^{0.376n}$.",

    "abstract": "Confidentiality and authentication are two main security goals in secure electronic mail (e-mail). Furthermore, deniability is also a significant security property for some e-mail applications to protect the privacy of the sender. Although searchable encryption solves the keyword searching problem in a secure e-mail system, it also breaks the deniability of the system. Because the adversary can obtain the information of the data sender and data user from the trapdoor as well as ciphertext used for keyword searching. At the same time, efficiency is another problem in mobile computing. To overcome the issues, we put forward deniably authenticated searchable public key encryption (DA-SPKE) which can apply to the deniable e-mail system. We first define the DA-SPKE model and propose the DA-SPKE scheme. Then we prove its security in the random oracle model and evaluate its efficiency. Finally, we use it in a deniably secure e-mail system to protect both data senders\u2019 and data users' privacy.",

    "abstract": "Proofs of Liabilities (PoL) allow an untrusted prover to commit to its liabilities towards a set of users and then prove independent users' amounts or the total sum of liabilities, upon queries by users or third-party auditors. This application setting is highly dynamic. User liabilities may increase/decrease arbitrarily and the prover needs to update proofs in epoch increments (e.g., once a day for a crypto-asset exchange platform). However, prior works mostly focus on the static case and trivial extensions to the dynamic setting open the system to windows of opportunity for the prover to under-report its liabilities and rectify its books in time for the next check, unless all users check their liabilities at all epochs. In this work, we develop Notus, the first dynamic PoL system for general liability updates that avoids this issue. Moreover, it achieves $O(1)$ query proof size, verification time, and auditor overhead-per-epoch.\r\n  The core building blocks underlying Notus are a novel zero-knowledge (and SNARK-friendly) RSA accumulator and a corresponding zero-knowledge MultiSwap protocol, which may be of independent interest. We then propose optimizations to reduce the prover's update overhead and make Notus scale to large numbers of users ($10^6$ in our experiments). Our results are very encouraging, e.g., it takes less than $2$ms to verify a user's liability and the proof size is $256$ Bytes. On the prover side, deploying Notus on a cloud-based testbed with eight 32-core machines and exploiting parallelism, it takes ${\\sim}3$ minutes to perform the complete epoch update, after which all proofs have already been computed.",

    "abstract": "Verifiable random functions (VRFs) are  pseudorandom functions with the addition that the function owner can prove that a generated output is correct (i.e., generated correctly relative to a committed key). In this paper we introduce the notion of an exponent-VRF (eVRF): a VRF that  does not provide its output $y$ explicitly, but instead provides $Y = y \\cdot G$, where $G$ is a generator of some finite cyclic group (or $Y=g^y$ in multiplicative notation). We construct eVRFs from DDH and from the Paillier encryption scheme (both in the random-oracle model).  We then show that an eVRF is a powerful tool that has many important applications in threshold cryptography. In particular, we construct (1) a one-round fully simulatable distributed key-generation protocol (after a single two-round initialization phase), (2) a two-round fully simulatable signing protocol for multiparty Schnorr with a deterministic variant,  (3) a two-party ECDSA protocol that has a deterministic variant, (4) a threshold Schnorr signing protocol where the parties can later prove that they signed without being able to frame another group, and (5) an MPC-friendly and verifiable HD-derivation.  All these applications are derived from this single new eVRF abstraction. The resulting protocols are concretely efficient.",

    "abstract": "The Fiat-Shamir transform [1] is a well-known and widely employed technique for converting sound public-coin interactive protocols into sound non-interactive protocols. Even though the transformation itself is relatively clear and simple, some implementations choose to deviate from the specifications, for example for performance reasons. In this short note, we present a vulnerability arising from such a deviation in a KZG-based PLONK verifier implementation. This deviation stemmed from the incorrect computation of the last challenge of the PLONK protocol [2], where the KZG batching proof challenge was computed before, and, hence, independently from the KZG evaluation proofs. More generally, such a vulnerability may affect any KZG [3] implementation where one uses batched KZG proof evaluations for at least two distinct evaluation points. We call an attack enabled by such a deviation a Last Challenge Attack. For concreteness, we show that when a PLONK verifier implementation presents such a deviation, a malicious PLONK prover can mount a Last Challenge Attack to construct verifiable proofs of false statements. The described vulnerability was initially discovered as part of an audit, and has been responsibly disclosed to the developers and fixed. A proof of concept of the vulnerability, in which a proof is forged for an arbitrary public input, is made available.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, in this work we also provide a security proof of the knowledge-soundness of the batched KZG scheme with evaluations for at least two distinct values.",

    "abstract": "While classic result in the 1980s establish that one-way functions (OWFs) imply the existence of pseudorandom generators (PRGs) which in turn imply pseudorandom functions (PRFs), the constructions (most notably the one from OWFs to PRGs) is complicated and inefficient.\r\n\r\nConsequently, researchers have developed alternative \\emph{direct} constructions of PRFs from various different concrete hardness assumptions. In this work, we continue this thread of work and demonstrate the first direct constructions of PRFs from average-case hardness of the time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity problem $\\mktp[s]$, where given a threshold, $s(\\cdot)$, and a polynomial time-bound, $t(\\cdot)$, $\\mktp[s]$ denotes the language consisting of strings $x$ with $t$-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, $K^t(x)$, bounded by $s(|x|)$.\r\n\r\nIn more detail, we demonstrate a direct PRF construction with quasi-polynomial security from mild average-case of hardness of $\\mktp[2^{O(\\sqrt{\\log n})}]$ w.r.t the uniform distribution. We note that by earlier results, this \r\nassumption is known to be equivalent to the existence of quasi-polynomially secure OWFs; as such, our results yield the first direct (quasi-polynomially secure) PRF constructions from a natural hardness assumptions that also is known to be implied by (quasi-polynomially secure) PRFs.\r\n\r\nPerhaps surprisingly, we show how to make use of the Nisan-Wigderson PRG construction to get a cryptographic, as opposed to a complexity-theoretic, PRG.",

    "abstract": "We present a new post-quantum Public Key Encryption scheme (PKE) named  Supersingular Isogeny Lollipop Based Encryption or SILBE. SILBE is obtained by leveraging the generalised lollipop attack of Castryck and Vercauteren on the M-SIDH Key exchange by Fouotsa, Moriya and Petit.\r\nDoing so, we can in fact make SILBE a post-quantum secure  Updatable Public Key Encryption scheme (UPKE). SILBE is in fact the first  isogeny-based UPKE which is not based on group actions. Hence, SILBE overcomes the limitations highlighted by Eaton, Jao, Komlo and Mokrani at SAC'21 regarding the design of an SIDH-style UPKE. This is possible by leveraging both the Deuring Correspondence and Kani's Lemma, two central concepts in Isogeny-Based Cryptography.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a toolkit for transforming lattice-based hash-and-sign signature schemes into masking-friendly signatures secure in the t-probing model. Until now, efficiently masking lattice-based hash-and-sign schemes has been an open problem, with unsuccessful attempts such as Mitaka. A first breakthrough was made in 2023 with the NIST PQC submission Raccoon, although it was not formally proven.\r\n    \r\nOur main conceptual contribution is to realize that the same principles underlying Raccoon are very generic, and to find a systematic way to apply them within the hash-and-sign paradigm. Our main technical contribution is to formalize, prove, instantiate and implement a hash-and-sign scheme based on these techniques. Our toolkit includes noise flooding to mitigate statistical leaks, and an extended Strong Non-Interfering probing security (SNIu) property to handle masked gadgets with unshared inputs.\r\n\r\nWe showcase the efficiency of our techniques in a signature scheme, Plover, based on (hint) Ring-LWE. It is the first lattice-based masked hash-and-sign scheme with quasi-linear complexity O(d log d) in the number of shares d. Our performances are competitive with the state-of-the-art masking-friendly signature, the Fiat-Shamir scheme Raccoon.",

    "abstract": "Multiparty private set intersection (mPSI) protocol is capable of finding the intersection of multiple sets securely without revealing any other information. However, its limitation lies in processing only those elements present in every participant's set, which proves inadequate in scenarios where certain elements are common to several, but not all, sets.\r\n    In this paper, we introduce an innovative variant of the mPSI protocol named unbalanced quorum PSI to fill in the gaps of the mPSI protocol. Unlike the previous quorum-PSI proposals which detect elements present in at least $k$ out of $n$ equal sets, our protocol is particularly tailored for unbalanced cases where the size of the receiver's set is much smaller than the size of the senders' sets. Our work achieves logarithmic communication complexity in the semi-honest setting, significantly surpassing previous work in efficiency.\r\n    The benchmarks show that it takes 22.7 seconds in WAN and 14.7 seconds in LAN for online computation, and only 87.8 MB of total communication to intersect 5535 elements across 15 sets, each containing $2^{24}$ elements. Compared to prior work, this is roughly an 87$\\times$ reduction in communication and a 31$\\times$ reduction in online time. Our protocols can be easily extended to the larger set with $2^{28}$ elements which is nearly impractical for prior work.",

    "abstract": "Byzantine Agreement (BA) enables $n$ processes to reach consensus on a common valid $L_o$-bit value, even in the presence of up to $t<n$ faulty processes that can deviate arbitrarily from their prescribed protocol. Despite its significance, the optimal communication complexity for key variations of BA has not been determined within the honest majority regime ($n=2t+1$), for both the worst-case scenario and the adaptive scenario, which accounts for the actual number $f \\leq t$ of failures. \r\nWe introduce ADA-DARE (Adaptively Disperse, Agree, Retrieve), a novel universal approach to solve BA efficiently. Let $\\kappa$ represent the size of the cryptographic objects required to solve BA when $t>n/3$. Different instantiations of ADA-DARE achieve near-optimal adaptive bit complexity of $O(nL_o + n(f + 1) \\kappa)$ for both strong multi-valued validated BA (SMVBA) and interactive consistency (IC). By definition, for IC, $L_o = nL_{in}$, with $L_{in}$ representing the size of an input value.\r\nThese results achieve optimal $O(n(L_o+f))$ word complexity and significantly improve the previous best results by up to a linear factor, depending on $L_o$ and $f$.",

    "abstract": "The DECT Standard Cipher (DSC) is a proprietary stream cipher used for encryption in the Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT), which is a standard for short range cordless communication and widely deployed worldwide both in residential and enterprise environments. New weaknesses of the DSC stream cipher which are not discovered in previous works are explored and analyzed in this paper. Based on these weaknesses, new practical key recovery attacks and distinguishing attack on DSC with lower time cost are proposed. The first cryptanalytic result show that DSC can be broken in about 13.12 seconds in the known IV setting, when an offline phase that takes about 58.33 minutes is completed. After then, a distinguishing attack on DSC in the related key chosen IV setting is given, which has a time complexity of only 2 encryptions and a success probability of almost 1. Finally, based on the slide property, a key recovery attack on DSC with practical complexities is proposed. The experimental result shows that DSC can be broken on a common PC within about 44.97 seconds in the multiple related key setting. The attacks on DSC proposed in this paper clearly show that a well-designed initialization is absolutely necessary to design a secure stream cipher.",

    "abstract": "Suppose Alice uses a $t$-out-of-$n$ secret sharing to store her secret key on $n$ servers. Her secret key is protected as long as $t$ of them do not collude. However, what if a less-than-$t$ subset of the servers decides to offer the shares they have for sale? In this case, Alice should be able to hold them accountable, or else nothing prevents them from selling her shares. With this motivation in mind, Goyal, Song, and Srinivasan (CRYPTO 21) introduced the concept of {\\em traceable secret sharing}. In such schemes, it is possible to provably trace the leaked secret shares back to the servers who leaked them. Goyal et al.~presented the first construction of a traceable secret sharing scheme. However, secret shares in their construction are quadratic in the secret size, and their tracing algorithm is quite involved as it relies on Goldreich-Levin decoding. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we put forth new definitions and practical constructions for traceable secret sharing. In our model, some $f < t$ servers output a reconstruction box~$R$ that may arbitrarily depend on their shares. Given additional $t-f$ shares, $R$ reconstructs and outputs the secret. The task is to trace $R$ back to the corrupted servers given \r\nblack-box access to $R$. Unlike Goyal et al., we do not assume that the tracing algorithm has any information on how the corrupted servers constructed~$R$ from the shares in their possession. \r\n\r\nWe then present two very efficient constructions of traceable secret sharing based on two classic secret sharing schemes. In both of our schemes, shares are only twice as large as the secret, improving over the quadratic overhead of Goyal et al. Our first scheme is obtained by presenting a new practical tracing algorithm for the widely-used Shamir secret sharing scheme. Our second construction is based on an extension of Blakley's secret sharing scheme. Tracing in this scheme is optimally efficient, and requires just one successful query to $R$. We believe that our constructions are an important step towards bringing traceable secret-sharing schemes to practice. This work also raises several interesting open problems that we describe\r\nin the paper.",

    "abstract": "It is known that the sponge construction is tightly indifferentiable from a random oracle up to around $2^{c/2}$ queries, where $c$ is the capacity. In particular, it cannot provide generic security better than half of the underlying permutation size. In this paper, we aim to achieve hash function security beating this barrier. We present a hashing mode based on two $b$-bit permutations named the double sponge. The double sponge can be seen as the sponge embedded within the double block length hashing paradigm, making two permutation calls in parallel interleaved with an efficient mixing function. Similarly to the sponge, the permutation size is split as $b = r+c$, and the underlying compression function  absorbs $r$ bits at a time. We prove that the double sponge is indifferentiable from a random oracle up to around $2^{2c/3}$ queries. This means that the double sponge achieves security beyond the birthday bound in the capacity. In addition, if $c>3b/4$, the double sponge beats the birthday bound in the primitive size, to our knowledge being the first hashing mode based on a permutation that accomplices this feature.",

    "abstract": "The Bitcoin ecosystem has continued to evolve beyond its initial promises of decentralization, transparency, and security. Recent advancements have notably been made with the integration of Layer-2 solutions, which address scalability issues by offloading transactions from the main blockchain. This facilitates faster and more cost-effective transactions while maintaining integrity. The advent of inscriptions and ordinal protocols has further broadened the spectrum of capabilities, enabling the creation of unique, indivisible assets on the blockchain. Despite these technological strides, the inherent limitations of Bitcoin's script being Turing-incomplete restrict complex executions directly on the blockchain, necessitating the use of Bitcoin indexers. These indexers act as off-chain execution layers, allowing for the incorporation of Turing-complete programming languages to manage and update state transitions based on blockchain data. However, this off-chain solution introduces challenges to data integrity and availability, compounded by the decentralized nature of blockchain which complicates data maintenance and accuracy.\r\n\r\nTo address these challenges, we propose a new modular indexer architecture that enables a fully decentralized and user-verified network, mitigating the risks associated with traditional decentralized indexer networks susceptible to Sybil attacks. Our solution, INDECURE, leverages polynomial commitments as checkpoints to streamline the verification process, significantly reducing the overhead associated with integrity checks of state transitions. By implementing a robust data attestation procedure, INDECURE ensures the reliability of state information against malicious alterations, facilitating trustless verifications by users. Our preliminary evaluations of INDECURE across various indexer protocols\u2014BRC20, Bitmap, and satsnames\u2014demonstrate its superiority in reducing computation time and data block size while maintaining high integrity in state transitions. This modular approach not only enhances the security and efficiency of Bitcoin's off-chain executions but also sets a foundational layer for scalable, secure blockchain applications.",

    "abstract": "Imagine being able to deploy a small, battery-powered device nearly anywhere on earth that humans frequent and having it be able to send data to the cloud without needing to provision a network\u2014without buying a physical gateway, setting up WiFi credentials, or acquiring a cellular SIM. Such a capability would address one of the greatest bottlenecks to deploying the long-tail of small, embedded, and power-constrained IoT devices in nearly any setting. Unfortunately, decoupling the device deployment from the network configuration needed to transmit, or backhaul, sensor data to the cloud remains a tricky challenge, but the success of Tile and AirTag offers hope. They have shown that mobile phones can crowd-source worldwide local network coverage to find lost items, yet expanding these systems to enable general-purpose backhaul raises privacy concerns for network participants. In this work, we present Nebula, a privacy-focused architecture for global, intermittent, and low-rate data backhaul to enable nearly any thing to eventually connect to the cloud while (i) preserving the privacy of the mobile network participants from the platform provider by decentralizing data flow through the system, (ii) incentivizing participation through micropayments, and (iii) preventing system abuse.",

    "abstract": "The Fiat-Shamir with Aborts paradigm (FSwA) uses rejection sampling to remove a secret\u2019s dependency on a given source distribution. Recent results revealed that unlike the uniform distribution in the hypercube, both the continuous Gaussian and the uniform distribution within the hypersphere minimise the rejection rate and the size of the proof of knowledge. However, in practice both these distributions suffer from the complexity of their sampler. So far, those three distributions are the only available alternatives, but none of them offer the best of all worlds: competitive proof of knowledge size and rejection rate with a simple sampler.\r\nWe introduce a new generic framework for FSwA using polytope based rejection sampling to enable a wider variety of constructions. As a matter of fact, this framework is the first to generalise these results to integral distributions. To complement the lack of alternatives, we also propose a new polytope construction, whose uniform sampler approaches in simplicity that of the hypercube. At the same time, it provides competitive proof of knowledge size compared to that obtained from the Gaussian distribution. Concurrently, we share some experimental improvements of our construction to further reduce the proof size. Finally, we propose a signature based on the FSwA paradigm using both our framework and construction. We prove it to be competitive with Haetae in signature size and with Dilithium on sampler simplicity.",

    "abstract": "A ranking function for permutations maps every permutation of length $n$ to a unique integer between $0$ and $n!-1$. For permutations of size that are of interest in cryptographic applications, evaluating such a function requires multiple-precision arithmetic. This work introduces a quasi-optimal ranking technique that allows us to rank a permutation efficiently without needing a multiple-precision arithmetic library. We present experiments that show the computational advantage of our method compared to the standard lexicographic optimal permutation ranking. As an application of our result, we show how this technique improves the signature sizes and the efficiency of PERK digital signature scheme.",

Additionally, we obtain balanced functions when we restrict its domain to vectors with even Hamming weight, i.e., an equal number of pre-images for 0 and 1.

Additionally, we demonstrate that the bent functions, in general, are balanced by restricting them to vectors of even Hamming or odd Hamming weight.

    "abstract": "Sponge hashing is a widely used class of cryptographic hash algorithms which underlies the current international hash function standard SHA-3. In a nutshell, a sponge function takes as input a bit-stream of any length and processes it via a simple iterative procedure: it repeatedly feeds each block of the input into a so-called block function, and then produces a digest by once again iterating the block function on the final output bits. While much is known about the post-quantum security of the sponge construction when the block function is modeled as a random function or one-way permutation, the case of invertible permutations, which more accurately models the construction underlying SHA-3, has so far remained a fundamental open problem.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we make new progress towards overcoming this barrier and show several results. First, we prove the ``double-sided zero-search'' conjecture proposed by Unruh (eprint' 2021) and show that finding zero-pairs in a random $2n$-bit permutation requires at least $\\Omega(2^{n/2})$ many queries---and this is tight due to Grover's algorithm. At the core of our proof lies a novel ``symmetrization argument'' which uses insights from the theory of Young subgroups. Second, we consider more general variants of the double-sided search problem and show similar query lower bounds for them. As an application, we prove the quantum one-wayness of the single-round sponge with invertible permutations in the quantum random oracle model.",

    "abstract": "In the linear garbling model introduced by Zahur, Rosulek, and Evans (Eurocrypt 2015), garbling an AND gate requires at least \\(2\\kappa\\) bits of ciphertext, where $\\kappa$ is the security parameter. Though subsequent works, including those by Rosulek and Roy (Crypto 2021) and Acharya et al. (ACNS 2023), have advanced beyond these linear constraints, a more comprehensive design framework is yet to be developed. \r\n\r\nOur work offers a novel, unified, and arguably simple perspective on garbled circuits. We introduce a hierarchy of models that captures all existing practical garbling schemes. By determining the lower bounds for these models, we elucidate the capabilities and limits of each. Notably, our findings suggest that simply integrating a nonlinear processing function or probabilistic considerations does not break the \\(2\\kappa\\) lower bound by Zahur, Rosulek, and Evans. However, by incorporating column correlations, the bound can be reduced to \\((1+1/w)\\kappa\\), where \\(w\\ge 1\\). Additionally, we demonstrate that a straightforward extension of Rosulek and Roy's technique (Crypto 2021) does not yield improved results. We also present a methodology for crafting new models and for exploring further extensions of both the new and the existing models.  \r\n\r\nOur new models set the course for future designs. We introduce three innovative garbling schemes based on a common principle called ``majority voting.'' The third construction performs on par with the state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "We present a framework for building efficient folding-based SNARKs. First we develop a new \"uniformizing\" compiler for NP statements that converts any poly-time computation to a sequence of  identical simple steps. The resulting uniform computation is especially well-suited to be processed by a folding-based IVC scheme. Second, we develop two optimizations to folding-based IVC. The first reduces the recursive overhead of the IVC by restructuring the relation to which folding is applied. The second employs a \"commit-and-fold'' strategy to further simplify the relation. Together, these optimizations result in a folding based SNARK that has a number of attractive features. First, the scheme uses a constant-size transparent common reference string (CRS). Second, the prover has \r\n(i) low memory footprint,\r\n(ii) makes only two passes over the data, \r\n(iii) is highly parallelizable, and\r\n(iv) is concretely efficient.\r\nMicrobenchmarks indicate that proving time is competitive with leading monolithic SNARKs, and significantly faster than other streaming SNARKs. For $2^{24}$ ($2^{32}$) gates, the Mangrove prover is estimated to take $2$ minutes ($8$ hours) with peak memory usage approximately $390$ MB ($800$ MB) on a laptop.",

    "abstract": "Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) has attracted much attention recently. Chinese remainder representation (CRR) or RNS representation is one of the core technologies of FHE. CRR basis conversion is a key step of KeySwitching procedure. Bajard et al. proposed a fast basis conversion method for CRR basis conversion, but the elimination of error had to be ignored. Halevi et al. suggested a method using floating-point arithmetic to avoid errors, but floating-point arithmetic has its own issues such as low efficiency and complex chip design. In this work, we establish a more concise and efficient CRR basis conversion method by observing that  each of the  ciphertext modulus selected \r\nby the CRR CKKS scheme is very close to an integer that is a power of 2. Our conversion algorithm eliminates errors and involves only integer arithmetic and bit operations. The proof of correctness of our algorithm is given. Extensive experiments are conducted and comparisons between the method of Halevi et al. and ours are obtained, which show that our method has the same accuracy and a slightly better effeciency.  Our method is also applicable to the CRR variant of BGV and BFV schemes, and can be used to simplify chip design.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a blockchain Fair Data Exchange (FDE) protocol, enabling a storage server to transfer a data file to a client atomically: the client receives the file if and only if the server receives an agreed-upon payment. We put forth a new definition for a cryptographic scheme that we name verifiable encryption under committed key (VECK), and we propose two instantiations for this scheme. Our protocol relies on a blockchain to enforce the atomicity of the exchange and uses VECK to ensure that the client receives the correct data (matching an agreed-upon commitment) before releasing the payment for the decrypting key. Our protocol is trust-minimized and requires only constant-sized on-chain communication, concretely 3 signatures, 1 verification key, and 1 secret key, with most of the data stored and communicated off-chain. It also supports exchanging only a subset of the data, can amortize the server's work across multiple clients, and offers a general framework to design alternative FDE protocols using different commitment schemes. A prominent application of our protocol is the Danksharding data availability scheme on Ethereum, which commits to data via KZG polynomial commitments. We also provide an open-source implementation for our protocol with both instantiations for VECK, demonstrating our protocol's efficiency and practicality on Ethereum.",

    "abstract": "Evolving secret-sharing schemes, defined by Komargodski, Naor, and Yogev [TCC 2016B, IEEE Trans. on Info. Theory 2018], are secret-sharing schemes in which there is no a-priory bound on the number of parties. In such schemes, parties arrive one by one; when a party arrives, the dealer gives it a share and cannot update this share in later stages. The requirement is that some predefined sets (called authorized sets) should be able to reconstruct the secret, while other sets should learn no information on the secret. The collection of authorized sets that can reconstruct the secret is called an evolving access structure. The challenge of the dealer is to be able to give short shares to the the current parties without knowing how many parties will arrive in the future. The requirement that the dealer cannot update shares is designed to prevent expensive updates.\r\nKomargodski et al. constructed an evolving secret-sharing scheme for every monotone evolving access structure; the share size of the $t^{\\text{th}}$ party in this scheme is $2^{t-1}$.\r\nRecently, Mazor [ITC 2023] proved that evolving secret-sharing schemes require exponentially-long shares for some evolving access structure, namely shares of size $2^{t-o(t)}$.In light of these results, our goal is to construct evolving secret-sharing schemes with non-trivial share size for wide classes of evolving access structures;  e.g., schemes with share size $2^{ct}$  for $c<1$ or even polynomial size. We provide several results achieving this goal:\r\n-We define layered infinite branching programs representing evolving access structures, show how to transform them into generalized infinite decision trees, and show how to construct evolving secret-sharing schemes for generalized infinite decision trees. Combining these steps, we get a secret-sharing scheme realizing the evolving access structure.\r\nAs an application of this framework, we construct an evolving secret-sharing scheme with non-trivial share size for access structures that can be represented by layered infinite branching programs with width at layer $t$ of at most $2^{0.15t}$. If the width is polynomial, then we get an evolving secret-sharing scheme with quasi-polynomial share size.\r\n -We construct efficient evolving secret-sharing schemes for dynamic-threshold access structures with high dynamic-threshold and for infinite $2$ slice and $3$-slice access structures. The share size of the $t^{\\text{th}}$ party in these schemes is $2^{\\tilde{O}((\\log t)^{1/\\sqrt{2}+\\epsilon})}$ for any constant $\\epsilon>0$, which is comparable to the best-known share size of $2^{\\tilde{O}((\\log t)^{1/2}))}$ for finite $2$-slice and 3-slice access structures.\r\n-We prove lower bounds on the share size of evolving secret-sharing schemes for infinite $k$-hypergraph access structures and for infinite directed st-connectivity access structures. As a by-product of the lower bounds, we provide the first non-trivial lower bound for finite directed st-connectivity access structures for general secret-sharing schemes.",

    "abstract": "Linkable ring signatures are an important cryptographic primitive for anonymized applications, such as e-voting, e-cash and confidential transactions. To eliminate backdoor and overhead in a trusted setup, transparent setup in the discrete logarithm or pairing settings has received considerable attention in practice. Recent advances have improved the proof sizes and verification efficiency of linkable ring signatures with a transparent setup to achieve logarithmic bounds. Omniring (CCS '19) and RingCT 3.0 (FC '20) proposed linkable ring signatures in the discrete logarithm setting with logarithmic proof sizes with respect to the ring size, whereas DualDory (ESORICS '22) achieves logarithmic verifiability in the pairing setting. We make three novel contributions in this paper to improve the efficiency and soundness of logarithmic linkable ring signatures: (1) We identify an attack on DualDory that breaks its linkability. (2) To eliminate such an attack, we present a new linkable ring signature scheme in the pairing setting with logarithmic verifiability. (3) We also improve the verification efficiency of linkable ring signatures in the discrete logarithm setting, by a technique of reducing the number of group exponentiations  for verification in Omniring by 50%. Furthermore, our technique is applicable to general inner-product relation proofs, which might be of independent interest. Finally, we empirically evaluate our schemes and compare them with the extant linkable ring signatures in concrete implementation.",

    "abstract": "Hardening microprocessors against side-channel attacks is a critical aspect of ensuring their security. A key step in this process is identifying and mitigating \u201cleaky\" hardware modules, which leak information during the execution of cryptographic algorithms. \r\nIn this paper, we explore how different leakage detection methods, the Side-channel Vulnerability Factor (SVF) and the Test Vector Leakage Assessment (TVLA), contribute to hardening of microprocessors. We conduct experiments on two RISC-V cores, SHAKTI and Ibex, using two cryptographic algorithms, SHA-3 and AES. Our findings suggest that SVF and TVLA can provide valuable insights into identifying leaky modules. However, the effectiveness of these methods can vary depending on the specific core and cryptographic algorithm in use. \r\nWe conclude that the choice of leakage detection method should be based not only on computational cost but also on the specific requirements of the system, the implementation of the algorithm examined and the nature of the potential threats.",

    "abstract": "Approximate fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes, such as the CKKS scheme (Cheon, Kim, Kim, Song, ASIACRYPT '17), are among the leading schemes in terms of efficiency and are particularly suitable for Machine Learning (ML) tasks. Although efficient, approximate FHE schemes have some inherent risks: Li and Micciancio (EUROCRYPT '21) demonstrated that while these schemes achieved the standard notion of CPA-security, they failed against a variant, $\\mathsf{IND}\\mbox{-}\\mathsf{CPA}^D$, in which the adversary is given limited access to the decryption oracle. Subsequently, Li, Micciancio, Schultz, and Sorrell (CRYPTO '22) proved that with noise-flooding countermeasures which add Gaussian noise of sufficiently high variance before outputting the decrypted value, the CKKS scheme is secure. However, the variance required for provable security is very high, inducing a large loss in message precision.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we consider a broad class of attacks on CKKS with noise-flooding countermeasures, which we call ``semi-honest'' attacks, in which an adversary may submit only correctly distributed ciphertexts to the decryption oracle. The ciphertexts submitted for decryption can be fresh ciphertexts, or can be ciphertexts resulting from the homomorphic evaluation of some circuit on fresh and independent ciphertexts. Our motivation is to model an internal threat scenario where an adversary can passively access the internal randomness of the system. \r\n\r\nWe analyze the concrete security of CKKS with various levels of noise-flooding in the face of such attacks. The aim of this work is to outline and precisely quantify the various trade-offs between the number of allowed decryptions before refreshing the keys, noise-flooding levels, and the concrete security of the scheme after a number of decryptions have been observed by the adversary.\r\n\r\nDue to the large dimension and modulus in typical FHE parameter sets, previous techniques even for \\emph{estimating} the concrete runtime of such attacks -- such as those in (Dachman-Soled, Ducas, Gong, Rossi, CRYPTO '20) -- become computationally infeasible, since they involve high dimensional and high precision matrix multiplication and inversion. We therefore develop new techniques that allow us to perform fast security estimation, even for FHE-size parameter sets.",

    "abstract": "Only a handful candidates for computational assumptions that imply secure key-agreement protocols (KA) are known, and even fewer are believed to be quantum safe. In this paper, we present a new hardness assumption---the worst-case hardness of a promise problem related to an interactive version of Kolmogorov Complexity.\r\nRoughly speaking, the promise problem requires telling apart tuples of strings $(\\pi,x,y)$ with relatively (w.r.t. $K(\\pi)$) low time-bounded Interactive Kolmogorov Complexity ($IK^t$), and those with relatively high Kolmogorov complexity, given the promise that $K^t(x|y)< s, K^t(y|x)< s$ and $s = log n$, and where $IK^t(\\pi;x;y)$ is defined as the length of the shortest pair of $t$-bounded TMs $(A,B)$ such that the interaction of $(Ac,Bc)$ lead to the transcript $\\pi$ and the respective outputs $x,y$.\r\n\r\nWe demonstrate that when $t$ is some polynomial, then not only does this hardness assumption imply the existence of KA, but it is also necessary for the existence of secure KA. As such, it yields the first natural hardness assumption characterizing the existence of key-agreement protocols.\r\n\r\nWe additionally show that when the threshold $s$ is bigger (e.g., $s = 55log n$), then the (worst-case) hardness of this problem instead characterizes the existence of one-way functions (OWFs). As such, our work also clarifies exactly what it would take to base KA on the existence of OWFs, and demonstrates that this question boils down to demonstrating a worst-case reduction between two closely related promise problems.",

    "abstract": "Secure two-party computation (2PC) in the RAM model has attracted huge attention in recent years. Most existing results only support semi-honest security, with the exception of Keller and Yanai (Eurocrypt 2018) with very high cost. In this paper, we propose an efficient RAM-based 2PC protocol with active security and one-bit leakage.\r\n\r\n1) We propose an actively secure protocol for distributed point function (DPF), with one-bit leakage, that is essentially as efficient as the state-of-the-art semi-honest protocol. Compared with previous work, our protocol takes about $50 \\times$ less communication for a domain with $2^{20}$ entries, and no longer requires actively secure generic 2PC.\r\n\r\n2) We extend the dual-execution protocol to allow reactive computation, and then build a RAM-based 2PC protocol with active security on top of our new building blocks. The protocol follows the paradigm of Doerner and shelat (CCS 2017). We are able to prove that the protocol has end-to-end one-bit leakage.\r\n\r\n3) Our implementation shows that our protocol is almost as efficient as the state-of-the-art semi-honest RAM-based 2PC protocol, and is at least two orders of magnitude faster than prior actively secure RAM-based 2PC without leakage, providing a realistic trade-off in practice.",

    "abstract": "Two recent proposals by Bernstein and Pornin emphasize the use of deterministic signatures in DSA and its elliptic curve-based variants. Deterministic signatures derive the required ephemeral key value in a deterministic manner from the message to be signed and the secret key instead of using random number generators. The goal is to prevent severe security issues, such as the straight-forward secret key recovery from low quality random numbers. Recent developments have raised skepticism whether e.g. embedded or pervasive devices are able to generate randomness of sufficient quality. The main concerns stem from individual implementations lacking sufficient entropy source and standardized methods for random number generation with suspected back doors. While we support the goal of deterministic signatures, we are concerned about the fact that this has a significant influence on side-channel security of implementations. Specifically, attackers will be able to mount differential side-channel attacks on the additional use of the secret key in a cryptographic hash function to derive the deterministic ephemeral key. Previously, only a simple integer arithmetic function\r\nto generate the second signature parameter had to be protected, which is rather straight-forward. Hash functions are significantly more difficult to protect. In this contribution, we systematically explain how deterministic signatures introduce this new side-channel vulnerability.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents SNOW-SCA, the first power side-channel analysis (SCA) attack of a 5G mobile communication security standard candidate, SNOW-V, running on a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller. First, we perform a generic known-key correlation (KKC) analysis to identify the leakage points. Next, a correlation power analysis (CPA) attack is performed, which reduces the attack complexity to two key guesses for each key byte. The correct secret key is then uniquely identified utilizing linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The profiled SCA attack with LDA achieves 100% accuracy after training with < 200 traces, which means the attack succeeds with just a single trace. Overall, using the combined CPA and LDA attack model, the correct secret key byte is recovered with < 50 traces collected using the ChipWhisperer platform. The entire 256-bit secret key of SNOW-V can be recovered incrementally using the proposed SCA attack. Finally, we suggest low-overhead countermeasures that can be used to prevent these SCA attacks.",

    "abstract": "Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) allows two or more parties to compute any public function over their privately-held inputs, without revealing any information beyond the result of the computation. Modern protocols for MPC generate a large amount of input-independent preprocessing material called multiplication triples, in an offline phase. This preprocessing can later be used by the parties to efficiently instantiate an input-dependent online phase computing the function.\r\n\r\nTo date, the state-of-the-art secure multi-party computation protocols in the preprocessing model are tailored to secure computation of arithmetic circuits over large fields and require little communication in the preprocessing phase, typically O(N \u00b7 m) to generate m triples among N parties. In contrast, when it comes to computing preprocessing for computations that are naturally represented as Boolean circuits, the state-of-the-art techniques have not evolved since the 1980s, and in particular, require every pair of parties to execute a large number of oblivious transfers before interacting to convert them to N-party triples, which induces an \u03a9(N^2 \u00b7 m) communication overhead.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce FOLEAGE, which addresses this gap by introducing an efficient preprocessing protocol tailored to Boolean circuits. FOLEAGE exhibits excellent performance: It generates m multiplication triples over F2 using only N \u00b7 m + O(N^2 \u00b7 log m) bits of communication for N-parties, and can concretely produce over 12 million triples per second in the 2-party setting on one core of a commodity machine. Our result builds upon an efficient Pseudorandom Correlation Generator (PCG) for multiplication triples over the field F4. Roughly speaking, a PCG enables parties to stretch a short seed into a large number of pseudorandom correlations non-interactively, which greatly improves the efficiency of the offline phase in MPC protocols. Our construction significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, which we demonstrate via a prototype implementation. This is achieved by introducing a number of protocol-level, algorithmic-level, and implementation-level optimizations on the recent PCG construction of Bombar et al. (Crypto 2023) from the Quasi-Abelian Syndrome Decoding assumption.",

    "abstract": "Zero-knowledge range proofs (ZKRPs) allow a prover to convince a verifier that a secret value lies in a given interval. ZKRPs have numerous applications: from anonymous credentials and auctions, to confidential transactions in cryptocurrencies. At the same time, a plethora of ZKRP constructions exist in the literature, each with its own trade-offs. In this work, we systematize the knowledge around ZKRPs. We create a classification of existing constructions based on the underlying building techniques, and we summarize their properties. We provide comparisons between schemes both in terms of properties as well as efficiency levels, and construct a guideline to assist in the selection of an appropriate ZKRP for different application requirements. Finally, we discuss a number of interesting open research problems.",

    "abstract": "A recent work from Eurocrypt 2023 suggests that prime-field masking has excellent potential to improve the efficiency vs. security tradeoff of masked implementations against side-channel attacks, especially in contexts where physical leakages show low noise. We pick up on the main open challenge that this seed result leads to, namely the design of an optimized prime cipher able to take advantage of this potential. Given the interest of tweakable block ciphers with cheap inverses in many leakage-resistant designs, we start by describing the FPM (Feistel for Prime Masking) family of tweakable block ciphers based on a generalized Feistel structure. We then propose a first instantiation of FPM, which we denote as small-pSquare. It builds on the recent observation that the square operation (which is non-linear in Fp) can lead to masked gadgets that are more efficient than those for multiplication, and is tailored for efficient masked implementations in hardware. We analyze the mathematical security of the FPM family of ciphers and the small-pSquare instance, trying to isolate the parts of our study that can be re-used for other instances. We additionally evaluate the implementation features of small-pSquare by comparing the efficiency vs. security tradeoff of masked FPGA circuits against those of a state-of-the art binary cipher, namely SKINNY, confirming significant gains in relevant contexts.",

    "abstract": "We study secure multiparty computation in the asynchronous setting with perfect security and optimal resilience (less than one-fourth of the participants are malicious). It has been shown that every function can be computed in this model [Ben-OR, Canetti, and Goldreich, STOC'1993]. Despite 30 years of research, all protocols in the asynchronous setting require $\\Omega(n^2C)$ communication complexity for computing a circuit with $C$ multiplication gates. In contrast, for nearly 15 years, in the synchronous setting, it has been known how to achieve $\\mathcal{O}(nC)$ communication complexity (Beerliova and Hirt; TCC 2008). The techniques for achieving  this result in the synchronous setting are not known to be sufficient for obtaining an analogous result in the asynchronous setting.  \r\n\r\nWe close this gap between synchronous and asynchronous secure computation and show the first asynchronous protocol with $\\mathcal{O}(nC)$ communication complexity for a circuit with $C$ multiplication gates. Linear overhead forms a natural barrier for general secret-sharing-based MPC protocols. Our main technical contribution is an asynchronous weak binding secret sharing that achieves rate-1 communication (i.e., $\\mathcal{O}(1)$-overhead per secret). To achieve this goal, we develop new techniques for the asynchronous setting, including the use of trivariate polynomials (as opposed to bivariate polynomials).",

    "abstract": "Introducing Small Cell Networks (SCN) has significantly improved wireless link quality, spectrum efficiency and network capacity, which has been viewed as one of the key technologies in the fifth-generation (5G) mobile network. However, this technology increases the frequency of handover (HO) procedures caused by the dense deployment of cells in the network with reduced cell coverage, bringing new security and privacy issues. The current 5G-AKA and HO protocols are vulnerable to security weaknesses, such as the lack of forward secrecy and identity confusion attacks. The high HO frequency of HOs might magnify these security and privacy concerns in the 5G mobile network. This work addresses these issues by proposing a secure privacy-preserving universal HO scheme UniHand for SCNs in 5G mobile communication. UniHand can achieve mutual authentication, strong anonymity, perfect forward secrecy, key-escrow-free and key compromise impersonation (KCI) resilience. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scheme to achieve secure, privacy-preserving universal HO with KCI resilience for roaming users in 5G environment. We demonstrate that our proposed scheme is resilient against all the essential security threats by performing a comprehensive formal security analysis and conducting relevant experiments to show the cost-effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

    "abstract": "Order-Revealing Encryption (ORE) provides a practical solution for conducting range queries over encrypted data.  Achieving a desirable privacy-efficiency tradeoff in designing ORE schemes has posed a significant challenge. At Asiacrypt 2018, Cash et al. proposed Parameter-hiding ORE (pORE), which specifically targets scenarios where the data distribution shape is known, but the underlying parameters (such as mean and variance) need to be protected. However, existing pORE constructions rely on impractical bilinear maps, limiting their real-world applicability. In this work, we propose an alternative and efficient method for constructing pORE using identification schemes. By leveraging the map-invariance property of identification schemes, we eliminate the need for pairing computations during ciphertext comparison. Specifically, we instantiate our framework with the pairing-free Schnorr identification scheme and demonstrate that our proposed pORE scheme reduces ciphertext size by approximately 31.25\\% and improves encryption and comparison efficiency by over two times compared to the current state-of-the-art pORE construction. Our work provides a more efficient alternative to existing pORE constructions and could be viewed as a step towards making pORE a viable choice for practical applications.",

    "abstract": "Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs) play a pivotal role in Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain due to their applications in secret leader election protocols. However, the original definition by Micali, Rabin and Vadhan is by itself insufficient for such applications. The primary concern is that adversaries may craft VRF key pairs with skewed output distribution, allowing them to unfairly increase their winning chances.\r\n\r\nTo address this issue David, Ga\u017ei, Kiayias and Russel (2017/573) proposed a stronger definition in the universal composability framework, while Esgin et al. (FC '21) put forward a weaker game-based one. Their proposed notions come with some limitations though. The former appears to be too strong, being seemingly impossible to instantiate without a programmable random oracle. The latter instead is not sufficient to prove security for VRF-based secret leader election schemes.\r\n\r\nIn this work we close the above gap by proposing a new security property for VRF we call unbiasability. On the one hand, our notion suffices to imply fairness in VRF-based leader elections protocols. On the other hand, we provide an efficient compiler in the plain model (with no CRS) transforming any VRF into an unbiasable one under standard assumptions. Moreover, we show folklore VRF constructions in the ROM to achieve our notion without the need to program the random oracle. As a minor contribution, we also provide a generic and efficient construction of certified 1 to 1 VRFs from any VRF.",

    "abstract": "Multi-signature schemes in pairing-free settings require multiple communication rounds, prompting efforts to reduce the number of signing rounds that need to be executed after the signers receive the message to sign. In MuSig and Bellare-Neven multi-signatures, the signing protocol does not use the message until the third (and final) signing round. This structure seemingly allows pre-processing of the first two signing rounds before the signers receive the message. However, we demonstrate that this approach compromises security and enables a polynomial time attack, which uses the algorithm of Benhamouda et al. to solve the ROS problem.",

    "abstract": "Side-channel analysis has become a cornerstone of modern hardware security evaluation for cryptographic accelerators. Recently, these techniques are also being applied in fields such as AI and Machine Learning to investigate possible threats. Security evaluations are reliant on standard test setups including commercial and open-source evaluation boards such as, SASEBO/SAKURA and ChipWhisperer. However, with shrinking design footprints and overlapping tasks on the same platforms, the quality of the side channel information as well as the speed of data capture can significantly influence security assessment. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we designed EFFLUX-F2, a hardware security evaluation board to improve the quality and speed of side-channel information capture. We also designed a measurement setup to benchmark the signal differences between target boards. Multiple experimental evaluations like noise analysis, CPA and TVLA performed on EFFLUX-F2 and competing evaluation boards showcase the significant superiority of our design in all aspects.",

    "abstract": "The threshold implementation technique has been proposed in 2006 by Nikova et al. as a countermeasure to mitigate cryptographic side-channel attacks on hardware implementations when the effect of glitches is taken into account. This technique is based on Boolean sharing (also called masking) and it was developed for securing symmetric ciphers such as AES. In 2023, Piccione et al. proposed a general construction of threshold implementations that is universal for S-boxes that are bijective vectorial Boolean function (functions from a binary vector space $\\mathbb{F}_{2}^n$ into itself). In this paper, we further generalize the construction and we propose a general theory of threshold implementations for any type of S-boxes. We investigate the case of functions (also not necessarily bijective) that are defined between two finite Abelian groups and we use the definition of threshold implementation given by Dhooghe et al. in 2019 with additive sharing. To show that this generalized notion is as useful as the one for Boolean sharing, we prove that many classical results still hold. An important tool in this theory is the notion of functional degree introduced by Aichinger and Moosbauer in 2021 which generalizes the algebraic degree of a vectorial Boolean function. We show that if $F$ has functional degree (at most) $d$ and the cardinality of the domain is divisible by the cardinality of the codomain, then $F$ admits a threshold implementation $\\mathcal{F}$ with $s\\geq d+2$ shares in input and $d+2$ shares in output. Moreover, we provide a complete overview on which are the available tools for studying the functional degree and how to represent those functions using a Integer-Valued (IV) polynomial representation. Then we apply our theory for the following applications: defining the inner product masking in our setting, providing a threshold implementation of any multiplication map, and computing the functional degree and the IV polynomial representations of the conversion maps between $\\mathbb{F}_p^n$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_{p^n}$.",

    "abstract": "Soft Analytical Side Channel Attacks (SASCA) are a powerful family of Side Channel Attacks (SCA) that allows the recovery of secret values with only a small number of traces. Their effectiveness lies in the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm, which enables efficient computation of the marginal distributions of intermediate values. Post-quantum schemes such as Kyber, and more recently, Hamming Quasi-Cyclic (HQC), have been targets of SASCA. Previous SASCA on HQC focused on Reed-Solomon (RS) codes and successfully retrieved the shared key with a high success rate for high noise levels using a single trace. In this work, we present new SASCA on HQC, where both the shared key and the secret key are targeted. Our attacks are realized on simulations. Unlike the previous SASCA, we take a closer look at the Reed-Muller (RM) code. The advantage of this choice is that the RM decoder is applied before the RS decoder, enabling attacks targeting both the secret key and shared key. We build a factor graph of the Fast Hadamard Transform (FHT) function from the HQC reference implementation of April 2023. The information recovered from BP allows us to retrieve the shared key with a single trace. In addition to the previous SASCA targeting HQC, we also manage to recover the secret key with two different chosen ciphertext attacks. One of them requires a single trace and is successful until high noise levels.",

    "abstract": "At Asiacrypt 2022, Ducas,  Postlethwaite,  Pulles, and van Woerden introduced the Lattice Isomorphism Problem for module lattices in a number field $K$ (module-LIP). In this article, we describe an algorithm solving module-LIP for modules of rank $2$ in $K^2$, when $K$ is a totally real number field. \r\nOur algorithm exploits the connection between this problem, relative norm equations and the decomposition of algebraic integers as sums of two squares. For a large class of modules (including $\\mathcal{O}_K^2$), and a large class of totally real number fields (including the maximal real subfield of cyclotomic fields) it runs in classical polynomial time in the degree of the field and the residue at 1 of the Dedekind zeta function of the field (under reasonable number theoretic assumptions).\r\nWe provide a proof-of-concept code running over the maximal real subfield of some cyclotomic fields. As a side contribution, we also provide some algorithmic and theoretical tools for the future study of the module-LIP problem.",

    "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving fields of encryption and blockchain technologies, the efficiency and security of cryptographic schemes significantly impact performance. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for continuous benchmarking in one of the most popular cryptography Rust libraries, fastcrypto. What makes our analysis unique is the realization that automated benchmarking is not just a performance monitor and optimization tool, but it can be used for cryptanalysis and innovation discovery as well. Surprisingly, benchmarks can uncover spectacular security flaws and inconsistencies in various cryptographic implementations and standards, while at the same time they can identify unique opportunities for innovation not previously known to science, such as providing a) hints for novel algorithms, b) indications for mix-and-match library functions that result in world record speeds, and c) evidences of biased or untested real world algorithm comparisons in the literature. \r\n\r\nOur approach transcends traditional benchmarking methods by identifying inconsistencies in multi-threaded code, which previously resulted in unfair comparisons. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology in identifying the fastest algorithms for specific cryptographic operations like signing, while revealing hidden performance characteristics and security flaws. The process of continuous benchmarking allowed fastcrypto to break many crypto-operations speed records in the Rust language ecosystem.\r\n\r\nA notable discovery in our research is the identification of vulnerabilities and unfair speed claims due to missing padding checks in high-performance Base64 encoding libraries. We also uncover insights into algorithmic implementations such as multi-scalar elliptic curve multiplications, which exhibit different performance gains when applied in different schemes and libraries. This was not evident in conventional benchmarking practices. Further, our analysis highlights bottlenecks in cryptographic algorithms where pre-computed tables can be strategically applied, accounting for L1 and L2 CPU cache limitations.\r\n\r\nOur benchmarking framework also reveals that certain algorithmic implementations incur additional overheads due to serialization processes, necessitating a refined `apples to apples' comparison approach. We identified unique performance patterns in some schemes, where efficiency scales with input size, aiding blockchain technologies in optimal parameter selection and data compression.\r\n\r\nCrucially, continuous benchmarking serves as a tool for ongoing audit and security assurance. Variations in performance can signal potential security issues during upgrades, such as cleptography, hardware manipulation or supply chain attacks. This was evidenced by critical private key leakage vulnerabilities we found in one of the most popular EdDSA Rust libraries. By providing a dynamic and thorough benchmarking approach, our framework empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions, enhance security measures, and optimize cryptographic operations in an ever-changing digital landscape.",

    "abstract": "Sparse binary LWE secrets are under consideration for standardization for Homomorphic Encryption and its applications to private computation. Known attacks on sparse binary LWE secrets include the sparse dual attack and the hybrid sparse dual-meet in the middle attack, which requires significant memory. In this paper, we provide a new statistical attack with low memory requirement. The attack relies on some initial parallelized lattice reduction. The key observation is that, after lattice\r\nreduction is applied to the rows of a q-ary-like embedded random matrix A, the entries with high variance are concentrated in the early columns of the extracted matrix. This allows us to separate out the \u201chard part\u201d of the LWE secret. We can first solve the sub-problem of finding the \u201ccruel\u201d bits of the secret in the early columns, and then find the remaining \u201ccool\u201d bits in linear time. We use statistical techniques to distinguish distributions to identify both the cruel and the cool bits of the secret. We provide concrete attack timings for recovering secrets in dimensions n = 256, 512, and 768. For the lattice reduction stage, we leverage recent improvements in lattice reduction (flatter) applied in parallel. We also apply our new attack in the RLWE setting for 2-power cyclotomic rings, showing that these RLWE instances are much more vulnerable to this attack than LWE.",

    "abstract": "Structure-preserving signatures (SPS) have emerged as an important cryptographic building block, as their compatibility with the Groth-Sahai (GS) NIZK framework allows to construct protocols under standard assumptions with reasonable efficiency.\r\nOver the last years there has been a significant interest in the design of threshold signature schemes. However, only very recently Crites et al. (ASIACRYPT 2023) have introduced threshold SPS (TSPS) along with a fully non-interactive construction. While this is an important step, their work comes with several limitations. With respect to the construction, they require the use of random oracles, interactive complexity assumptions and are restricted to so called indexed Diffie-Hellman message spaces. Latter limits the use of their construction as a drop-in replacement for SPS. When it comes to security, they only support static corruptions and do not allow partial signature queries for the forgery.  \r\nIn this paper, we ask whether it is possible to construct TSPS without such restrictions. We start from an SPS from Kiltz, Pan and Wee (CRYPTO 2015) which has an interesting structure, but thresholdizing it requires some modifications. Interestingly, we can prove it secure in the strongest model (TS-UF-1) for fully non-interactive threshold signatures (Bellare et al., CRYPTO 2022) and even under fully adaptive corruptions. Surprisingly, we can show the latter under a standard assumption without requiring any idealized model. All known constructions of efficient threshold signatures in the discrete logarithm setting require interactive assumptions and idealized models. \r\nConcretely, our scheme in type III bilinear groups under the SXDH assumption has signatures consisting of 7 group elements. Compared to the TSPS from Crites et al. (2 group elements), this comes at the cost of efficiency. However, our scheme is secure under standard assumptions, achieves strong and adaptive security guarantees and supports general message spaces, i.e., represents a drop-in replacement for many SPS applications. Given these features, the increase in the size of the signature seems acceptable even for practical applications.",

    "abstract": "With the ongoing advances in machine learning (ML), cybersecurity solutions and security primitives are becoming increasingly vulnerable to successful attacks. Strong physically unclonable functions (PUFs) are a potential solution for providing high resistance to such attacks. In this paper, we propose a generalized attack model that leverages multiple chips jointly to minimize the cloning error. Our analysis shows that the entropy rate over different chips is a relevant measure to the new attack model as well as the multi-bit strong PUF classes. We explain the sources of randomness that affect unpredictability and its possible measures using models of state-of-the-art strong PUFs. Moreover, we utilize min-max entropy estimators to measure the unpredictability of multi-bit strong PUF classes for the first time in the PUF community. Finally, we provide experimental results for a multi-bit strong PUF class, the hybrid Boolean network PUF, showing its high unpredictability and resistance to ML attacks.",

    "abstract": "Transport Layer Security ( TLS ) is foundational for safeguarding client-server communication. However, it does not extend integrity guarantees to third-party verification of data authenticity. If a client wants to present data obtained from a server, it cannot convince any other party that the data has not been tampered with.\r\n\r\nTLS oracles ensure data authenticity beyond the client-server TLS connection, such that clients can obtain data from a server and ensure provenance to any third party, without server-side modifications. Generally, a TLS oracle involves a third party, the verifier, in a TLS session to verify that the data obtained by the client is accurate. Existing protocols for TLS oracles are communication-heavy, as they rely on interactive protocols. We present ORIGO, a TLS oracle with constant communication. Similar to prior work, ORIGO introduces a third party in a TLS session, and provides a protocol to ensure the authenticity of data transmitted in a TLS session, without forfeiting its confidentiality. Compared to prior work, we rely on intricate details specific to TLS 1.3, which allow us to prove correct key derivation, authentication and encryption within a Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP). This, combined with optimizations for TLS 1.3, leads to an efficient protocol with constant communication in the online phase. Our work reduces online communication by $375 \\times$ and online runtime by up to $4.6 \\times$, compared to prior work.",

    "abstract": "$n$-out-of-$n$ distributed signatures are a special type of threshold $t$-out-of-$n$ signatures. They are created by a group of $n$ signers, each holding a share of the secret key, in a collaborative way. This kind of signatures has been studied intensively in recent years, motivated by different applications such as reducing the risk of compromising secret keys in cryptocurrencies. Towards maintaining security in the presence of quantum adversaries, Damg\u00e5rd et al. (J Cryptol 35(2), 2022) proposed lattice-based constructions of $n$-out-of-$n$ distributed signatures and multi-signatures following the Fiat-Shamir with aborts paradigm (ASIACRYPT 2009). Due to the inherent issue of aborts, the protocols either require to increase their parameters by a factor of $n$, or they suffer from a large number of restarts that grows with $n$. This has a significant impact on their efficiency, even if $n$ is small. Moreover, the protocols use trapdoor homomorphic commitments as a further cryptographic building block, making their deployment in practice not as easy as standard lattice-based Fiat-Shamir signatures. In this work, we present a new construction of $n$-out-of-$n$ distributed signatures. It is designed specifically for applications with small number of signers. Our construction follows the Fiat-Shamir with aborts paradigm, but solves the problem of large number of restarts without increasing the parameters by a factor of $n$ and utilizing any further cryptographic primitive. To demonstrate the practicality of our protocol, we provide a software implementation and concrete parameters aiming at 128 bits of security. Furthermore, we select concrete parameters for the construction by Damg\u00e5rd et al. and for the most recent lattice-based multi-signature scheme by Chen (CRYPTO 2023), and show that our approach provides a significant improvement in terms of all efficiency metrics. Our results also show that the multi-signature schemes by Damg\u00e5rd et al. and Chen as well as a multi-signature variant of our protocol produce signatures that are not smaller than a naive multi-signature derived from the concatenation of multiple standard signatures.",

    "abstract": "An Oblivious Pseudo-Random Function (OPRF) is a two-party protocol for jointly evaluating a Pseudo-Random Function (PRF), where a user has an input x and a server has an input k. At the end of the protocol, the user learns the evaluation of the PRF using key k at the value x, while the server learns nothing about the user's input or output. \r\n\r\nOPRFs are a prime tool for building secure authentication and key exchange from passwords, private set intersection, private information retrieval, and many other privacy-preserving systems. While classical OPRFs run as fast as a TLS Handshake, current *quantum-safe* OPRF candidates are still practically inefficient. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose a framework for constructing OPRFs from post-quantum multi-party computation. The framework captures a family of so-called \"2Hash PRFs\", which sandwich a function evaluation in between two hashes. The core of our framework is a compiler that yields an OPRF from a secure evaluation of any function that is key-collision resistant and one-more unpredictable. We instantiate this compiler by providing such functions built from Legendre symbols, and from AES encryption. We then give a case-tailored protocol for securely evaluating our Legendre-based function, built from oblivious transfer (OT) and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP). Instantiated with lattice-based OT and ZKPs, we obtain a quantum-safe OPRF that completes in 0.57 seconds, with less than 1MB of communication.",

    "abstract": "In this work we demonstrate for the first time that a full FHE bootstrapping operation can be proven using a SNARK in practice. We do so by designing an arithmetic circuit for the bootstrapping operation and prove it using plonky2. We are able to prove the circuit on an AWS Hpc7a instance in under 20 minutes. Proof size is about 200kB and verification takes less than 10ms. As the basis of our bootstrapping operation we use TFHE's programmable bootstrapping and modify it in a few places to more efficiently represent it as an arithmetic circuit (while maintaining full functionality and security). In order to achieve our results in a memory-efficient way, we take advantage of the structure of the computation and plonky2's ability to efficiently prove its own verification circuit to implement a recursion-based IVC scheme. Lastly, we present a security proof in the UC model that captures active attacks in real world applications of verifiable FHE and augment our prototype to fit such applications.",

    "abstract": "Targeted Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks have been a practical concern\r\nfor permissionless blockchains. Potential solutions, such as random\r\nsampling, are adopted by blockchains.\r\nHowever, the associated security guarantees have only been informally discussed in prior work. This\r\nis due to the fact that existing adversary models are either not\r\nfully capturing this attack or giving up certain design choices\r\n(as in the sleepy model or asynchronous network model), or too strong to\r\nbe practical (as in the mobile Byzantine adversary model).\r\n\r\nThis paper provides theoretical foundations and desired properties\r\nfor consensus protocols that resist against targeted DoS attacks. In particular, we\r\ndefine the Mobile Crash Adaptive Byzantine (MCAB) model to capture such an attack. In addition, we\r\nidentify and formalize two properties for consensus protocols under the MCAB model, and analyze their trade-offs.\r\nAs case studies, we prove that Ouroboros Praos and Algorand are secure in our MCAB model, giving the first formal proofs supporting their security guarantee against targeted DoS attacks, which were previously only informally discussed.\r\nWe also illustrate an application of our properties to secure a streamlined BFT protocol, chained Hotstuff, against targeted DoS attacks.",

    "abstract": "A function secret sharing (FSS) (Boyle et al., Eurocrypt 2015) is a cryptographic primitive that enables additive secret sharing of functions from a given function family $\\mathcal{F}$. FSS supports a wide range of cryptographic applications, including private information retrieval (PIR), anonymous messaging systems, private set intersection and more. Formally, given positive integers $r \\geq 2$ and $t < r$, and a class $\\mathcal{F}$ of functions $f: [n] \\to \\mathbb{G}$ for an Abelian group $\\mathbb{G}$, an $r$-party $t$-private FSS scheme for $\\mathcal{F}$ allows a dealer to split each $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$ into $r$ function shares $f_1, \\ldots, f_r$ among $r$ servers. Shares have the property that $f = f_1 + \\cdots + f_r$ and functions are indistinguishable for any coalition of up to $t$ servers. FSS for point function $f_{\\alpha_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_l,\\beta_1,\\ldots,\\beta_l}$ for different $\\alpha$ and $l<t$ that evaluates to $\\beta_i$ on input $\\alpha_i$ for all $i\\in[l]$ and to zero on all other inputs for $l=1$ are known under the name of distributed point functions (DPF). FSS for special interval functions $f^{<}_{\\alpha,\\beta}$ that evaluate to $\\beta$ on inputs lesser than $\\alpha$ and to zero on all other inputs are known under the name of distributed comparison functions (DCF).\r\n\r\nMost existing FSS schemes are based on the existence of one-way functions or pseudo-random generators, and as a result, hiding of function $f$ holds only against computationally bounded adversaries. Protocols employing them as building blocks are computationally secure. Several exceptions mostly focus on DPF for four, eight or $d(t+1)$ servers for positive integer $d$, and none of them provide verifiability.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose DPF for $d(t+l-1)+1$ servers, where $d$ is a positive integer, offering a better key size compared to the previously proposed DPF for $d(t+1)$ servers and DCF for $dt+1$ servers, also for positive integer $d$. We introduce their verifiable extension in which any set of servers holding $t$ keys cannot persuade us to accept the wrong value of the function. This verifiability notion differs from existing verifiable FSS schemes in the sense that we verify not only the belonging of the function to class $\\mathcal{F}$ but also the correctness of computation results. Our schemes provide a secret key size $O(n^{1/d}\\cdot s\\log(p))$ for DPF and $O(n^{1/d}\\cdot s\\log(p))$ for DCF, where $p^s$ is the size of group $\\mathbb{G}$.",

    "abstract": "Quantum Fourier Transformation (QFT)  needs to construct the rotation gates with extremely tiny angles. Since it is impossible to physically manipulate such tiny angles (corresponding to extremely weak energies), those gates should be replaced by some scaled and controllable gates.  The version of QFT is called banded QFT (BQFT),  and can be mathematically specified by Kronecker product and binary fraction. But the systemic errors of BQFT has never been heuristically estimated.  In this paper, we generate the programming code for BQFT and  argue that its systemic errors are not negligible, which means  the physical implementation of QFT with a huge transform size  is still a challenge. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to obtain the result.",

    "abstract": "Private messaging platforms provide strong protection against platform eavesdropping, but malicious users can use privacy as cover for spreading abuse and misinformation. In an attempt to identify the sources of misinformation on private platforms, researchers have proposed mechanisms to trace back the source of a user-reported message (CCS '19,'21). Unfortunately, the threat model considered by initial proposals allowed a single user to compromise the privacy of another user whose legitimate content the reporting user did not like. More recent work has attempted to mitigate this side effect by requiring a threshold number of users to report a message before its origins can be identified (NDSS '22). However, the state of the art scheme requires the introduction of new probabilistic data structures and only achieves a \"fuzzy\" threshold guarantee. Moreover, false positives, where the source of an unreported message is identified, are possible.\r\n\r\nThis paper introduces a new threshold source tracking technique that allows a private messaging platform, with the cooperation of a third-party moderator, to operate a threshold reporting scheme with exact thresholds and no false positives. Unlike prior work, our techniques require no modification of the message delivery process for a standard source tracking scheme, affecting only the abuse reporting procedure, and do not require tuning of probabilistic data structures.",

    "abstract": "We explore Zero-Knowledge proofs (ZKP) of statements expressed as programs written in high-level languages, e.g., C or assembly. At the core of executing such programs in ZK is the repeated evaluation of a CPU step, achieved by branching over the CPU\u2019s instruction set. This approach is general and covers traversal-execution of a program\u2019s control flow graph (CFG): here CPU instructions are straight-line program fragments (of various sizes) associated with the CFG nodes. This highlights the usefulness of ZK CPUs with a large number of instructions of varying sizes.\r\n\r\nWe formalize and design an efficient tight ZK CPU, where the cost (both computation and communication, for each party) of each step depends only on the instruction taken. This qualitatively improves over state-of-the-art, where cost scales with the size of the largest CPU instruction (largest CFG node).\r\n\r\nOur technique is formalized in the standard commit-and-prove paradigm, so our results are compatible with a variety of (interactive and non-interactive) general-purpose ZK.\r\n\r\nWe implemented an interactive tight arithmetic (over $\\mathbb{F}_{2^{61}-1}$) ZK CPU based on Vector Oblivious Linear Evaluation (VOLE) and compared it to the state-of-the-art non-tight VOLE-based ZK CPU Batchman (Yang et al. CCS\u201923). In our experiments, under the same hardware configuration, we achieve comparable performance when instructions are of the same size and a $5$-$18\u00d7$ improvement when instructions are of varied size. Our VOLE-based tight ZK CPU (over $\\mathbb{F}_{2^{61}-1}$) can execute $100$K (resp. $450$K) multiplication gates per second in a WAN-like (resp. LAN-like) setting. It requires \u2264 $102$ Bytes per multiplication gate. Our basic building block, ZK Unbalanced Read-Only Memory, may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Lattice-based cryptography has emerged as a promising new candidate to build cryptographic primitives. It offers resilience against quantum attacks, enables fully homomorphic encryption, and relies on robust theoretical foundations. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are an essential primitive for various privacy-preserving applications. For example, anonymous credentials, group signatures, and verifiable oblivious pseudorandom functions all require ZKPs. Currently, the majority of ZKP systems are based on elliptic curves, which are susceptible to attacks from quantum computers. This project presents the first implementation of Lantern, a state-of-the-art lattice-based ZKP system that can create compact proofs, which are a few dozen kilobytes large, for basic statements. We thoroughly explain the theory behind the scheme and give a full implementation in a Jupyter Notebook using SageMath to make Lantern more accessible to researchers. Our interactive implementation allows users to fully understand the scheme and its building blocks, providing a valuable resource to understand both ZKPs and lattice cryptography. Albeit not optimized for performance, this implementation allows us to construct a Module-LWE secret proof in 35s on a consumer laptop. Through our contributions, we aim to advance the understanding and practical utilization of lattice-based ZKP systems, particularly emphasizing accessibility for the broader research community.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we describe new quantum generic attacks on 6 rounds balanced Feistel networks with internal functions or internal permutations. In order to obtain our new quantum attacks, we revisit a result of Childs and Eisenberg that extends Ambainis' collision finding algorithm to the subset finding problem. In more details, we continue their work by carefully analyzing the time complexity of their algorithm. We also use four points structures attacks instead of two points structures attacks that leads to a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(2^{8n/5})$ instead of $\\mathcal{O}(2^{2n})$. Moreover, we have also found a classical (i.e. non quantum) improved attack on $6$ rounds with internal permutations. The complexity here will be in $\\mathcal{O}(2^{2n})$ instead of $\\mathcal{O}(2^{3n})$ previously known.",

    "abstract": "Given two elliptic curves and the degree of an isogeny between them, finding the isogeny is believed to be a difficult problem---upon which rests the security of nearly any isogeny-based scheme. If, however, to the data above we add information about the behavior of the isogeny on a large enough subgroup, the problem can become easy, as recent cryptanalyses on SIDH have shown.\r\nBetween the restriction of the isogeny to a full $N$-torsion subgroup and no ''torsion information'' at all lies a spectrum of interesting intermediate problems, raising the question of how easy or hard each of them is.  Here we explore modular isogeny problems where the torsion information is masked by the action of a group of $2\\times 2$ matrices.  We give reductions between these problems, classify them by their difficulty, and link them to security assumptions found in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Classifying images has become a straightforward and accessible task, thanks to the advent of Deep Neural Networks. Nevertheless, not much attention is given to the privacy concerns associated with sensitive data contained in images. In this study, we propose a solution to this issue by exploring an intersection between Machine Learning and cryptography. \r\nIn particular, Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) emerges as a promising solution, as it enables computations to be performed on encrypted data. We, therefore, propose a Residual Network implementation based on FHE which allows the classification of encrypted images, ensuring that only the user can see the result.\r\nWe suggest a circuit which reduces the memory requirements by more than 85% compared to the most recent works, while maintaining a high level of accuracy and a short computational time. We implement the circuit using the well-known CKKS scheme, which enables approximate encrypted computations. \r\nWe evaluate the results from three perspectives: memory requirements, computational time and calculations precision. We demonstrate that it is possible to evaluate an encrypted ResNet20 in less than five minutes on a laptop using approximately 15GB of memory, achieving an accuracy of 91.67% on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is almost equivalent to the accuracy of the plain model (92.60%).",

    "abstract": "Banks publish daily a list of available securities/assets (axe list) to selected clients to help them effectively locate Long (buy) or Short (sell) trades at reduced financing rates. This reduces costs for the bank, as the list aggregates the bank's internal firm inventory per asset for all clients of long as well as short trades. However, this is somewhat problematic: (1) the bank's inventory is revealed; (2) trades of clients who contribute to the aggregated list, particularly those deemed large, are revealed to other clients. Clients conducting sizable trades with the bank and possessing a portion of the aggregated asset exceeding $50\\%$ are considered to be concentrated clients. This could potentially reveal a trading concentrated client's activity to their competitors, thus providing an unfair advantage over the market.\r\n\r\n\r\nAtlas-X Axe Obfuscation, powered by new differential private methods, enables a bank to obfuscate its published axe list on a daily basis while under continual observation, thus maintaining an acceptable inventory Profit and Loss (P\\&L) cost pertaining to the noisy obfuscated axe list while reducing the clients' trading activity leakage. Our main differential private innovation is a differential private aggregator for streams (time series data) of both positive and negative integers under continual observation.\r\n\r\nFor the last two years, Atlas-X system has been live in production across three major regions\u2014USA, Europe, and Asia\u2014at J.P. Morgan, a major financial institution, facilitating significant profitability. To our knowledge, it is the first differential privacy solution to be deployed in the financial sector. We also report benchmarks of our algorithm based on (anonymous) real and synthetic data to showcase the quality of our obfuscation and its success in production.",

    "abstract": "We construct perfect zero-knowledge probabilistically checkable proofs (PZK-PCPs) for every language in #P. This is the first construction of a PZK-PCP for any language outside BPP. Furthermore, unlike previous constructions of (statistical) zero-knowledge PCPs, our construction simultaneously achieves non-adaptivity and zero knowledge against arbitrary (adaptive) polynomial-time malicious verifiers.\r\n\r\n    Our construction consists of a novel masked sumcheck PCP, which uses the combinatorial nullstellensatz to obtain antisymmetric structure within the hypercube and randomness outside of it.  To prove zero knowledge, we introduce the notion of locally simulatable encodings: randomised encodings in which every local view of the encoding can be efficiently sampled given a local view of the message. We show that the code arising from the sumcheck protocol (the Reed--Muller code augmented with subcube sums) admits a locally simulatable encoding. This reduces the algebraic problem of simulating our masked sumcheck to a combinatorial property of antisymmetric functions.",

    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a cryptographic primitive that allows performing arbitrary operations on encrypted data. Since the conception of the idea in [RAD78], it was considered a holy grail of cryptography. After the first construction in 2009 [Gen09], it has evolved to become a practical primitive with strong security guarantees. Most modern constructions are based on well-known lattice problems such as Learning with Errors (LWE). Besides its academic appeal, in recent years FHE has also attracted significant attention from industry, thanks to its applicability to a considerable number of real-world use-cases. An upcoming standardization effort by ISO/IEC aims to support the wider adoption of these techniques. However, one of the main challenges that standards bodies, developers, and end users usually encounter is establishing parameters. This is particularly hard in the case of FHE because the parameters are not only related to the security level of the system, but also to the type of operations that the system is able to handle. In this paper, we provide examples of parameter sets for LWE targeting particular security levels that can be used in the context of FHE constructions. We also give examples of complete FHE parameter sets, including the parameters relevant for correctness and performance, alongside those relevant for security. As an additional contribution, we survey the parameter selection support offered in open-source FHE libraries.",

    "abstract": "Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) is a cryptographic protocol that enables users with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to authenticate without revealing their identity. Thus, DAA emerged as a good privacy-enhancing solution. Current standards have security based on factorization and discrete logarithm problem making them vulnerable to quantum computer attacks. Recently, a number of lattice-based DAA has been propose in the literature to start transition to quantum-resistant cryptography. In addition to these, DAA has been adapted to Vehicle Ad-hoc NETwork system (VANETs) to offer secure vehicule-to-vehicule/infrastructure communication (V2V and V2I).  In this paper, we provide an implementation of the most advanced post-quantum DAA for VANETs. We explore the cryptographic foundations, construction methodologies, and the performance of this scheme, offering insights into their suitability for various real-world use cases.",

    "abstract": "The VOLE-in-the-Head paradigm, recently introduced by Baum et al. (Crypto 2023), is a compiler that uses SoftspokenOT (Crypto 2022) to transfer any VOLE-based designated verifier zero-knowledge protocol into a publicly verifiable zero-knowledge protocol. Together with the Fiat-Shamir transformation, a new digital signature scheme FAEST (faest.info) is proposed, and it outperforms all MPC-in-the-Head signatures.\r\nWe propose a new candidate post-quantum signature scheme from the Multivariate Quadratic (MQ) problem in the VOLE-in-the-Head framework, which significantly reduces the signature size compared to previous works. We achieve a signature size ranging from 3.5KB to 6KB for the 128-bit security level. Compared to the state-of-the-art MQ-based signature schemes and existing VOLE-in-the-Head signatures, our scheme achieves the smallest signature size (1.5 to 2 times compared to MQ-based schemes) while keeping the computational efficiency competitive.",

    "abstract": "Threshold Schnorr signatures are seeing increased adoption in practice, and offer practical defenses against single points of failure. However, one challenge with existing randomized threshold Schnorr signature schemes is that signers must carefully maintain secret state across signing rounds, while also ensuring that state is deleted after a signing session is completed. Failure to do so will result in a fatal key-recovery attack by re-use of nonces. \r\n\r\nWhile deterministic threshold Schnorr signatures that mitigate this issue exist in the literature, all prior schemes incur high complexity and performance overhead in comparison to their randomized equivalents. In this work, we seek the best of both worlds; a deterministic and stateless threshold Schnorr signature scheme that is also simple and efficient.\r\n\r\nTowards this goal, we present Arctic, a lightweight two-round threshold Schnorr signature that is deterministic, and therefore does not require participants to maintain state between signing rounds. As a building block, we formalize the notion of a Verifiable Pseudorandom Secret Sharing (VPSS) scheme, and define Shine, an efficient VPSS construction. Shine is secure when the total number of participants is at least 2t \u2212 1 and the adversary is assumed to corrupt at most t \u2212 1; i.e., in the honest majority model.\r\n\r\nWe prove that Arctic is secure under the discrete logarithm assumption in the random oracle model, similarly assuming at minimum 2t \u2212 1 number of signers and a corruption threshold of at most t \u2212 1. For moderately sized groups (i.e., when n \u2264 20), Arctic is more than an order of magnitude more efficient than prior deterministic threshold Schnorr signatures in the literature. For small groups where n \u2264 10, Arctic is three orders of magnitude more efficient.",

    "abstract": "Secure multi-party computation aims to allow a set of players to compute a given function on their secret inputs without revealing any other information than the result of the computation. In this work, we focus on the design of secure multi-party protocols for shared polynomial operations. We consider the classical model where the adversary is honest-but-curious, and where the coefficients (or any secret values) are either encrypted using an additively homomorphic encryption scheme or shared using a threshold linear secret-sharing scheme. Our protocols terminate after a constant number of rounds and minimize the number of secure multiplications. In their seminal article at PKC 2006, Mohassel and Franklin proposed constant-rounds protocols for the main operations on (shared) polynomials. In this work, we improve the fan-in multiplication of nonzero polynomials, the multi-point polynomial evaluation and the polynomial interpolation (on secret points) to reach a quasi-linear complexity (instead of quadratic in Mohassel and Franklin's work) in the degree of shared input/output polynomials. Computing with shared polynomials is a core component of designing multi-party protocols for privacy-preserving operations on private sets, like private disjointness test or private set intersection. Using our new protocols, we are able to improve the complexity of such protocols and to design the first variant which always returns a correct result.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new key exchange protocol based on the Generalised Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange. In the latter, instead of using a group-action, we consider a semigroup action. In our proposal, the semigroup is the set of oriented knots in $\\mathbb{S}^3$ with the operation of connected sum. As a semigroup action, we choose the action of the semigroup on itself through the connected sum. For the protocol to work, we need to use knot invariants, which allow us to create the shared secret key starting from the same knot represented in two different ways. In particular, we use finite type invariants. The security of the protocol is guaranteed by the hardness of decomposing knots in the semigroup.",

    "abstract": "Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based BFT protocols balance consensus efforts across different parties and maintain high throughput even when some designated parties fail. However, existing DAG-based BFT protocols exhibit long latency to commit decisions, primarily because they have a \\emph{leader} every 2 or more ``rounds''. Recent works, such as Shoal (FC'23) and Mysticeti, have deemed supporting a leader vertex in each round particularly difficult, if not impossible. Consequently, even under honest leaders, these protocols require high latency (or communication complexity) to commit the proposal submitted by the leader (leader vertex) and additional latency to commit other proposals (non-leader vertices).\r\n\r\nIn this work, we present Sailfish, the first DAG-based BFT that supports a leader vertex in each round. Under honest leaders, Sailfish maintains a commit latency of one reliable broadcast (RBC) round plus $1\\delta$  to commit the leader vertex (where $\\delta$ is the actual transmission latency of a message) and only an additional RBC round to commit non-leader vertices. We also extend Sailfish to Multi-leader Sailfish, which facilitates multiple leaders within a single round and commits all leader vertices in a round with a latency of one RBC round plus $1\\delta$. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our protocols introduce significantly lower latency overhead compared to existing DAG-based protocols, with similar throughput.",

    "abstract": "Fail-stop signatures are digital signatures that allow a signer to prove that a specific forged signature is indeed a forgery. After such a proof is published, the system can be stopped.\r\n\r\nWe introduce a new simple ECDSA fail-stop signature scheme. Our proposal is based on the minimal assumption that an adversary with a quantum computer is not able to break the (second) preimage resistance of a cryptographically-secure hash function. Our scheme is as efficient as traditional ECDSA, does not limit the number of signatures that a signer can produce, and relies on minimal security assumptions. Using our construction, the signer has minimal computational overhead in the signature producing phase and produces a signature indistinguishable from a 'regular' ECDSA signature.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation schemes are a simple yet powerful primitive that enable highly efficient constructions of incrementally verifiable computation (IVC). Unfortunately, all prior accumulation schemes rely on homomorphic vector commitments whose security is based on public-key assumptions.\r\nIt is an interesting open question to construct efficient accumulation schemes that avoid the need for such assumptions.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we answer this question affirmatively by constructing an accumulation scheme from *non-homomorphic* vector commitments which can be realized from solely symmetric-key assumptions (e.g. Merkle trees).\r\nWe overcome the need for homomorphisms by instead performing spot-checks over error-correcting encodings of the committed vectors.\r\n\r\nUnlike prior accumulation schemes, our scheme only supports a bounded number of accumulation steps.\r\nWe show that such *bounded-depth* accumulation still suffices to construct proof-carrying data (a generalization of IVC).\r\nWe also demonstrate several optimizations to our PCD construction which greatly improve concrete efficiency.",

    "abstract": "To resist the regimes of ubiquitous surveillance imposed upon us in every facet of modern life, we need technological tools that subvert surveillance systems. Unfortunately, while cryptographic tools frequently demonstrate how we can construct systems that safeguard user privacy, there is limited motivation for corporate entities engaged in surveillance to adopt these tools, as they often clash with profit incentives. This paper demonstrates how, in one particular aspect of everyday life -- customer loyalty programs -- users can subvert surveillance and attain anonymity, without necessitating any cooperation or modification in the behavior of their surveillors.\r\n\r\nWe present the CheckOut system, which allows users to coordinate large anonymity sets of shoppers to hide the identity and purchasing habits of each particular user in the crowd. CheckOut scales up and systematizes past efforts to subvert loyalty surveillance, which have been primarily ad-hoc and manual affairs where customers physically swap loyalty cards to mask their real identities. CheckOut allows increased scale while ensuring that the necessary computing infrastructure does not itself become a new centralized point of privacy failure.\r\n\r\nOf particular importance to our scheme is a protocol for loyalty programs that offer reward points, where we demonstrate how CheckOut can assist users in paying each other back for loyalty points accrued while using each others' loyalty accounts. We present two different mechanisms to facilitate redistributing rewards points, offering trade-offs in functionality, performance, and security.",

    "abstract": "In federated learning, secure aggregation (SA) protocols like Flamingo (S\\&P'23) and LERNA (ASIACRYPT'23) have achieved efficient multi-round SA in the malicious model. However, each round of their aggregation requires at least three client-server round-trip communications and lacks support for aggregation result verification. Verifiable SA schemes, such as VerSA (TDSC'21) and Eltaras et al.(TIFS'23), provide verifiable aggregation results under the security assumption that the server does not collude with any user. Nonetheless, these schemes incur high communication costs and lack support for efficient multi-round aggregation. Executing SA entirely within Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), as desined in SEAR (TDSC'22), guarantees both privacy and verifiable aggregation. However, the limited physical memory within TEE poses a significant computational bottleneck, particularly when aggregating large models or handling numerous clients.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we introduce OPSA, a multi-round one-pass secure aggregation framework based on TEE to achieve efficient communication, streamlined computation and verifiable aggregation all at once. OPSA employs a new strategy of revealing shared keys in TEE and instantiates two types of masking schemes. Furthermore, a result verification module is designed to be compatible with any type of SA protocol instantiated under the OPSA framework with weaker security assumptions. Compared with the state-of-the-art schemes, OPSA achieves a 2$\\sim$10$\\times$ speedup in multi-round aggregation while also supporting result verification simultaneously. OPSA is more friendly to scenarios with high network latency and large-scale model aggregation.",

    "abstract": "SHA2 is widely used in various traditional public key ryptosystems, post-quantum cryptography, personal identification, and network communication protocols. Therefore, ensuring its robust security is of critical importance. Several differential fault attacks based on random word fault have targeted SHA1 and SHACAL-2. However, extending such random word-based fault attacks to SHA2 proves to be much more difficult due to the increased complexity of the Boolean functions in SHA2.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, assuming random word fault, we identify distinctive differential properties within the Boolean functions of SHA2. Based on these findings, we propose a novel differential fault attack methodology that can be effectively used to recover the final message block and its corresponding initial vector in SHA2, forge HMAC-SHA2 messages, extract the key of SHACAL-2, and extend our analysis to similar algorithms such as SM3. The efficacy of these attacks is validated through rigorous simulations and theoretical deductions, illustrating that they represent a considerable threat to the security of SHA2. In simulations, our approach only requires  guessing $T$ bits of a register, where $T$ is at most $5$.  Moreover, the probability of successfully recovering a register (excluding the guessed bits) approaches 100\\% when introducing 15 faults (in 1000 instances), and the approximate probability is at least 95\\%  when $T=1$. Consequently, approximately 928 random faults are necessary to successfully execute the attack on the compression function. Furthermore, we discuss potential countermeasures, including verification and infection detection, and propose methods to determine the time and location of fault injection in practical experiments.",

    "abstract": "Multi-valued Validated Asynchronous Byzantine Agreement ($\\mathsf{MVBA}$) is one essential primitive for many distributed protocols, such as asynchronous Byzantine fault-tolerant scenarios like atomic broadcast ($\\mathsf{ABC}$), asynchronous distributed key generation, and many others. \r\nRecent efforts (Lu et al, PODC' 20) have pushed the communication complexity of  $\\mathsf{MVBA}$ to optimal $O(\\ell n + \\lambda n^2)$, which, however, heavily rely on ``heavyweight'' cryptographic tools, such as non-interactive threshold signatures. The computational cost of algebraic operations, the susceptibility to quantum attacks, and the necessity of a trusted setup associated with threshold signatures present significant remaining challenges. There is a growing interest in information-theoretic or hash-based constructions (historically called signature-free constructions). Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art hash-based $\\mathsf{MVBA}$ (Duan et al., CCS'23) incurs a large $O(\\ell n^2 + \\lambda n^3)$-bits communication, which in turn makes the hash-based $\\mathsf{MVBA}$inferior performance-wise comparing with the ``classical'' ones. Indeed, this was clearly demonstrated in our experimental evaluations.\r\n\r\nTo make hash-based $\\mathsf{MVBA}$ actually realize its full potential, in this paper, we introduce an $\\mathsf{MVBA}$ with adaptive security,  and $\\widetilde{O}(\\ell n + \\lambda n^2)$ communication, exclusively leveraging conventional hash functions. Our new $\\mathsf{MVBA}$ achieves nearly optimal communication, devoid of heavy operations, surpassing both threshold signature-based schemes and the hash-based scheme in many practical settings, as demonstrated in our experiments. For example, in scenarios with a network size of $n = 201$ and an input size of $1.75$ MB, our $\\mathsf{MVBA}$ exhibits a latency that is 81\\% lower than that of the existing hash-based $\\mathsf{MVBA}$ and 47\\% lower than the threshold signature-based $\\mathsf{MVBA}$. Our new construction also achieves optimal parameters in other metrics such as $O(1)$ rounds and $O(n^2)$ message complexity, except with a sub-optimal resilience, tolerating up to $20\\%$ Byzantine corruptions (instead of $33\\%$). Given its practical performance advantages, our new hash-based $\\mathsf{MVBA}$ naturally leads to better asynchronous distributed protocols, by simply plugging it into existing frameworks.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new approach to construct zero-knowledge large language models (zkLLM) based on the Folding technique. We first review the concept of Incrementally Verifiable Computation (IVC) and compare the IVC constructions based on SNARK and Folding. Then we discuss the necessity of Non-uniform IVC (NIVC) and present several Folding schemes that support more expressive circuits, such as SuperNova, Sangria, Origami, HyperNova, and Protostar. Based on these techniques, we propose a zkLLM design that uses a RAM machine architecture with a set of opcodes. We define corresponding constraint circuits for each opcode and describe the workflows of the prover and verifier. Finally, we provide examples of opcodes to demonstrate the circuit construction methods. Our zkLLM design achieves high efficiency and expressiveness, showing great potential for practical applications.",

    "abstract": "A verifiable delay function $\\texttt{VDF}(x,T)\\rightarrow (y,\\pi)$ maps an input $x$ and time parameter $T$ to an output $y$ together with an efficiently verifiable proof \r\n$\\pi$ certifying that $y$ was correctly computed. The function runs in $T$ sequential steps, and it should not be possible to compute $y$ much faster than that.  The only known practical VDFs use sequential squaring in groups of unknown order as the sequential function, i.e., $y=x^{2^T}$. There are two constructions for the proof of exponentiation (PoE) certifying that $y=x^{2^T}$, with Wesolowski (Eurocrypt'19) having very short proofs, but they are more expensive to compute and the soundness relies on stronger assumptions than the PoE proposed by Pietrzak (ITCS'19).\r\n\r\nA recent application of VDFs by Arun, Bonneau and Clark (Asiacrypt'22) are short-lived proofs and signatures, which are proofs and signatures which are only sound for some time $t$, but after that can be forged by anyone. For this they rely on \"watermarkable VDFs\", where the proof embeds a prover chosen watermark. To achieve stronger notions of proofs/signatures with reusable forgeability, they rely on \"zero-knowledge VDFs\", where instead of the output $y$, one just proves knowledge of this output. The existing proposals for watermarkable and zero-knowledge VDFs all build on Wesolowski's PoE, for the watermarkable VDFs there's currently no security proof. \r\n\r\nIn this work we give the first constructions that transform any PoEs in hidden order groups into watermarkable VDFs and into zkVDFs, solving an open question by Arun et al.. Unlike our watermarkable VDF, the zkVDF (required for reusable forgeability) is not very practical as the number of group elements in the proof is a security parameter. To address this, we introduce the notion of zero-knowledge proofs of sequential work (zkPoSW), a notion that relaxes zkVDFs by not requiring that the output is unique. We show that zkPoSW are sufficient to construct proofs or signatures with reusable forgeability, and construct efficient zkPoSW from any PoE, ultimately achieving short lived proofs and signatures that improve upon Arun et al's construction in several dimensions (faster forging times, weaker assumptions).\r\n\r\nA key idea underlying our constructions is to not directly construct a (watermarked or zk) proof for $y=x^{2^T}$, but instead give a (watermarked or zk) proof for the more basic statement that $x',y'$ satisfy $x'=x^r,y'=y^r$ for some $r$, together with a normal PoE for $y'=(x')^{2^T}$.",

    "abstract": "Private Information Retrieval (PIR) is a two player protocol where the client, given some query $x \\in [N]$, interacts with the server, which holds a $N$-bit string $\\textsf{DB}$, in order to privately retrieve $\\textsf{DB}[x]$. In this work, we focus on the single-server client-preprocessing model, initially proposed by Corrigan-Gibbs and Kogan (EUROCRYPT 2020), where the client and server first run a joint preprocessing algorithm, after which the client can retrieve elements from $\\textsf{DB}$ privately in time sublinear in $N$. Most known constructions of single-server client-preprocessing PIR follow one of two paradigms: They feature either (1) a linear-bandwidth offline phase where the client downloads the whole database from the server, or (2) a sublinear-bandwidth offline phase where however the server has to compute a large-depth ($\\Omega_\\lambda (N)$) circuit under fully-homomorphic encryption (FHE) in order to execute the preprocessing phase. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose $\\textsf{ThorPIR}$, a single-server client preprocessing PIR scheme which achieves both sublinear offline bandwidth (asymptotically and concretely) and a low-depth, highly parallelizable preprocessing circuit. Our main insight is to use and significantly optimize the concrete circuit-depth of a much more efficient shuffling technique needed during preprocessing, called Thorp shuffle. A Thorp shuffle satisfies a weaker security property (e.g., compared to an AES permutation) which is ``just enough'' for our construction. We estimate that with a powerful server (e.g., hundreds of thousands of GPUs),\r\n$\\textsf{ThorPIR}$'s end-to-end preprocessing time is faster than any prior work.\r\nAdditionally, compared to prior FHE-based works with sublinear bandwidth, our construction is at least around $10,000$ times faster.",

    "abstract": "The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is one of the most commonly used and analyzed encryption algorithms. In this work, we present   new combinations of some  prominent attacks on AES, achieving new records in data requirements among attacks, utilizing only $2^4$ and $2^{16}$ chosen plaintexts (CP) for 6-round and 7-round AES-192/256 respectively.   One of  our attacks   is a combination of  a meet-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack with  a square attack  mounted on 6-round AES-192/256 while  another attack combines  an MiTM attack   and an integral attack, utilizing key space partitioning technique,  on 7-round AES-192/256.   Moreover, we illustrate  that  impossible differential (ID) attacks can be viewed as the dual of MiTM attacks in certain aspects which enables us to recover the correct key using the meet-in-the-middle (MiTM) technique instead of sieving through all potential wrong keys in our ID attack. Furthermore, we introduce the constant guessing technique in the inner rounds which  significantly reduces the number of key bytes to be searched.  The time and memory complexities of  our attacks remain marginal.",

    "abstract": "Pseudo-random generators are deterministic algorithms that take in input a random secret seed and output a flow of random-looking numbers. The Knapsack generator, presented by Rueppel and Massey in 1985 is one of the many attempt at designing a pseudo-random generator that is cryptographically secure. It is based on the subset-sum problem, a variant of the Knapsack optimization problem, which is considered computationally hard.\r\n\r\nIn 2011 Simon Knellwolf et Willi Meier found a way to go around this hard problem and exhibited a weakness of this generator. In addition to be able to distinguish the outputs from the uniform distribution, they designed an algorithm that retrieves a large portion of the secret. We present here an alternate version of the attack, with similar costs, that works on the same range of parameters but retrieves a larger portion of the secret.",

    "abstract": "The elegant paradigm of Anamorphic Encryption (Persiano et al., Eurocrypt 2022) considers the question of establishing a private communication in a world controlled by a dictator. \r\nThe challenge is to allow two users, sharing some secret anamorphic key, to exchange covert messages without the dictator noticing, even when the latter has full access to the regular secret keys.  \r\nOver the last year several works considered this question and proposed constructions, novel extensions  and strengthened definitions. \r\n\r\nIn this work we make progress on the study of this primitive in three main directions. First, we show that two general and well established encryption paradigms, namely hybrid encryption and the IBE-to-CCA transform, admit very simple and natural anamorphic extensions. Next, we show that anamorphism, far from being a phenomenon isolated to \"basic\" encryption schemes, extends also to homomorphic encryption. We show that some existing homomorphic schemes, (and most notably the fully homomorphic one by Gentry, Sahai and Waters) can be made anamorphic, while retaining their homomorphic properties both with respect to the regular and the covert message.     \r\n\r\nFinally we refine the notion of anamorphic encryption by envisioning the possibility of splitting the anamorphic key into an encryption component (that only allows to encrypt covert messages) and a decryption component. This makes possible for a receiver to set up several, independent, covert channels associated with a single covert key.",

    "abstract": "Over the past ten years, there have been many attacks on symmetric constructions using the statistical properties of random functions. Initially, these attacks targeted iterated hash constructions and their combiners, developing a wide array of methods based on internal collisions and on the average behavior of iterated random functions. More recently, Gilbert et al. (EUROCRYPT 2023) introduced a forgery attack on so-called duplex-based Authenticated Encryption modes which was based on exceptional random functions, i.e., functions whose graph admits a large component with an exceptionally small cycle.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we expand the use of such functions in generic cryptanalysis with several new attacks. First, we improve the attack of Gilbert et al. from $\\mathcal{O}(2^{3c/4})$ to $\\mathcal{O}(2^{2c/3})$, where $c$ is the capacity. This new attack uses a nested pair of functions with exceptional behavior, where the second function is defined over the cycle of the first one. Next, we introduce several new generic attacks against hash combiners, notably using small cycles to improve the complexities of the best existing attacks on the XOR combiner, Zipper Hash and Hash-Twice.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, we propose the first quantum second preimage attack against Hash-Twice, reaching a quantum complexity $\\mathcal{O}(2^{3n/7})$.",

    "abstract": "The guess and determine attack is a common method in cryptanalysis. Its idea is to firstly find some variables which can deduced all remaining variables in a cipher and then traverse all values of these variables to find a solution. People usually utilize the exhausted search to find these variables. However, it is not applicable any more when the number of variables is a bit large. In this work we propose a guess and determine analysis based on set split to find as few variables as possible in the first step of guess and determine attack, which is a kind of exhausted search based on trading space for time and is more effective than the latter. \r\nFirstly we give an idea of set split in detail by introducing some conceptions such as base set, likely solution region and so on. And then we discuss how to utilize the set split to achieve a guess and determine analysis and give its specific implementation scheme. Finally, comparing it with the other two guess and determine analysis based on the exhausted search and the MILP method, we illustrate the effectiveness of our method by two ciphers Snow 2.0 and Enocoro-128v2. Our method spends about 0.000103 seconds finding a best solution of 9 variables for the former and 0.13 seconds finding a best solution of 18 variables for the latter in a personal Macbook respectively, which are better than those of both the exhausted search and the MILP method.",

    "abstract": "The use of MPC-in-the-Head (MPCitH)-based zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge (ZKPoK) to prove knowledge of a preimage of a one-way function (OWF) is a popular approach towards constructing efficient post-quantum digital signatures. Starting with the Picnic signature scheme, many optimized MPCitH signatures using a variety of (candidate) OWFs have been proposed. Recently, Baum et al. (CRYPTO 2023) showed a fundamental improvement to MPCitH, called VOLE-in-the-Head (VOLEitH), which can generically reduce the signature size by at least a factor of two without decreasing computational performance or introducing new assumptions. Based on this, they designed the FAEST signature which uses AES as the underlying OWF. However, in comparison to MPCitH, the behavior of VOLEitH when using other OWFs is still unexplored. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we improve a crucial building block of the VOLEitH and MPCitH approaches, the so-called all-but-one vector commitment, thus decreasing the signature size of VOLEitH and MPCitH signature schemes. Moreover, by introducing a small Proof of Work into the signing procedure, we can improve the parameters of VOLEitH (further decreasing signature size) without compromising the computational performance of the scheme. \r\nBased on these optimizations, we propose three VOLEitH signature schemes FAESTER, KuMQuat, and MandaRain based on AES, MQ, and Rain, respectively. We carefully explore the parameter space for these schemes and implement each, showcasing their performance with benchmarks. Our experiments show that these three signature schemes outperform MPCitH-based competitors that use comparable OWFs, in terms of both signature size and signing/verification time.",

    "abstract": "Policy-compliant signatures (PCS) are a recently introduced primitive by Badertscher et\r\nal. [TCC 2021] in which a central authority distributes secret and public keys associated with sets of attributes (e.g., nationality, affiliation with a specific department, or age) to its users. The authority also enforces a policy determining which senders can sign messages for which receivers based on a joint check of their attributes. For example, senders and receivers must have the same nationality, or only senders that are at least 18 years old can send to members of the computer science department. PCS further requires attribute-privacy \u2013 nothing about the users\u2019 attributes is revealed from their public keys and signatures apart from whether the attributes satisfy the policy or not. The policy in a PCS scheme is fixed once and for all during the setup. Therefore, a policy update requires a redistribution of all keys. This severely limits the practicality of PCS. In this work, we introduce the notion of updatable policy-compliant signatures (UPCS) extending PCS with a mechanism to efficiently update the policy without redistributing keys to all participants.\r\nWe define the notion of UPCS and provide the corresponding security definitions. We then provide a generic construction of UPCS based on digital signatures, a NIZK proof system, and a so-called secret-key two-input partially-hiding predicate encryption (2-PHPE) scheme. Unfortunately, the only known way to build the latter for general two-input predicates is using indistinguishability obfuscation. We show that the reliance on the heavy tool of 2-PHPE is inherent to build UPCS by proving that non-interactive UPCS implies 2-PHPE.\r\nTo circumvent the reliance on 2-PHPE, we consider interactive UPCS, which allows the sender and receiver to interact during the message signing procedure. In this setting, we present two schemes: the first one requires only a digital signature scheme, a NIZK proof system, and secure two-party computation. This scheme works for arbitrary policies, but requires sender and receiver to engage in a two-party computation protocol for each policy update. Our second scheme additionally requires a (single-input) predicate-encryption scheme but, in turn, only requires a single interaction between sender and receiver, independent of the updates. In contrast to 2-PHPE, single-input predicate encryption for certain predicate classes is known to exist (e.g., from pairings) under more concrete and well-understood assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Random number generators (RNGs) are notoriously hard to build and test, especially in a cryptographic setting. Although one cannot conclusively determine the quality of an RNG by testing the statistical properties of its output alone, running numerical tests is both a powerful verification tool and the only universally applicable method. In this work, we present and make available a comprehensive statistical testing environment (STE) that is based on existing statistical test suites. The STE can be parameterised to run lightweight (i.e. fast) all the way to intensive testing, which goes far beyond what is required by certification bodies. With it, we benchmark the statistical properties of several RNGs, comparing them against each other. We then present and implement a variety of post-processing methods, in the form of randomness extractors, which improve the RNG's output quality under different sets of assumptions and analyse their impact through numerical testing with the STE.",

    "abstract": "We propose Reckle trees, a new vector commitment based on succinct RECursive arguments and MerKLE trees. Reckle trees' distinguishing feature is their support for succinct batch proofs that are updatable - enabling new applications in the blockchain setting where a proof needs to be computed and efficiently maintained over a moving stream of blocks. Our technical approach is based on embedding the computation of the batch hash inside the recursive Merkle verification via a hash-based accumulator called canonical hashing. Due to this embedding, our batch proofs can be updated in logarithmic time, whenever a Merkle leaf (belonging to the batch or not) changes, by maintaining a data structure that stores previously-computed recursive proofs. Assuming enough parallelism, our batch proofs are also computable in $O(\\log n)$ parallel time - independent of the size of the batch. As a natural extension of Reckle trees, we also introduce Reckle+ trees. Reckle+ trees provide updatable and succinct proofs for certain types of Map/Reduce computations. In this setting, a prover can commit to a memory $\\mathsf{M}$ and produce a succinct proof for a Map/Reduce computation over a subset $I$ of $\\mathsf{M}$. The proof can be efficiently updated whenever $I$ or $\\mathsf{M}$ changes.\r\n\r\nWe present and experimentally evaluate two applications of Reckle+ trees, dynamic digest translation and updatable BLS aggregation. In dynamic digest translation we are maintaining a proof of equivalence between Merkle digests computed with different hash functions, e.g., one with a SNARK-friendly Poseidon and the other with a SNARK-unfriendly Keccak. In updatable BLS aggregation we maintain a proof for the correct aggregation of a $t$-aggregate BLS key, derived from a $t$-subset of a Merkle-committed set of individual BLS keys. Our evaluation using Plonky2 shows that Reckle trees and Reckle+ trees have small memory footprint, significantly outperform previous approaches in terms of updates ($10\\times$ to $15\\times$) and verification  ($4.78\\times$ to $1485\\times$) time, enable applications that were not possible before due to huge costs involved (Reckle trees are up to 200 times faster), and have similar aggregation performance with previous implementations of batch proofs.",

    "abstract": "In the common random string model, the parties executing a protocol have access to a uniformly random bit string. It is known that under standard intractability assumptions, we can realize any ideal functionality with universally composable (UC) security if a trusted common random string (CrS) setup is available. It was always a question of where this CrS should come from since the parties provably could not compute it themselves. Trust assumptions are required, so minimizing the level of such trust is a fundamentally important task. Our goal is to design a CrS setup protocol under a weakened trust assumption. We present an HW-token-based CrS setup for 2-party cryptographic protocols using a single token only. Our protocol is a UC-secure realization of ideal common random string functionality FCrS. We show the multiple-session security of the protocol and we also consider the multi-party extension of it.",

    "abstract": "This paper shows novel techniques to reduce the signature size of the code-based signature schemes MEDS and ALTEQ, by a large factor. For both schemes, the signature size is dominated by the responses for rounds with nonzero challenges, and we reduce the signature size by reducing the size of these responses. For MEDS, each of the responses consists of $m^2 + n^2$ field elements,while in our new protocol each response consists of only $2k$ ($k$ is usually chosen to be close to $m$ and $n$) field elements. For ALTEQ, each of the responses consists of $n^2$ field elements, while in our new protocol each response consists of about $\\sqrt{2} n^{3/2}$ field elements. In both underlying $\\Sigma$-protocols of the schemes, the prover generates a random isometry and sends the corresponding isometry to the verifier as the response. Instead of doing this, in our new protocols, the prover derives an isometry from some random code words and their presumed (full or partial) images. The prover sends the corresponding code words and images to the verifier as the response, so that the verifier can derive an isometry in the same way. Interestingly, it turns out that each response takes much fewer field elements to represent in this way.",

    "abstract": "Threshold signatures have recently seen a renewed interest due to applications in cryptocurrency while NIST has released a call for multi-party threshold schemes, with a deadline for submission expected for the first half of 2025. So far, all lattice-based threshold signatures requiring less than two-rounds are based on heavy tools such as (fully) homomorphic encryption (FHE) and homomorphic trapdoor commitments (HTDC). This is not unexpected considering that most efficient two-round signatures from classical assumptions either rely on idealized model such as algebraic group models or on one-more type assumptions, none of which we have a nice analogue in the lattice world.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we construct the first efficient two-round lattice-based threshold signature without relying on FHE or HTDC. It has an offline-online feature where the first round can be preprocessed without knowing message or the signer sets, effectively making the signing phase non-interactive. The signature size is small and shows great scalability. For example, even for a threshold as large as 1024 signers, we achieve a signature size roughly 11 KB. At the heart of our construction is a new lattice-based assumption called the algebraic one-more learning with errors (AOMMLWE) assumption. We believe this to be a strong inclusion to our lattice toolkits with  an independent interest. We establish the selective security of AOMMLWE based on the standard MLWE and MSIS assumptions, and provide an in depth analysis of its adaptive security, which our threshold signature is based on.",

    "abstract": "The income of companies working on data markets steadily grows year by year. Private function evaluation (PFE) is a valuable tool in solving corresponding security problems. The task of Controlled Private Function Evaluation and its relaxed version was introduced in [Horvath et.al., 2019]. In this article, we propose and examine several different approaches for such tasks with computational and information theoretical security against static corruption adversary. The latter level of security implies quantum-security. We also build known techniques and constructions into our solution where they fit into our tasks. The main cryptographic primitive, naturally related to the task is 1-out-of-n oblivious transfer. We use Secure Multiparty Computation techniques and in one of the constructions functional encryption primitive. The analysis of the computational complexity of the constructions shows that the considered tasks can efficiently be implemented, however it depends on the range of parameter values (e.g. size of database, size of the set of permitted function), the execution environment (e.g. concurrency) and of course on the level of security.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a high-performance and scalable hardware architecture designed for the Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT), a fundamental component extensively utilized in lattice-based encryption and fully homomorphic encryption schemes.\r\n\r\nThe underlying rationale behind this research is to harness the advantages of the hypercube topology. This topology serves to significantly diminish the volume of data exchanges required during each iteration of the NTT, reducing it to a complexity of $\\Omega(\\log N)$. Concurrently, it enables the parallelization of $N$ processing elements. This reduction in data exchange operations is of paramount importance. It not only facilitates the establishment of interconnections among the $N$ processing elements but also lays the foundation for the development of a high-performance NTT design. This is particularly valuable when dealing with large values of $N$.",

    "abstract": "Ciphertext-independent updatable encryption (UE) allows to rotate encryption keys and update ciphertexts via a token without the need to first download the ciphertexts. Although, syntactically, UE is a symmetric-key primitive, ciphertext-independent UE with forward secrecy and post-compromise security is known to imply public-key encryption (Alamati, Montgomery and Patranabis, CRYPTO 2019).\r\n\r\nConstructing post-quantum secure UE turns out to be a difficult task. While lattices offer the necessary homomorphic properties, the introduced noise allows only a bounded number of updates. Group actions have become an important alternative, however, their structure is limited. The only known UE scheme by Leroux and Rom\u00e9as (IACR ePrint 2022/739) uses effective triple orbital group actions which uses additional algebraic structure of CSIDH. Using an ideal cipher, similar to the group-based scheme $\\mathsf{SHINE}$ (Boyd et al., CRYPTO 2020), requires the group action to be mappable, a property that natural isogeny-based group actions do not satisfy. At the same time, other candidates based on non-commutative group actions suffer from linearity attacks.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, we explicitly ask how to construct UE from group actions that are not mappable. As a warm-up, we present $\\mathsf{BIN}\\text{-}\\mathsf{UE}$ which uses a bit-wise approach and is CPA secure based on the well-established assumption of weak pseudorandomness and in the standard model. We then construct the first actively secure UE scheme from post-quantum assumptions. Our scheme $\\mathsf{COM}\\text{-}\\mathsf{UE}$ extends $\\mathsf{BIN}\\text{-}\\mathsf{UE}$ via the Tag-then-Encrypt paradigm. We prove CCA security in the random oracle model based on a stronger computational assumption. We justify the hardness of our new assumption in the algebraic group action model.",

    "abstract": "Anonymous identity-based encryption (AIBE) is an extension of identity-based encryption (IBE) that enhances the privacy of a ciphertext by providing ciphertext anonymity. In this paper, we introduce the concept of revocable IBE with anonymous revocation (RIBE-AR), which is capable of issuing an update key and hiding the revoked set of the update key that efficiently revokes private keys of AIBE. We first define the security models of RIBE-AR and propose an efficient RIBE-AR scheme in bilinear groups. Our RIBE-AR scheme is similar to the existing RIBE scheme in terms of efficiency, but is the first RIBE scheme to provide additional ciphertext anonymity and revocation privacy. We show that our RIBE-AR scheme provides the selective message privacy, selective identity privacy, and selective revocation privacy.",

    "abstract": "In [1], two generic constructions for biometric-based non-transferable Attribute Based Credentials (biometric ABC) are presented, which offer different trade-offs between efficiency and trust assumptions. In this paper, we focus on the second scheme denoted as BioABC-ZK that tries to remove the strong (and unrealistic) trust assumption on the Reader R, and show that BioABC-ZK has a security flaw for a colluding R and Verifier V. Besides, BioABC-ZK lacks GDPR-compliance, which requires secure processing of biometrics, for instance in form of Fuzzy Extractors, as opposed to (i) storing the reference biometric template aBio in the user's mobile phone and (ii) processing of biometrics using an external untrusted R, whose foreign manufacturers are unlikely to adjust their products according to GDPR. The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we review efficient biometric ABC schemes to identify the privacy-by-design criteria for them. In view of these principles, we propose a new architecture for biometric ABC of [2] by adapting the recently introduced core/helper setting of [3]. Briefly, a user in our modified setting is composed of a constrained core device (a SIM card) inside a helper device (a smart phone with dual SIM and face recognition feature), which -as opposed to [1]- does not need to store aBio. This way, the new design provides Identity Privacy without the need for an external R and/or a dedicated hardware per user such as a biometric smart card reader or a tamper proof smart card as in current hardware-bound credential systems. Besides, the new system maintains minimal hardware requirements on the SIM card -only responsible for storing ABC and helper data-, which results in easy adoption and usability without loosing efficiency, if recently introduced key derivation scheme of [4] and the modified ABC scheme of [2] are employed together. As a result, a total overhead of 500 milliseconds to a showing of a comparable non-biometric ABC is obtained instead of the 2.1 seconds in [1] apart from the removal of computationally expensive pairings. Finally, as different from [1], auditing is achieved via Blockchain instead of proving in zero-knowledge the actual biometric matching by the user to reveal malicious behavior of R and V.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been tremendous progress in improving the communication complexity of dishonest majority MPC. In the sub-optimal corruption threshold setting, where $t<(1-\\varepsilon)\\cdot n$ for some constant $0<\\varepsilon\\leq 1/2$, the recent works Sharing Transformation (Goyal $\\textit{et al.}$, CRYPTO'22) and SuperPack (Escudero $\\textit{et al.}$, EUROCRYPT'23) presented protocols with information-theoretic online phases achieving $O(1)$ communication per multiplication gate, across all parties. However, the former assumes that their offline phase is instantiated by a trusted party, while the latter instantiates their offline phase with $\\Omega(n)$ communication per multiplication gate assuming oblivious linear evaluation (OLE) correlations. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we present a dishonest majority MPC protocol for $t< (1-\\varepsilon)\\cdot n$ with $\\widetilde{O}(1)$ total communication per multiplication gate across both the offline and online phases, or $\\widetilde{O}(|C|)$ total communication for any arithmetic circuit $C$. To do so, we securely instantiate the offline phase of Sharing Transformation, assuming some OLE correlations. The major bottleneck in instantiating the offline phases of both Sharing Transformation and SuperPack is generating random packed beaver triples of the form $[\\boldsymbol{a}], [\\boldsymbol{b}], [\\boldsymbol{c}]$, for random $\\boldsymbol{a},\\boldsymbol{b}\\in\\mathbb{F}^k$, and $\\boldsymbol{c}=\\boldsymbol{a}*\\boldsymbol{b}\\in\\mathbb{F}^k$, where $k=\\Omega(n)$ is the $\\textit{packing parameter}$. We overcome this barrier by presenting a packed beaver triple protocol with $\\widetilde{O}(n)$ total communication, or $\\widetilde{O}(1)$ communication per underlying triple.\r\n\r\nOur packed beaver triple protocol consists of two levels of randomness extraction. The first level uses a relaxation of super-invertible matrices that we introduce, called $\\textit{weakly}$ super-invertible matrices, in which sub-matrices have sufficiently high (but not necessarily full) rank. This weakening enables  matrix constructions with only $O(n)$ non-zero entries, which is a primary reason for the efficiency of our protocol. Our second level of extraction is based on the $\\textit{triple extraction}$ protocol of (Choudhury and Patra, Trans. Inform. Theory '17).",

    "abstract": "We present a succinct polynomial commitment scheme for multilinears over tiny binary fields, including that with just two elements. To achieve this, we develop two main ideas. Our first adapts Zeilberger, Chen and Fisch's BaseFold ('23) PCS to the binary setting; it uses FRI (ICALP '18)'s lesser-known binary variant, and reveals a new connection between that work and Lin, Chung and Han (FOCS '14)'s additive NTT. We moreover present a novel large-field-to-small-field compiler for polynomial commitment schemes. Using a technique we call \"ring-switching\", our compiler generically bootstraps any multilinear PCS over a large, power-of-two degree extension field into a further PCS over that field's ground field. The resulting small-field PCS lacks embedding overhead, in that its commitment cost is identical to that of the large-field scheme on each input size (measured in bits). We attain concretely small proofs for enormous binary multilinears, shrinking the proofs of Diamond and Posen ('23) by an order of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "A cryptographic accumulator is a compact data structure for representing a set of elements coming from some domain. It allows for a compact proof of membership and, in the case of a universal accumulator, non-membership of an element x in the data structure. A dynamic accumulator, furthermore, allows elements to be added to and deleted from the accumulator.\r\nPreviously known RSA-based dynamic accumulators were too slow in practice because they required that an element in the domain be represented as a prime number. Accumulators based on settings other than RSA had other drawbacks such as requiring a prohibitively large common reference string or a trapdoor, or not permitting deletions.\r\nIn this paper, we construct RSA-based dynamic accumulators that do not require that the accumulated elements be represented as primes. We also show how to aggregate membership and non-membership witnesses and batch additions and deletions. We demonstrate that, for 112-bit, 128-bit, and 192-bit security, the efficiency gains compared to previously known RSA-based accumulators are substantial, and, for the first time, make cryptographic accumulators a viable candidate for a certificate revocation mechanism as part of a WebPKI-type system. To achieve an efficient verification time for aggregated witnesses, we introduce a variant of Wesolowski\u2019s proof of exponentiation (Journal of Cryptology 2020) that does not require hashing into primes.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays Federated learning (FL) is established as one of the best techniques for collaborative machine learning. It allows a set of clients to train a common model without disclosing their sensitive and private\r\ndataset to a coordination server. The latter is in charge of the model aggregation. However, FL faces some problems, regarding the security of updates, integrity of computation and the availability of a server.\r\nIn this paper, we combine some new ideas like clients\u2019 reputation with techniques like secure aggregation using Homomorphic Encryption and verifiable secret sharing using Multi-Party Computation techniques to design a decentralized FL system that addresses the issues of  incentives, security and availability amongst others. One of the original contributions of this work is the new leader election protocol which uses a secure shuffling and is based on a proof of reputation. Indeed, we propose to select an aggregator among the clients participating to\r\nthe FL training using their reputations. That is, we estimate the reputation of each client at every FL iteration and then we select the next round aggregator from the set of clients with the best reputations. As such, we remove misbehaving clients (e.g., byzantines) from the list of clients eligible for the role of aggregation server.",

    "abstract": "The advancement of succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (SNARK) with constant proof size has significantly enhanced the efficiency and privacy of verifiable computation. Verifiable computation finds applications in distributed computing networks, particularly in scenarios where nodes cannot be generally trusted, such as blockchains. However, fully harnessing the efficiency of SNARK becomes challenging when the computing targets in the network change frequently, as the SNARK verification can involve some untrusted preprocess of the target, which is expected to be reproduced by other nodes. This problem can be addressed with two approaches: One relieves the reproduction overhead by reducing the dimensionality of preprocessing data; The other utilizes verifiable machine computation, which eliminates the dependency on preprocess at the cost of increased overhead to SNARK proving and verification. In this paper, we propose a new SNARK with constant proof size applicable to both approaches. The proposed SNARK combines the efficiency of Groth16 protocol, albeit lacking universality for new problems, and the universality of PlonK protocol, albeit with significantly larger preprocessing data dimensions. Consequently, we demonstrate that our proposed SNARK maintains the efficiency and the universality while significantly reducing the dimensionality of preprocessing data. Furthermore, our SNARK can be seamlessly applied to the verifiable machine computation, requiring a proof size smaller about four to ten times than other related works.",

    "abstract": "We present new secure multi-party computation protocols for linear algebra over a finite field, which improve the state-of-the-art in terms of security. We look at the case of \\emph{unconditional security with perfect correctness}, i.e., information-theoretic security without errors. We notably propose an expected constant-round protocol for solving systems of $m$ linear equations in $n$ variables over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ with expected complexity $O(k(n^{2.5} + m^{2.5}+n^2m^{0.5}))$ where $k > m(m+n)+1$ (complexity is measured in terms of the number of secure multiplications required). The previous proposals were not error-free: known protocols can indeed fail and thus reveal information with probability $\\Omega(\\textsf{poly}(m)/q)$.  \r\nOur protocols are simple and rely on existing computer-algebra techniques, notably the Preparata-Sarwate algorithm, a simple but poorly known ``baby-step giant-step'' method for computing the characteristic polynomial of a matrix, and techniques due to Mulmuley for error-free linear algebra in positive characteristic.",

    "abstract": "Oblivious message retrieval (OMR) allows resource-limited recipients to outsource the message retrieval process without revealing which messages are pertinent to which recipient. Its realizations in recent works leave an open problem: can an OMR scheme be both practical and provably secure against spamming attacks from malicious senders (i.e., DoS-resistant) under standard assumptions?\r\n    \r\nIn this paper, we first prove that a prior construction $\\mathsf{OMRp2}$ is DoS-resistant under a standard LWE assumption, resolving an open conjecture of prior works. Then, we present $\\mathsf{DoS\\text{-}PerfOMR}$: a provably DoS-resistant OMR construction that is 12x faster than  $\\mathsf{OMRp2}$, and (almost) matches the performance of the state-of-the-art OMR scheme that is $\\textit{not}$ DoS-resistant (proven by the attacks we show).\r\n    \r\nTo achieve this, we analyze the $\\textit{snake-eye resistance}$ property for general PKE schemes (i.e., it is hard to encrypt an identical message under two keys). We construct a new lattice-based PKE scheme: $\\mathsf{LWEmongrass}$, that is provably snake-eye resistant and has better efficiency than the PVW scheme underlying $\\mathsf{OMRp2}$. We also show that the natural candidates (e.g., RingLWE PKE) are not snake-eye resistant.\r\n    \r\nFurthermore, we show that a snake-eye resistant PKE scheme implies a robust PKE scheme, thus introducing the first robust lattice-based PKE scheme without relying on the KEM-DEM paradigm and its inherent inefficiencies.\r\n\r\nOf independent interest, we introduce two variants of LWE with side information, as components towards proving the properties of $\\mathsf{LWEmongrass}$, and reduce standard LWE to them for the parameters of interest.",

    "abstract": "We show how fixed-unitary quantum encryption schemes can be attacked in a black-box setting. We use an efficient technique to invert a unitary transformation on a quantum computer to retrieve an encrypted secret quantum state $\\ket{\\psi}$. This attack has a success rate of 100% and can be executed in constant time. We name a vulnerable scheme and suggest how to improve it to invalidate this attack. The proposed attack highlights the importance of carefully designing quantum encryption schemes to ensure their security against quantum adversaries, even in a black-box setting.",

    "abstract": "As we enter 2024, the post-quantum cryptographic algorithm Dilithium, which emerged from the National Institute of Standards and Technology post-quantum cryptography competition, has now reached the deployment stage. This paper focuses on the practical security of Dilithium. We performed practical attacks on Dilithium2 on an STM32F4 platform. Our results indicate that an attack can be executed with just two signatures within five minutes, with a single signature offering a 60% probability of recovering the private key within one hour. Specifically, we analyze the polynomial addition $z=y+\\mathbf{cs}_1$. The attack is conducted in two phases: initially applying side-channel analysis to recover the values of $y$ or $\\mathbf{cs}_1$, followed by solving an equation system of $\\mathbf{cs}_1$ with error. We introduce using Linear Regression-based profiled attack to recover $y$, leveraging the mathematical properties of adding large and small numbers, requiring only one trace to achieve a 40% success rate. In contrast, a CNN-based template attack, trained with leakage from 200 signatures, enables $\\mathbf{cs}_1$ recovery from a single trace with a 74% success rate. Further, by exploiting the constraint $z=y+\\mathbf{cs}_1$, the combined leakages of $y$ and $\\mathbf{cs}_1$ increase the success rate for $\\mathbf{cs}_1$ recovery to 92%. Additionally, we propose a constrained optimization-based residual analysis to solve the equation set $\\mathbf{cs}_1 = b$ with error. This method can function independently or as a preprocessing step in combination with Belief Propagation or  Integer Linear Programming. Experimental results show that with a 95% correctness rate in the equation set, this method can directly recover the private key $\\mathbf{s}_1$ with an 83% success rate in just five seconds. Even with a correctness rate as low as 5%, the method can still recover the private key $\\mathbf{s}_1$ in 5 minutes using the system of equations generated by about 200 signatures.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computers have the potential to solve hard problems that are nearly impossible to solve by classical computers, this has sparked a surge of research to apply quantum technology and algorithm against the cryptographic systems to evaluate for its quantum resistance. In the process of selecting post-quantum standards, NIST categorizes security levels based on the complexity that quantum computers would require to crack AES encryption (levels 1, 3 and 5) and SHA-2 or SHA-3 (levels 2 and 4). \r\n\r\nIn assessing the security strength of cryptographic algorithms against quantum threats, accurate predictions of quantum resources are crucial. Following the work of Jaques et al. in Eurocrypt 2020, NIST  estimated security levels 1, 3, and 5, corresponding to quantum circuit size for finding the key for AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256, respectively. This work has been recently followed-up by Huang et al. (Asiacrypt'22) and Liu et al. (Asiacrypt'23) among others; though the most up-to-date results are available in the work by Jang et al. (ePrint'22). However, for levels 2 and 4, which relate to the collision finding for the SHA-2 and SHA-3 hash functions, quantum attack complexities are probably not well-studied.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present novel techniques for optimizing the quantum circuit implementations for SHA-2 and SHA-3 algorithms in all the categories specified by NIST. After that, we evaluate the quantum circuits of target cryptographic hash functions for quantum collision search. Finally, we define the quantum attack complexity for levels 2 and 4, and comment on the security strength of the extended level. We present new concepts to optimize the quantum circuits at the component level and the architecture level.",

    "abstract": "Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology marks a revolutionary advancement in the field of cryptography, enabling the verification of certain information ownership without revealing any specific details. This technology, with its paradoxical yet powerful characteristics, provides a solid foundation for a wide range of applications, especially in enhancing the privacy and security of blockchain technology and other cryptographic systems. As ZKP technology increasingly becomes a part of the blockchain infrastructure, its importance for security and completeness becomes more pronounced. However, the complexity of ZKP implementation and the rapid iteration of the technology introduce various vulnerabilities, challenging the privacy and security it aims to offer.\r\n\r\nThis study focuses on the completeness, soundness, and zero-knowledge properties of ZKP to meticulously classify existing vulnerabilities and deeply explores multiple categories of vulnerabilities, including completeness issues, soundness problems, information leakage, and non-standardized cryptographic implementations. Furthermore, we propose a set of defense strategies that include a rigorous security audit process and a robust distributed network security ecosystem. This audit strategy employs a divide-and-conquer approach, segmenting the project into different levels, from the application layer to the platform-nature infrastructure layer, using threat modelling, line-by-line audit, and internal cross-review, among other means, aimed at comprehensively identifying vulnerabilities in ZKP circuits, revealing design flaws in ZKP applications, and accurately identifying inaccuracies in the integration process of ZKP primitives.",

    "abstract": "Searchable symmetric encryption has been vulnerable to inference attacks that rely on uniqueness in leakage patterns. However, many keywords in datasets lack distinctive leakage patterns, limiting the effectiveness of such attacks. The file injection attacks, initially proposed by Cash et al. (CCS 2015), have shown impressive performance with 100% accuracy and no prior knowledge requirement. Nevertheless, this attack fails to recover queries with underlying keywords not present in the injected files. To address these limitations, our research introduces a novel attack strategy called LEAP-Hierarchical Fusion Attack (LHFA) that combines the strengths of both file injection attacks and inference attacks. Before initiating keyword injection, we introduce a new approach for inert/active keyword selection. In the phase of selecting injected keywords, we focus on keywords without unique leakage patterns and recover them, leveraging their presence for document recovery. Our goal is to achieve an amplified effect in query recovery. We demonstrate a minimum query recovery rate of 1.3 queries per injected keyword with a 10% data leakage of a real-life dataset, and initiate further research to overcome challenges associated with non-distinctive keywords.",

    "abstract": "Searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) schemes provide users with the ability to perform keyword searches on encrypted databases without the need for decryption. While this functionality is advantageous, it introduces the potential for inadvertent information disclosure, thereby exposing SSE systems to various types of attacks. In this work, we introduce a new inference attack aimed at enhancing the query recovery accuracy of RefScore (presented at USENIX 2021). The proposed approach capitalizes on both similar data knowledge and an additional volume leakage as auxiliary information, facilitating the extraction of keyword matches from leaked data. Empirical evaluations conducted on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate a notable enhancement in query recovery accuracy, up to 19.5%. We also analyze the performance of the proposed attack in the presence of diverse countermeasures.",

    "abstract": "Biextensions associated to line bundles on abelian varieties allows to reinterpret the usual Weil, Tate, Ate, optimal Ate, \\ldots, pairings as monodromy pairings. We introduce a cubical arithmetic, derived from the canonical cubical torsor structure of these line bundles, to obtain an efficient arithmetic of these biextensions.\r\n\r\nThis unifies and extends Miller's standard algorithm to compute pairings along with other algorithms like elliptic nets and theta functions, and allows to adapt these algorithms to pairings on any model of abelian varieties with a polarisation $\\Phi_D$, as long as we have an explicit theorem of the square for $D$.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we give explicit formulas for the arithmetic of the biextension (and cubical torsor structure) associated to the divisor $D=2(0_E)$ on an elliptic curve. We derive very efficient pairing formulas on elliptic curves and Kummer lines. Notably for generic pairings on Montgomery curves, our cubical biextension ladder algorithm to compute pairings costs only $15M$ by bits, which as far as I know is faster than any pairing doubling formula in the literature.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel isogeny-based public key encryption (PKE) scheme named LIT-SiGamal. This is based on a LIT diagram and SiGamal. SiGamal is an isogeny-based PKE scheme that uses a commutative diagram with an auxiliary point. LIT-SiGamal uses a LIT diagram which is a commutative diagram consisting of large-degree horizontal isogenies and relatively small-degree vertical isogenies, while the original SiGamal uses a CSIDH diagram.\r\n\r\nA strength of LIT-SiGamal is efficient encryption and decryption. QFESTA is an isogeny-based PKE scheme proposed by Nakagawa and Onuki, which is a relatively efficient scheme in isogeny-based PKE schemes. In our experimentation with our proof-of-concept implementation, the computational time of the encryption of LIT-SiGamal is as efficient as that of QFESTA, and that of the decryption of LIT-SiGamal is about $5$x faster than that of QFESTA.",

    "abstract": "In their paper, Wei et al. proposed a lightweight protocol for conditional privacy-preserving authentication in VANET. The protocol aims to achieve ultra-low transmission delay and efficient system secret key (SSK) updating. Their protocol uses a signature scheme with message recovery to authenticate messages. This scheme provides security against adaptively chosen message attacks. However, our analysis reveals a critical vulnerability in the scheme. It is susceptible to replay attacks, meaning a malicious vehicle can replay a message multiple times at different timestamps. This action undermines the overall effectiveness of conditional privacy. We suggest possible solutions to address these vulnerabilities and enhance the security of VANET communication.",

This protocol is widely used in practice, where an efficient implementation of the (honest) prover algorithm is paramount. Prior work contributes highly-efficient prover algorithms for the notable special case of multilinear polynomials (and related settings). [CTY11] presents two algorithms, the first of which uses logarithmic space but runs in superlinear time; the latter runs in linear time but uses linear space.\r\nIn this short note, we present a family of prover algorithms for the multilinear sumcheck protocol that offer new time-space tradeoffs. In particular, we recover the aforementioned algorithms as special cases.\r\nMoreover, we provide an efficient implementation of the new algorithms, and our experiments show that the asymptotics translate into new concrete efficiency tradeoffs",

    "abstract": "Biometric authentication eliminates the need for users to remember secrets and serves as a convenient mechanism for user authentication. Traditional implementations of biometric-based authentication store sensitive user biometry on the server and the server becomes an attractive target of attack and a source of large-scale unintended disclosure of biometric data. To mitigate the problem, we can resort to privacy-preserving computation and store only protected biometrics on the server. While a variety of secure computation techniques is available, our analysis of privacy-preserving biometric computation and biometric authentication constructions revealed that available solutions fall short of addressing the challenges of privacy-preserving biometric authentication. Thus, in this work we put forward new constructions to address the challenges.\r\n\r\nOur solutions employ a helper server and use strong threat models, where a client is always assumed to be malicious, while the helper server can be semi-honest or malicious. We also determined that standard secure multi-party computation security definitions are insufficient to properly demonstrate security in the two-phase (enrollment and authentication) entity authentication application. We thus extend the model and formally show security in the multi-phase setting, where information can flow from one phase to another and the set of participants can change between the phases. We implement our constructions and show that they exhibit practical performance for authentication in real time.",

    "abstract": "Fischlin's transform (CRYPTO 2005) is an alternative to the Fiat-Shamir transform that enables straight-line extraction when proving knowledge. In this work we focus on the problem of using the Fischlin transform to construct UC-secure zero-knowledge from Sigma protocols, since UC security -- that guarantees security under general concurrent composition -- requires straight-line (non-rewinding) simulators. We provide a slightly simplified transform that is much easier to understand, and present algorithmic and implementation optimizations that significantly improve the running time. It appears that the main obstacles to the use of Fischlin in practice is its computational cost and implementation complexity (with multiple parameters that need to be chosen). We provide clear guidelines and a simple methodology for choosing parameters, and show that with our optimizations the running-time is far lower than expected. For just one example, on a 2023 MacBook, the cost of proving the knowledge of discrete log with Fischlin is only 0.41ms (on a single core). This is 15 times slower than plain Fiat-Shamir on the same machine, which is a significant multiple but objectively not significant in many applications. We also extend the transform so that it can be applied to batch proofs, and show how this can be much more efficient than individually proving each statement. We hope that this paper will both encourage and help practitioners implement the Fischlin transform where relevant.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new method for training decision trees and random forests using CKKS homomorphic encryption (HE) in cloud environments,  enhancing data privacy from multiple sources. The innovative Homomorphic Binary Decision Tree (HBDT) method utilizes a modified Gini Impurity index (MGI) for node splitting in encrypted data scenarios. Notably, the proposed training approach operates in a single cloud security domain without the need for decryption, addressing key challenges in privacy-preserving machine learning.\r\nWe also propose an efficient method for inference utilizing only addition for path evaluation even when both models and inputs are encrypted, achieving O(1) multiplicative depth.\r\nExperiments demonstrate that this method surpasses the previous study by Akavia et al.'s by at least 3.7 times in the speed of inference. The study also expands to privacy-preserving random forests, with GPU acceleration ensuring feasibly efficient performance in both training and inference.",

    "abstract": "In 2021, Sterner proposed a commitment scheme based on supersingular isogenies. For this scheme to be binding, one relies on a  trusted party to generate a starting supersingular elliptic curve of unknown endomorphism ring.  In fact, the knowledge of the endomorphism ring allows one to compute an endomorphism of degree a power of a given small prime. Such an endomorphism can then be split into two to obtain two different messages with the same commitment. This is the reason why one needs a curve of unknown endomorphism ring, and the only known way to generate such supersingular curves is to rely on a trusted party or on some expensive multiparty computation.  We observe that if the degree of the endomorphism in play is well chosen, then the knowledge of the endomorphism ring is not sufficient to efficiently compute such an endomorphism and in some particular cases, one can even prove that endomorphism of a certain degree do not exist. Leveraging these observations, we adapt Sterner's commitment scheme in such a way that the endomorphism ring of the starting curve can be known and public. This allows us to obtain isogeny-based commitment schemes which can be instantiated without  trusted setup requirements.",

    "abstract": "Cache side-channels are a major threat to cryptographic implementations, particularly block ciphers. Traditional manual hardening methods transform block ciphers into Boolean circuits, a practice refined since the late 90s. The only existing automatic approach based on Boolean circuits achieves security but suffers from performance issues. This paper examines the use of Lookup Tables (LUTs) for automatic hardening of block ciphers against cache side-channel attacks. We present a novel method combining LUT-based synthesis with quantitative static analysis in our HyCaMi framework. Applied to seven block cipher implementations, HyCaMi shows significant improvement in efficiency, being 9.5$\\times$ more efficient than previous methods, while effectively protecting against cache side-channel attacks. Additionally, for the first time, we explore balancing speed with security by adjusting LUT sizes, providing faster performance with slightly reduced leakage guarantees, suitable for scenarios where absolute security and speed must be balanced.",

    "abstract": "Cryptographic protocols are hard to design and prove correct, as witnessed by the ever-growing list of attacks even on protocol standards. Symbolic models of cryptography enable automated formal security proofs of such protocols against an idealized cryptographic model, which abstracts away from the algebraic properties of cryptographic schemes and thus misses attacks. Computational models of cryptography yield rigorous guarantees but support at present only interactive proofs and/or restricted classes of protocols (e.g., stateless ones). A promising approach is given by the computationally complete symbolic attacker (CCSA) model, formalized in the BC Logic, which aims at bridging and getting the best of the two worlds, obtaining cryptographic guarantees by symbolic protocol analysis. The BC Logic is supported by a recently developed interactive theorem prover, namely Squirrel, which enables machine-checked interactive security proofs, as opposed to automated ones, thus requiring expert knowledge both in the cryptographic space as well as on the reasoning side.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce the CryptoVampire cryptographic protocol verifier, which for the first time fully automates proofs of trace properties in the BC Logic. The key technical contribution is a first-order formalization of protocol properties with tailored handling of subterm relations. As such, we overcome the burden of interactive proving in higher-order logic and automatically establish soundness of cryptographic protocols using only first-order reasoning. Our first-order encoding of cryptographic protocols is challenging for various reasons. On the theoretical side, we restrict full first-order logic with cryptographic axioms to ensure that, by losing the expressivity of the higher-order BC Logic, we do not lose soundness of cryptographic protocols in our first-order encoding. On the practical side, CryptoVampire integrates dedicated proof techniques using first-order saturation algorithms and heuristics, which all together enable leveraging the state-of-the-art Vampire first-order automated theorem prover as the underlying proving engine of CryptoVampire. Our experimental results showcase the effectiveness of CryptoVampire as a standalone verifier as well as in terms of automation support for Squirrel.",

    "abstract": "The Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is a well-known machine learning algorithm, which achieves high performance and outstanding interpretability in real-world scenes such as fraud detection, online marketing and risk management. Meanwhile, two data owners can jointly train a GBDT model without disclosing their private dataset by executing secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) protocols. In this work, we propose NodeGuard, a highly efficient two party computation (2PC) framework for large-scale GBDT training and inference. NodeGuard guarantees that no sensitive intermediate results are leaked in the training and inference. The efficiency advantage of NodeGuard is achieved by applying a novel keyed bucket aggregation protocol, which optimizes the communication and computation complexity globally in the training. Additionally, we introduce a probabilistic approximate division protocol with an optimization for re-scaling, when the divisor is publicly known. Finally, we compare NodeGuard to state-of-the-art frameworks, and we show that NodeGuard is extremely efficient. It can improve the privacy preserving GBDT training performance by a factor of 5.0 to 131 in LAN and 2.7 to 457 in WAN.",

    "abstract": "In the domain of algorithm substitution attacks (ASAs), we initiate work in a new direction, namely to consider such attacks on algorithms that are public, meaning contain no secret-key material. Examples are hash functions, and verification algorithms of signature schemes and non-interactive arguments.  In what we call a PA-SA (Public-Algorithm Substitution Attack), the big-brother adversary replaces the public algorithm $f$ with a subverted algorithm, while retaining a backdoor to the latter. We consider big-brother's goal for the PA-SA to be three-fold: it desires utility (it can break an $f$-using scheme or application), undetectability (outsiders can't detect the substitution) and exclusivity (nobody other than big-brother can exploit the substitution). We start with a general setting in which $f$ is arbitrary, giving strong definitions for the three goals, and then a construction of a PA-SA that we prove meets them. We use this to derive, as applications, PA-SAs on hash functions, signature verification and verification of non-interactive arguments, exhibiting new and effective ways to subvert these. As a further application of the first two, we give a PA-SA on X.509 TLS certificates. While ASAs have been traditionally confined to exfiltrating secret keys, our work shows that they are possible and effective at subverting public functions where there are no keys to exfiltrate. Our constructions serve to help defenders and developers identify potential attacks by illustrating how they might be built.",

    "abstract": "With the growing adoption of cloud computing, the ability to store data and delegate computations to powerful and affordable cloud servers have become advantageous for both companies and individual users. However, the security of cloud computing has emerged as a significant concern. Particularly, Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) cannot assure data confidentiality and computations integrity in mission-critical applications. In this paper, we propose a confidential and verifiable delegation scheme that advances and overcomes major performance limitations of existing Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) and Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP). Secret-shared Data and delegated computations to multiple cloud servers remain completely confidential as long as there is at least one honest MPC server. Moreover, results are guaranteed to be valid even if all the participating servers are malicious. Specifically, we design an efficient protocol based on interactive proofs, such that most of the computations generating the proof can be done locally on each server. In addition, we propose a special protocol for matrix multiplication where the overhead of generating the proof is asymptotically smaller than the time to evaluate the result in MPC. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our scheme significantly outperforms prior work, with the online prover time being 1-2 orders of magnitude faster. Notably, in the matrix multiplication protocol, only a minimal 2% of the total time is spent on the proof generation. Furthermore, we conducted tests on machine learning inference tasks. We executed the protocol for a fully-connected neural network with 3 layers on the MNIST dataset and it takes 2.6 seconds to compute the inference in MPC and generate the proof, 88\u00d7 faster than prior work. We also tested the convolutional neural network of Lenet with 2 convolution layers and 3 dense layers and the running time is less than 300 seconds across three servers.",

    "abstract": "In this note we propose a variant (with four sub-variants) of the Charles--Goren--Lauter (CGL) hash function using Latt\u00e8s maps over finite fields. These maps define dynamical systems on the projective line. The underlying idea is that these maps ``hide'' the $j$-invariants in each step in the isogeny chain, similar to the Merkle--Damg\u00e5rd construction. This might circumvent the problem concerning the knowledge of the starting (or ending) curve's endomorphism ring, which is known to create collisions in the CGL hash function.    \r\n\r\nLet us, already in the abstract, preface this note by remarking that we have not done any explicit computer experiments and benchmarks (apart from a small test on the speed of computing the orbits), nor do we make any security claims. Part of the reason for this is the author's lack of competence in complexity theory and evaluation of security claims. Instead this note is only meant as a presentation of the main idea, the hope being that someone more competent will find it interesting enough to pursue further.",

    "abstract": "Timed cryptography studies primitives that retain their security only for a predetermined amount of time, such as proofs of sequential work and time-lock puzzles. This feature has proven to be useful in a large number of practical applications, e.g. randomness generation, sealed-bid auctions, and fair multi-party computation. However, the current state of affairs in timed cryptography is unsatisfactory: Virtually all efficient constructions rely on a single sequentiality assumption, namely that repeated squaring in unknown order groups cannot be parallelised. This is a single point of failure in the classical setting and is even false against quantum adversaries. \r\n\r\nIn this work we put forward a new sequentiality assumption, which essentially says that a repeated application of the standard lattice-based hash function cannot be parallelised. We provide concrete evidence of the validity of this assumption and perform some initial cryptanalysis. We also propose a new template to construct proofs of sequential work, based on lattice techniques.",

    "abstract": "The MPC-in-the-Head (MPCitH) paradigm is widely used for building post-quantum signature schemes, as it provides a versatile way to design proofs of knowledge based on hard problems. Over the years, the MPCitH landscape has changed significantly, with the most recent improvements coming from VOLE-in-the-Head (VOLEitH) and Threshold-Computation-in-the-Head (TCitH).\r\n\r\n   While a straightforward application of these frameworks already improve the existing MPCitH-based signatures, we show in this work that we can adapt the arithmetic constraints representing the underlying security assumptions (here called the modeling) to achieve smaller sizes using these new techniques.\r\n    More precisely, we explore existing modelings for the rank syndrome decoding (RSD) and MinRank problems and we introduce a new modeling, named dual support decomposition, which achieves better sizes with the VOLEitH and TCitH frameworks by minimizing the size of the witnesses.  \r\n    While this modeling is naturally more efficient than the other ones for a large set of parameters, we show that it is possible to go even further and explore new areas of parameters. With these new modeling and parameters, we obtain low-size witnesses which drastically reduces the size of the arithmetic part of the signature. \r\n    \r\n    We apply the TCitH and VOLEitH frameworks to our new modeling for both RSD and MinRank and compare our results to the NIST candidates RYDE, MiRitH, and MIRA (MPCitH-based schemes from RSD and MinRank). We also note that recent techniques optimizing the sizes of GGM trees are applicable to our schemes and further reduce the signature sizes by a few hundred bytes. We obtain signature sizes below 3.5 kB for 128 bits of security with N=256 parties (a.k.a. leaves in the GGM trees) and going as low as \u2248 2.8 kB with N=2048, for both RSD and MinRank. This represents an improvement of more than 2 kB compared to the original submissions to the 2023 NIST call for additional signatures.",

    "abstract": "At S$\\&$P 2023, a family of secure three-party computing protocols called Bicoptor was proposed by Zhou et al., which is used to compute non-linear functions in privacy preserving machine learning. In these protocols, two parties $P_0, P_1$ respectively hold the corresponding shares of the secret, while a third party $P_2$ acts as an assistant. The authors claimed that neither party in the Bicoptor can independently compromise the confidentiality of the input, intermediate, or output. In this paper, we point out that this claim is incorrect. The assistant $P_2$ can recover the secret in the DReLU protocol, which is the basis of Bicoptor. The restoration of its secret will result in the security of the remaining protocols in Bicoptor being compromised. Specifically, we provide two secret recovery attacks regarding the DReLU protocol. The first attack method belongs to a clever enumeration method, which is mainly due to the derivation of the modular equation about the secret and its share. The key of the second attack lies in solving the small integer root problem of a modular equation, as the lattices involved are only 3 or 4 dimensions, the LLL algorithm can effectively work. For the system settings selected by Bicoptor, our experiment shows that the desired secret in the DReLU protocol can be restored within one second on a personal computer. Therefore, when using cryptographic protocols in the field of privacy preserving machine learning, it is not only important to pay attention to design overhead, but also to be particularly careful of potential security threats.",

    "abstract": "Common random string model is a popular model in classical cryptography with many constructions proposed in this model. We study a quantum analogue of this model called the common Haar state model, which was also studied in an independent work by Chen, Coladangelo and Sattath (arXiv 2024). In this model, every party in the cryptographic system receives many copies of one or more i.i.d Haar states.\r\n\r\nOur main result is the construction of a statistically secure PRSG with: (a) the output length of the PRSG is strictly larger than the key size, (b) the security holds even if the adversary receives $O\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{(\\log(\\lambda))^{1.01}} \\right)$ copies of the pseudorandom state. We show the optimality of our construction by showing a matching lower bound. Our construction is simple and its analysis uses elementary techniques.",

    "abstract": "A distributed OPRF allows a client to evaluate a pseudorandom function on an input chosen by the client using a distributed key shared among multiple servers. This primitive ensures that the servers learn nothing about the input nor the output, and the client learns nothing about the key.\r\nWe present a post-quantum OPRF in a distributed server setting, which can be computed in a single round of communication between a client and the servers. \r\nThe only server-to-server communication occurs during a precomputation phase.\r\nThe algorithm is based on the Legendre PRF which can be computed from a single MPC multiplication among the servers. \r\nTo this end we propose two MPC approaches to evaluate the Legendre PRF based on replicated and optimised secret sharing, respectively. Furthermore, we propose two methods that allows us to perform MPC multiplication in an efficient way that are of independent interest.\r\nBy employing the latter, we are able to evaluate the Legendre OPRF in a fashion that is quantum secure, verifiable and secure against malicious adversaries under a threshold assumption, as well as computable in a single round of interaction.\r\nTo the best of our knowledge, our proposed  distributed OPRFs are the first post-quantum secure offering such properties.\r\nWe also provide an implementation of our protocols, and benchmark it against existing OPRF constructions.",

    "abstract": "Despite ensuring both consistency and liveness, state machine replication protocols remain vulnerable to adversaries who manipulate the transaction order. To address this, researchers have proposed order-fairness techniques that rely either on building dependency graphs between transactions, or on assigning sequence numbers to transactions. Existing protocols that handle dependency graphs suffer from sub-optimal performance, resilience, or security.\r\nOn the other hand, Pompe (OSDI '20) introduced the novel ordering notion of ordering linearizability that uses sequence numbers. However, Pompe's ordering only applies to committed transactions, opening the door to order-fairness violation when there are network delays, and vulnerability to performance downgrade when there are Byzantine attackers. A stronger notion, fair separability, was introduced to require ordering on all observed transactions. However, no implementation of fair separability exists.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce a protocol for state machine replication with fair separability ($\\mathsf{SMRFS}$); moreover, our protocol has communication complexity $\\mathcal{O}(n\\ell+\\lambda n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of processes, $\\ell$ is the input (transaction) size, and $\\lambda$ is the security parameter. This is optimal when $\\ell\\geq \\lambda n$, while previous works have cubic communication. To the best of our knowledge, $\\mathsf{SMRFS}$ is the first protocol to achieve fair separability, and the first implementation of fair ordering that has optimal communication complexity and optimal Byzantine resilience.",

    "abstract": "Nextcloud is a leading cloud storage platform with more than 20 million users.\r\nNextcloud offers an end-to-end encryption (E2EE) feature that is claimed to be able \u201cto keep extremely sensitive data fully secure even in case of a full server breach\u201d.\r\nThey also claim that the Nextcloud server \u201chas Zero Knowledge, that is, never has access to any of the data or keys in unencrypted form\u201d.\r\nThis is achieved by having encryption and decryption operations that are done using file keys that are only available to  Nextcloud clients, with those file keys being protected by a key hierarchy that ultimately relies on long passphrases known exclusively to the users.\r\n\r\nWe provide the first detailed documentation and security analysis of Nextcloud's E2EE feature. \r\nNextcloud's strong security claims motivate conducting the analysis in the setting where the server itself is considered malicious. \r\nWe present three distinct attacks against the E2EE security guarantees in this setting. \r\nEach one enables the confidentiality and integrity of all user files to be compromised. \r\nAll three attacks are fully practical and we have built proof-of-concept implementations for each. \r\nThe vulnerabilities make it trivial for a malicious Nextcloud server to access and manipulate users' data.\r\n\r\nWe have responsibly disclosed the three vulnerabilities to Nextcloud. The second and third vulnerabilities have been remediated. The first was addressed by temporarily disabling file sharing from the E2EE feature until a redesign of the feature can be made. \r\nWe reflect on broader lessons that can be learned for designers of E2EE systems.",

    "abstract": "In this work we formalize the notion of a two-party permutation correlation $(A, B), (C, \\pi)$ s.t. $\\pi(A)=B+C$ for a random permutation $\\pi$ of $n$ elements and vectors $A,B,C\\in \\mathbb{F}^n$. This correlation can be viewed as an abstraction and generalization of the Chase et al. (Asiacrypt 2020) share translation protocol. We give a systematization of knowledge for how such a permutation correlation can be derandomized to allow the parties to perform a wide range of oblivious permutations of secret-shared data. This systematization immediately enables the translation of various popular honest-majority  protocols to be efficiently instantiated in the two-party setting, e.g. collaborative filtering, sorting, database joins, graph algorithms, and many more.\r\n\r\nWe give two novel protocols for efficiently generating a random permutation correlation. The first uses MPC-friendly PRFs to generate a correlation of $n$ elements, each of size $\\ell=\\log|\\mathbb{F}|$ bits, with $O(n\\ell)$ bit-OTs, time, communication, and only three rounds. Similar asymptotics previously required relatively expensive public-key cryptography, e.g. Paillier or LWE. Our protocol implementation for  $n=2^{20},\\ell=128$ requires just 7 seconds & $\\sim2\\ell n$ bits of communication, a respective 40 & $1.1\\times$ improvement on the LWE solution of Juvekar at al. (CCS 2018). The second protocol is based on pseudo-random correlation generators and achieves an overhead that is sublinear in the string length $\\ell$, i.e. the communication and number of OTs is $O(n\\log \\ell)$. The overhead of the latter protocol has larger hidden constants, and therefore is more efficient only when long strings are permuted, e.g. in graph algorithms. \r\n\r\nFinally, we present a suite of highly efficient protocols based on permutations for performing various batched random access operations. These include the ability to extract a hidden subset of a secret-shared list. More generally, we give ORAM-like protocols for obliviously reading and writing from a list in a batched manner. We argue that this suite of batched random access protocols should be a first class primitive in the MPC practitioner's toolbox.",

    "abstract": "We present a solution to the open problem of designing a linear-time, unbiased and timing attack-resistant shuffling algorithm for fixed-weight sampling. Although it can be implemented without timing leakages of secret data in any architecture, we illustrate with ARMv7-M and ARMv8-A implementations; for the latter, we take advantage of architectural features such as NEON and conditional instructions, which are representative of features available on architectures targeting similar systems, such as Intel. Our proposed algorithm improves asymptotically upon the current approach based on constant-time sorting networks ($O(n)$ versus $O(n \\log^2 n)$), and an implementation of the new algorithm applied to NTRU is also faster in practice, by a factor of up to $6.91\\ (591\\%)$ on ARMv8-A cores and $12.89\\ (1189\\%)$ on the Cortex-M4; it also requires fewer uniform random bits. This translates into performance improvements for NTRU encapsulation, compared to state-of-the-art implementations, of up to 50\\% on ARMv8-A cores and 72\\% on the Cortex-M4, and small improvements to key generation (up to 2.7\\% on ARMv8-A cores and 6.1\\% on the Cortex-M4), with negligible impact on code size and a slight improvement in RAM usage for the Cortex-M4.",

    "abstract": "FUTURE is a recently proposed lightweight block cipher that achieved a remarkable hardware performance due to careful design decisions. FUTURE is an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)-like Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN) with 10 rounds, whose round function consists of four components, i.e., SubCell, MixColumn, ShiftRow and AddRoundKey. Unlike AES, it is a 64-bit-size block cipher with a 128-bit secret key, and the state can be arranged into 16 cells. Therefore, the operations of FUTURE including its S-box is defined over $\\mathbb{F}_2^4$. The previous studies have shown that the integral properties of 4-bit S-boxes are usually weaker than larger-size S-boxes, thus the number of rounds of FUTURE, i.e., 10 rounds only, might be too aggressive to provide enough resistance against integral cryptanalysis. \r\nIn this paper, we mount the integral cryptanalysis on FUTURE. With state-of-the-art detection techniques, we identify several integral distinguishers of 7 rounds of FUTURE. By extending this 7-round distinguisher by 3 forward rounds, we manage to recover all the 128 bits secret keys from the full FUTURE cipher without the full codebook for the first time. To further achieve better time complexity, we also present a key recovery attack on full FUTURE with full codebook. Both attacks have better time complexity than existing results.",

    "abstract": "MRAE security is an important goal for many AEAD applications where the nonce uniqueness cannot be maintained and security risks are significant. However, MRAE schemes can be quite expensive. Two of the SoTA MRAE-secure schemes; Deoxys-II and AES-GCM-SIV rely on internal parallelism and special instructions to achieve competitive performance. However, they both suffer from the same bottleneck, they have at least one call to the underlying primitive that cannot be parallelized to any other call. Romulus-M and LMDAE are two other more recent MRAE secure schemes based on TBCs that target low area hardware. However, they are unparallelizable so they are slower than their counterparts.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present two new AEAD modes and four instantiations based on Tweakable Block Ciphers. These new modes target equipping high-speed applications on parallel platforms with nonce misuse resistant AEAD (MRAE). The first mode, LLSIV, targets similar performance on single-core platforms to SCT-2, while eliminating the bottlenecks that make SCT-2 not fully parallelizable. The enhanced parallelism allows LLSIV to encrypt significantly more blocks on parallel platforms, compared to SCT-2, in the same amount of time. LLSIV is based on the NaT MAC, where each ciphertext block can itself be viewed as an instance of NaT when the plaintext is prepended with \r\n. The trade-off is that LLSIV requires the inverse function of the TBC. However, the inverse function is used only once per message and we demonstrate that for parallel implementations it represents a very small overhead. \r\n\r\nWe give an instantiation of LLSIV based on the SKINNY-128-384 TBC, and a pruned scheme, dubbed pLLSIV, which targets enhanced performance compared both SCT-2 and LLSIV on all platforms, while having reduced security claims. It relies on the recently popularized prove-then-prune methodology to take full advantage of the properties of LLSIV. This leads to a significant performance improvement, making pLLSIV even faster than online TBC-based schemes that are not MRAE-secure. Last but not least, we give an instantiation that uses the primitives used in AES-GCM-SIV: the PolyVal hash function and AES. Our instantiation is faster than AES-GCM-SIV on all platforms and have better bounds. On the other hand, it relies on the ideal cipher model as it uses the ICE TBC proposed as part of the Remus AEAD design.\r\n\r\nThe second mode we describe is LLDFV. It uses ideas from LLSIV combined the Decryption-Fast SIV (DFV) framework proposed recently by Minematsu. The goal is to reduce the number of calls to the TBC by one, while making the scheme as parallelizable as LLSIV. This makes the scheme faster that DFV on all platforms.",

    "abstract": "Fault attacks that exploit the propagation of effective/ineffective faults present a richer attack surface than Differential Fault Attacks, in the sense that the adversary depends on a single bit of information to eventually leak secret cryptographic material. In the recent past, a number of propagation-based fault attacks on Lattice-based Key Encapsulation Mechanisms have been proposed; many of which have no known countermeasures. In this work, we propose an orthogonal countermeasure principle that does not follow adhoc strategies (like shuffling operations on secret coefficients), but rather depends on cryptographically-backed guarantees to provide quantifiable defence against aforementioned fault attacks. Concretely, we propose a framework that uses rejection sampling (which has been traditionally used as alternatives to trapdoors) to convert otherwise deterministic algorithms to probabilistic ones. Our specific goals allow careful selection of distributions such that our framework functions with a constant number of retries (around $2-3$) for unfaulted executions. In other words, should a fault be injected, the probability of success is negligible; for correct execution however, the probability of success is overwhelmingly high. Using our framework, we hence enable probabilistic decryptions in Kyber, NewHope, and Masked Kyber, and completely cut-off fault propagation in known attacks on these constructions, allowing a sound defence against known fault attacks in literature.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an in-depth exploration of the development and deployment of a Layer 1 (L1) blockchain designed to underpin metaverse experiences. As the digital and physical realms become increasingly intertwined, the metaverse emerges as a frontier for innovation, demanding robust, scalable, and secure infrastructure. The core of our investigation centers around the challenges and insights gained from constructing a blockchain framework capable of supporting the vast, dynamic environments of the metaverse. Through the development process, we identified key areas of focus: interoperability, performance and scalability, cost, identity, privacy, security, and accessibility.\r\n\r\nOur findings indicate that most challenges can be effectively addressed through the implementation of cryptography and subnets (i.e., Avalanche architecture), which allow for segmented, optimized environments within the broader metaverse ecosystem. This approach not only enhances performance but also provides a flexible framework for managing the diverse needs of metaverse applications.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a new framework for constructing linkable ring signatures (LRS). Our framework is based purely on signatures of knowledge (SoK) which allows one to issue signatures on behalf of any NP-statement using the corresponding witness. Our framework enjoys the following advantages: (1) the security of the resulting LRS depends only on the security of the underlying SoK; (2) the resulting LRS naturally supports online/offline signing (resp. verification), where the output of the offline signing (resp. verification) can be re-used across signatures of the same ring. For a ring size $n$, our framework requires an SoK of the NP statement with size $\\log n$. \r\n\r\nTo instantiate our framework, we adapt the well-known post-quantum secure non-interactive argument of knowledge (NIAoK), ethSTARK, into an SoK. This SoK is inherently post-quantum secure and has a signature size poly-logarithmic in the size of the NP statement. Thus, our resulting LRS has a signature size of $O(\\text{polylog}(\\log n))$. By comparison, existing post-quantum ring signatures, regardless of linkability considerations, have signature sizes of $O(\\log n)$ at best. Furthermore, leveraging online/offline verification, part of the verification of signatures on the same ring can be shared, resulting in a state-of-the-art amortized verification cost of $O(\\text{polylog}(\\log n))$. \r\n\r\nOur LRS also performs favourably against existing schemes in practical scenarios. Concretely, our scheme has the smallest signature size among all post-quantum linkable ring signatures with non-slanderability for ring size larger than $32$. In our experiment, at $128$-bit security and ring size of $1024$, our LRS has a size of $29$KB, and an amortized verification cost of $0.3$ ms, surpassing the state-of-the-art by a significant margin. Even without considering amortization, the verification time for a single signature is $128$ ms, comparable to those featuring linear signature size. A similar performance advantage can also be seen at signing. Furthermore, our LRS has extremely short public keys ($32$ bytes), while public keys of existing constructions are in the order of kilobytes.",

    "abstract": "Structured Encryption (StE) enables a client to securely store and query data stored on an untrusted server. Recent constructions of StE have moved beyond basic queries, and now support large subsets of SQL. However, the security of these constructions is poorly understood, and no systematic analysis has been performed.\r\n\r\nWe address this by providing the first leakage-abuse attacks against StE for SQL schemes. Our attacks can be run by a passive adversary on a server with access to some information about the distribution of underlying data, a common model in prior work. They achieve partial query recovery against select operations and partial plaintext recovery against join operations. We prove the optimality and near-optimality of two new attacks, in a Bayesian inference framework. We complement our theoretical results with an empirical investigation testing the performance of our attacks against real-world data and show they can successfully recover a substantial proportion of queries and plaintexts.\r\n\r\nIn addition to our new attacks, we provide proofs showing that the conditional optimality of a previously proposed leakage-abuse attack and that inference against join operations is NP-hard in general.",

    "abstract": "We show a polynomial time quantum algorithm for solving the learning with errors problem (LWE) with certain polynomial modulus-noise ratios. Combining with the reductions from lattice problems to LWE shown by Regev [J.ACM 2009], we obtain polynomial time quantum algorithms for solving the decisional shortest vector problem (GapSVP) and the shortest independent vector problem (SIVP) for all $n$-dimensional lattices within approximation factors of $\\tilde{\\Omega}(n^{4.5})$. Previously, no polynomial or even subexponential time quantum algorithms were known for solving GapSVP or SIVP for all lattices within any polynomial approximation factors.\r\n\r\nTo develop a quantum algorithm for solving LWE, we mainly introduce two new techniques. First, we introduce Gaussian functions with complex variances in the design of quantum algorithms. In particular, we exploit the feature of the Karst wave in the discrete Fourier transform of complex Gaussian functions. Second, we use windowed quantum Fourier transform with complex Gaussian windows, which allows us to combine the information from both time and frequency domains. Using those techniques, we first convert the LWE instance into quantum states with purely imaginary Gaussian amplitudes, then convert purely imaginary Gaussian states into classical linear equations over the LWE secret and error terms, and finally solve the linear system of equations using Gaussian elimination. This gives a polynomial time quantum algorithm for solving LWE.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing user data while protecting the privacy of individuals remains a big challenge. Trusted execution environments (TEEs) are a possible solution as they protect processes and Virtual Machines (VMs) against malicious hosts. However, TEEs can leak access patterns to code and to the data being processed. Furthermore, when data is stored in a TEE database, the data volume required to answer a query is another unwanted side channel that contains sensitive information. Both types of information leaks, access patterns and volume patterns, allow for database reconstruction attacks.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present Menhir, an oblivious TEE database that hides access patterns with ORAM guarantees and volume patterns through differential privacy. The database allows range and point queries with SQL-like WHERE-clauses. It builds on the state-of-the-art oblivious AVL tree construction Oblix (S&P'18), which by itself does not protect against volume leakage. We show how volume leakage can be exploited in range queries and improve the construction to mitigate this type of attack. We prove the correctness and obliviousness of Menhir. Our evaluation shows that our approach is feasible and scales well with the number of rows and columns in the database.",

    "abstract": "Hash chain based password systems are a useful way to guarantee authentication with one-time passwords. The core idea is specified in RFC 1760 as S/Key. At CCS 2017, Kogan et al. introduced T/Key, an improved password system where one-time passwords are only valid for a limited time period. They proved security of their construction in the random oracle model under a basic modeling of the adversary. In this work, we make various advances in the analysis and instantiation of hash chain based password systems. Firstly, we describe a slight generalization called U/Key that allows for more flexibility in the instantiation and analysis, and we develop a security model that refines the adversarial strength into offline and online complexity, that can be used beyond the random oracle model, and that allows to argue multi-user security directly. Secondly, we derive a new security proof of U/Key in the random oracle model, as well as dedicated and tighter security proofs of U/Key instantiated with a sponge construction and a truncated permutation. These dedicated security proofs, in turn, solve a problem of understanding the preimage resistance of a cascaded evaluation of the sponge construction. When applied to T/Key, these results improve significantly over the earlier results: whereas the originally suggested instantiation using SHA-256  uses a compression function that maps 768 bits into 256 bits, with a truncated permutation construction one can generically achieve 128 bits of security already with a permutation of size 256 bits.",

    "abstract": "Side-channel analysis is an important part of the security evaluations of hardware components and more specifically of those that include cryptographic algorithms. Profiling attacks are among the most powerful attacks as they assume the attacker has access to a clone device of the one under attack. Using the clone device allows the attacker to make a profile of physical leakages linked to the execution of algorithms. This work focuses on the characteristics of this profile and the information that can be extracted from its application to the attack traces. More specifically, looking at unsuccessful attacks, it shows that by carefully ordering the attack traces used and limiting their number, better results can be achieved with the same profile. Using this method allows us to consider the classical attack method, i.e. where the traces are randomly ordered, as the worst case scenario. The best case scenario is when the attacker is able to successfully order and select the best attack traces. A method for identifying efficient ordering when using deep learning models as profiles is also provided. A new loss function \"Scoring loss\" is dedicated to training machine learning models that give a score to the attack prediction and the score can be used to order the predictions.",

    "abstract": "Running machine learning algorithms on encrypted data is a way forward to marry functionality needs common in industry with the important concerns for privacy when working with potentially sensitive data. While there is already a growing field on this topic and a variety of protocols, mostly employing fully homomorphic encryption or performing secure multiparty computation (MPC), we are the first to propose a protocol that makes use of a specialized encryption scheme that allows to do secure comparisons on ciphertexts and update these ciphertexts to be encryptions of the same plaintexts but under a new key. We call this notion Updatable Order-Revealing Encryption (uORE) and provide a secure construction using a key-homomorphic pseudorandom function.\r\nIn a second step, we use this scheme to construct an efficient three-round protocol between two parties to compute a decision tree (or forest) on labeled data provided by both parties. The protocol is in the passively-secure setting and has some leakage on the data that arises from the comparison function on the ciphertexts. We motivate how our protocol can be compiled into an actively-secure protocol with less leakage using secure enclaves, in a graceful degradation manner, e.g. falling back to the uORE leakage, if the enclave becomes fully transparent. We also analyze the leakage of this approach, giving an upper bound on the leaked information. Analyzing the performance of our protocol shows that this approach allows us to be much more efficient (especially w.r.t. the number of rounds) than current MPC-based approaches, hence allowing for an interesting trade-off between security and performance.",

    "abstract": "Adaptor signatures can be viewed as a generalized form of the standard digital signature schemes where a secret randomness is hidden within a signature. Adaptor signatures are a recent cryptographic primitive and are becoming an important tool for blockchain applications such as cryptocurrencies to reduce on-chain costs, improve fungibility, and contribute to off-chain forms of payment in payment-channel networks, payment-channel hubs, and atomic swaps. However, currently used adaptor signature constructions are vulnerable to quantum adversaries due to Shor's algorithm. In this work, we introduce $\\mathsf{SQIAsignHD}$, a new quantum-resistant adaptor signature scheme based on isogenies of supersingular elliptic curves, using SQIsignHD - as the underlying signature scheme - and exploiting the idea of the artificial orientation on the supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, SIDH, as the underlying hard relation. We, furthermore, show that our scheme is secure in the Quantum Random Oracle Model (QROM).",

    "abstract": "We present a scheme to prove, in zero-knowledge (ZK), the correct parsing of a string in context-free grammar (CFG). This is a crucial step towards applications such as proving statements about web API responses in ZK.\r\n\r\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first ZK scheme to prove the correctness of CFG parsing with complexity linear in the length of the string. Further, our algorithm flexibly accommodates different ZK proof systems. We demonstrate this flexibility with multiple implementations using both non-interactive and interactive proof paradigms.\r\n\r\nGiven general-purpose ZK programming frameworks, our implementations are not only compact (e.g., around 200 lines of code for the non-interactive version) but also deliver competitive performance. In the non-interactive setting, proving the correct parsing of a $\\approx 1$KB string takes 24 seconds, even for grammars with $2^{10}$ production rules. In the interactive setting the same proof takes just 1.6 seconds.",

    "abstract": "In this note we review the technique proposed at ToSC 2018 by Sadeghi et al. for attacks built upon several related-tweakey impossible differential trails. We show that the initial encryption queries are improper and lead the authors to misevaluate a filtering value in the key recovery phase. We identified 4 other papers (from Eurocrypt, DCC, and 2 from ToSC) that follow on the results of Sadeghi et al., and in three of them the flawed technique was reused.\r\n\r\nWe thus present a careful analysis of these types of attacks and give generic complexity formulas similar to the ones proposed by Boura et al. at Asiacrypt 2014. \r\nWe apply these to the aforementioned papers and provide patched versions of their attacks. The main consequence is an increase in the memory complexity. We show that in many cases (a notable exception being quantum impossible differentials) it is possible to recover the numeric time estimates of the flawed analysis, and in all cases we were able to build a correct attack reaching the same number of rounds.",

    "abstract": "Let $\\star: G \\times X \\rightarrow X$ be the action of a group $G$ of size $N=|G|$ on a set $X$. Let $y = g \\star x \\in X$ be a  group action dlog instance, where our goal is to compute the unknown group element $g \\in G$ from the known set elements $x,y \\in X$. \r\nThe Galbraith-Hess-Smart (GHS) collision finding algorithm solves the group action dlog in $N^{\\frac 1 2}$ steps with polynomial memory. \r\n    \r\nWe show that group action dlogs are suitable for precomputation attacks. More precisely, for any $s,t$ our precomputation algorithm computes  within $st$ steps a hint of space complexity $s$, which allows to solve any group action dlog in an online phase within $t$ steps. A typical instantiation is $s=t=N^{\\frac 1 3}$, which gives precomputation time $N^{\\frac 2 3}$ and space $N^{\\frac 1 3}$, and online time only $N^{\\frac 1 3}$.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we show that solving  multiple group action dlog instances $y_1, \\ldots , y_m$ allows for speedups. Namely, our collision finding algorithm solves $m$ group action dlogs in $\\sqrt{m}N^{\\frac 1 2}$ steps, instead of the straight-forward $mN^{\\frac 1 2}$ steps required for running $m$ times GHS. \r\nInterestingly, our multi instance algorithm (with precomputation) can be seen as a special case of our precomputation algorithm. \r\nOur multiple instance approach can be freely combined with our precomputations, allowing for a variety of tradeoffs.\r\n\r\nTechnically, our precomputation and multiple instance group action dlog attacks are adaptations of the techniques from the standard dlog setting in abelian groups. While such an adaptation seems natural, it is per se unclear which techniques transfer from the dlog to the more general group action dlog setting, for which $X$ does not offer a group structure.\r\n\r\nOur algorithms have direct implications for all group action based cryptosystems, such as CSIDH and its variants. We provide experimental evidence that our techniques work well in the CSIDH setting.",

    "abstract": "The substitution box (S-box) is often used as the only nonlinear component in symmetric-key ciphers, leading to a significant impact on the implementation performance of ciphers in both classical and quantum application scenarios by S-box circuits. Taking the Pauli-X gate, the CNOT gate, and the Toffoli gate (i.e., the NCT gate set) as the underlying logic gates, this work investigates the quantum circuit implementation of S-boxes based on the SAT solver. Firstly, we propose encoding methods of the logic gates and the NCT-based circuit, based on which we construct STP models for implementing S-boxes. By applying the proposed models to the S-boxes of several well-known cryptographic algorithms, we construct optimal implementations with different criteria for the 4-bit S-boxes and provide the implementation bounds of different criteria for the 5-bit S-boxes. Since S-boxes in the same affine equivalence class share most of the important properties, we then build STP models to further investigate optimizing S-box circuits based on affine equivalence. According to the applications, for almost all the tested 4-bit S-boxes, there always exists an equivalent S-box that can be implemented with half the number of logic gates. Besides, we encode some important cryptographic properties and construct STP models to design S-boxes with given criteria configurations on implementation and properties. As an application, we find an S-box with the same cryptographic properties as the S-box of KECCAK that can be implemented with only 5 NCT gates, even though the application of our models indicates that implementing the KECCAK S-box requires more than 9 NCT gates. Notably, the inputs of the proposed models are tweakable, which makes the models possess some functions not currently available in the public tools for constructing optimized NCT-based circuits for S-boxes.",

    "abstract": "Third-party private set intersection (PSI) enables two parties, each holding a private set to compute their intersection and reveal the result only to an inputless third party. In this paper, we present an efficient third-party PSI protocol requiring only 3 communication rounds, while significantly lowering the computational workload compared to prior work. Our work is motivated by real-world applications such as contact tracing whereby expedition is essential while concurrently preserving privacy. Our construction attains a near-linear computational complexity of $O(n^{1+\\varepsilon})$ for large dataset size $n$, where $\\varepsilon>0$ is any fixed constant, and achieves post-quantum security. Our improvements stem from algorithmic changes and the incorporation of new techniques along with precise parameter selections to achieve a tight asymptotic bound. Furthermore, we also present a third-party PSI cardinality protocol which has not been explored in prior third-party PSI work. In a third-party PSI cardinality setting, only the third-party obtains the size of the intersection and nothing else. Our construction to achieve the cardinality functionality attains a quasilinear computational complexity for the third-party.",

    "abstract": "Private set intersection (PSI) is a cryptographic functionality for two parties to learn the intersection of their input sets, without leaking any other information. Circuit-PSI is a stronger PSI functionality where the parties learn only a secret-shared form of the desired intersection, thus without revealing the intersection directly. These secret shares can subsequently serve as input to a secure multiparty computation of any function on this intersection.\r\n\r\nIn this paper we consider several settings in which parties take part in multiple Circuit-PSI executions with the same input set, and aim to amortize communications and computations. To that end, we build up a new framework for Circuit-PSI around generalizations of oblivious (programmable) PRFs that are extended with offline setup phases. We present several efficient instantiations of this framework with new security proofs for this setting. As a side result, we obtain a slight improvement in communication and computation complexity over the state-of-the-art semi-honest Circuit-PSI protocol by Bienstock et al. (USENIX '23). Additionally, we present a novel Circuit-PSI protocol from a PRF with secret-shared outputs, which has linear communication and computation complexity in the parties' input set sizes, \r\nand is able to realize a stronger security notion. Lastly, we derive the potential amortizations over multiple protocol executions, and observe that each of the presented instantiations is favorable in at least one of the multiple-execution settings.",

    "abstract": "Despite much progress, general-purpose secure multi-party computation (MPC) with active security may still be prohibitively expensive in settings with large input datasets. This particularly applies to the secure evaluation of graph algorithms, where each party holds a subset of a large graph.  \r\n\r\nRecently, Araki et al. (ACM CCS '21) showed that dedicated solutions may provide significantly better efficiency if the input graph is sparse. In particular, they provide an efficient protocol for the secure evaluation of \"message passing\" algorithms, such as the PageRank algorithm. Their protocol's computation and communication complexity are both $\\tilde{O}(M\\cdot B)$ instead of the $O(M^2)$ complexity achieved by general-purpose MPC protocols, where $M$ denotes the number of nodes and $B$ the (average) number of incoming edges per node. On the downside, their approach achieves only a relatively weak security notion; $1$-out-of-$3$ malicious security with selective abort. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we show that PageRank can instead be captured efficiently as a restricted multiplication straight-line (RMS) program, and present a new actively secure MPC protocol tailored to handle RMS programs. In particular, we show that the local knowledge of the participants can be leveraged towards the first maliciously-secure protocol with communication complexity linear in $M$, independently of the sparsity of the graph. We present two variants of our protocol. In our communication-optimized protocol, going from semi-honest to malicious security only introduces a small communication overhead, but results in quadratic computation complexity $O(M^2)$. In our balanced protocol, we still achieve a linear communication complexity $O(M)$, although with worse constants, but a significantly better computational complexity scaling with $O(M\\cdot B)$. Additionally, our protocols achieve security with identifiable abort and can tolerate up to $n-1$ corruptions.",

    "abstract": "Fuzzy password authenticated key exchange (fuzzy PAKE) protocols enable two parties to securely exchange a session-key for further communication. The parties only need to share a low entropy password. The passwords do not even need to be identical, but can contain some errors. This may be due to typos, or because the passwords were created from noisy biometric readings. In this paper we provide an overview and comparison of existing fuzzy PAKE protocols. Furthermore, we analyze certain security properties of these protocols and argue that the protocols can be expected to be slightly more secure in practice than can be inferred from their theoretical guarantees.",

    "abstract": "Private set intersection (PSI) allows two parties to compute the intersection of their sets without revealing anything else. In some applications of PSI, a server holds a large set and runs a PSI protocol with multiple clients, each with its own smaller set. In this setting, existing protocols fall short: they either achieve only semi-honest security, or else require the server to run the protocol from scratch for each execution.\r\n\r\nWe design an efficient protocol for this setting with simulation-based security against malicious adversaries. In our protocol, the server publishes a one-time, linear-size encoding of its set. Then, multiple clients can independently execute a PSI protocol with the server, with complexity linear in the size of each client\u2019s set. To learn the intersection, a client can download the server\u2019s encoding, which can be accelerated via content-distribution or peer-to-peer networks since the same encoding is used by all clients; alternatively, clients can fetch only the relevant parts of the encoding using verifiable private information retrieval. A key ingredient of our protocol is an efficient instantiation of an oblivious verifiable unpredictable function, which may be of independent interest. \r\n\r\nOur implementation shows that our protocol is highly efficient. For a server holding $10^8$ elements and each client holding $10^3$ elements, the size of the server\u2019s encoding is 800MB; an execution of the protocol uses 60MB of communication, runs in under 5s in a WAN network with 120 Mbps bandwidth, and costs only 0.017 USD when utilizing network-caching infrastructures, a 5\u00d7 saving compared to a state-of-the-art PSI protocol.",

Unfortunately, previous solvers scale poorly for even some simple systems of field equations, in part because they build a full Gr\u00f6bner basis (GB) for the system. We propose a new solver that uses multiple, simpler GBs instead of one full GB. Our solver, implemented within the cvc5 SMT solver, admits specialized propagation algorithms, e.g., for understanding bitsums. Experiments show that it solves important bitsum-heavy determinism benchmarks far faster than prior solvers, without introducing much overhead for other benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) has opened up an attractive avenue for privacy-preserved processing of outsourced data on the untrusted cloud infrastructure. SSE aims to support efficient Boolean query processing with optimal storage and search overhead over large real databases. However, current constructions in the literature lack the support for multi-client search and dynamic updates to the encrypted databases, which are essential requirements for the widespread deployment of SSE on real cloud infrastructures. Trivially extending a state-of-the-art single client dynamic construction, such as ODXT (Patranabis et al., NDSS\u201921), incurs significant leakage that renders such extension insecure in practice. Currently, no SSE construction in the literature offers efficient multi-client query processing and search with dynamic updates over large real databases while maintaining a benign leakage profile. \r\nThis work presents the first dynamic multi-client SSE scheme Nomos supporting efficient multi-client conjunctive Boolean queries over an encrypted database. Precisely, Nomos is a multi-reader-single-writer construction that allows only the gate-keeper (or the data-owner) - a trusted entity in the Nomos framework, to update the encrypted database stored on the adversarial server. Nomos achieves forward and type-II backward privacy of dynamic SSE constructions while incurring lesser leakage than the trivial extension of ODXT to a multi- client setting. Furthermore, our construction is practically efficient and scalable - attaining linear encrypted storage and sublinear search overhead for conjunctive Boolean queries. We provide an experimental evaluation of software implementation over an extensive real dataset containing millions of records. The results show that Nomos performance is comparable to the state-of-the-art static conjunctive SSE schemes in practice.",

    "abstract": "Software solutions to address computational challenges are ubiquitous in our daily lives. One specific application area where software is often used is in embedded systems, which, like other digital electronic devices, are vulnerable to side-channel analysis attacks. Although masking is the most common countermeasure and provides a solid theoretical foundation for ensuring security, recent research has revealed a crucial gap between theoretical and real-world security. This shortcoming stems from the micro-architectural effects of the underlying micro-processor. Common security models used to formally verify masking schemes such as the d-probing model fully ignore the micro-architectural leakages that lead to a set of instructions that unintentionally recombine the shares. Manual generation of masked assembly code that remains secure in the presence of such micro-architectural recombinations often involves trial and error, and is non-trivial even for experts.\r\nMotivated by this, we present PoMMES, which enables inexperienced software developers to automatically compile masked functions written in a high-level programming language into assembly code, while preserving the theoretically proven security in practice. Compared to the state of the art, based on a general model for microarchitectural effects, our scheme allows the generation of practically secure masked software at arbitrary security orders for in-order processors. The major contribution of PoMMES is its micro-architecture aware register allocation algorithm, which is one of the crucial steps during the compilation process. In addition to simulation-based assessments that we conducted by open-source tools dedicated to evaluating masked software implementations, we confirm the effectiveness of the PoMMES-generated codes through experimental analysis. We present the result of power consumption based leakage assessments of several case studies running on a Cortex M0+ micro-controller, which is commonly deployed in industry.",

    "abstract": "In isogeny-based cryptography, bilinear pairings are regarded as a powerful tool in various applications, including key compression, public-key validation and torsion basis generation. However, in most isogeny-based protocols, the performance of pairing computations is unsatisfactory due to the high computational cost of the Miller function. Reducing the computational expense of the Miller function is crucial for enhancing the overall performance of pairing computations in isogeny-based cryptography.\r\n\r\nThis paper addresses this efficiency bottleneck. To achieve this, we propose several techniques for a better implementation of pairings in isogeny-based cryptosystems. We use (modified) Jacobian coordinates and present new algorithms for Miller function computations to compute pairings of order $2^\\bullet$ and $3^\\bullet$. For pairings of arbitrary order, which are crucial for key compression in some SIDH-based schemes (such as M-SIDH and binSIDH), we combine Miller doublings with Miller additions/subtractions, leading to a considerable speedup. Moreover, the optimizations for pairing applications in CSIDH-based protocols are also considered in this paper. In particular, our approach for supersingularity verification in CSIDH is 15.3% faster than Doliskani's test, which is the state-of-the-art.",

Also, we consider the asymptotic density of solvable systems of this form. Such systems have appeared during the analysis of some tropical cryptography protocols that were recently suggested. We show how this problem is related to the integer linear programming problem and prove that this problem is NP-complete. We show that the asymptotic density of solvable systems of this form with some restrictions on the coefficients, the number of variables, and the number of equations is 0. As a corollary, we prove that this problem (with some restrictions on the coefficients, the number of variables, and the number of equations) is decidable generically in polynomial time.",

    "abstract": "In symmetric cryptography, vectorial Boolean functions over finite fields F2n derive strong S-boxes. To this end, the S-box should satisfy a list of tests to resist existing attacks, such as the differential, linear, boomerang, and variants. Several tables are employed to measure an S- box\u2019s resistance, such as the difference distribution table (DDT) and the boomerang connectivity table (BCT). Following the boomerang attacks recently revisited in terms of the boomerang switch effect, with a lustra- tion highlighting the power of this technique, a tool called the Boomerang Difference Table (BDT), an alternative to the classical Boomerang BCT, was introduced. Next, two novel tables have been introduced, namely, the Upper Boomerang Connectivity Table (UBCT) and the Lower Boomerang Connectivity Table (LBCT), which are considered improvements over BCT while allowing systematic evaluation of boomerangs to return over mul- tiple rounds.\r\nThis paper focuses on the new tools for measuring the revisited version of boomerang attacks and the related tables UBCT, LBCT, as well as the so-called Extended Boomerang Connectivity Table (EBCT). Specifically, we shall study the properties of these novel tools and investigate the corresponding tables. We also study their interconnections, their links to the DDT, and their values for affine equivalent vectorial functions and compositional inverses of permutations of F2n . Moreover, we introduce the concept of the nontrivial boomerang connectivity uniformity and determine the explicit values of all the entries of the EBCT, LBCT, and EBCT for the important cryptographic case of the inverse function.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we address the use of Neural Networks (NN) for the\r\nassessment of the quality and hence safety of several Random Number Generators (RNGs), focusing both on the vulnerability of classical Pseudo Random Number Generators (PRNGs), such as Linear Congruential Generators (LCGs) and the RC4 algorithm, and extending our analysis to non-conventional data sources, such as Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs) based on Vertical-Cavity Surface-\r\nEmitting Laser (VCSEL). Among the results found, we identified a sort of classification of generators under different degrees of susceptibility, underlining the fundamental role of design decisions in enhancing the safety of PRNGs. The influence of network architecture design and associated hyper-parameters variations was also explored, highlighting the effectiveness of longer sequence lengths and convolutional neural\r\nnetworks in enhancing the discrimination of PRNGs against other RNGs. Moreover, in the prediction domain, the proposed model is able to deftly distinguish the raw data of our QRNG from truly random ones, exhibiting a cross-entropy error of 0.52 on the test data-set used. All these findings reveal the potential of NNs to enhance the security of RNGs, while highlighting the robustness of certain QRNGs, in particular the VCSEL-based variants, for high-quality random number generation applications.",

    "abstract": "The Ascon cipher suite has recently become the preferred standard in the NIST Lightweight Cryptography standardization process. Despite its prominence, the initial dedicated security analysis for the Ascon mode was conducted quite recently. This analysis demonstrated that the Ascon AEAD mode offers superior security compared to the generic Duplex mode, but it was limited to a specific scenario: single-user nonce-respecting, with a capacity strictly larger than the key size. In this paper, we eliminate these constraints and provide a comprehensive security analysis of the Ascon AEAD mode in the multi-user setting, where the capacity need not be larger than the key size. Regarding data complexity $D$ and time complexity $T$, our analysis reveals that Ascon achieves AEAD security when $T$ is bounded by $\\min\\{2^{\\kappa}/\\mu, 2^c\\}$ (where $\\kappa$ is the key size, and $\\mu$ is the number of users), and $DT$ is limited to $2^b$ (with $b$ denoting the size of the underlying permutation, set at 320 for Ascon). Our results align with NIST requirements, showing that Ascon allows for a tag size as small as 64 bits while supporting a higher rate of 192 bits, provided the number of users remains within recommended limits. However, this security becomes compromised as the number of users increases significantly. To address this issue, we propose a variant of the Ascon mode called LK-Ascon, which enables doubling the key size. This adjustment allows for a greater number of users without sacrificing security, while possibly offering additional resilience against quantum key recovery attacks. We establish tight bounds for LK-Ascon, and furthermore show that both Ascon and LK-Ascon maintain authenticity security even when facing nonce-misuse adversaries.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic Decentralized Functional Encryption (DDFE), introduced by Chotard et al. (CRYPTO'20), represents a robust generalization of (Multi-Client) Functional Encryption. It allows users to dynamically join and contribute private inputs to individually controlled joint functions without requiring a trusted authority.\r\n\r\nRecently, Shi et al. (PKC'23) proposed the first Multi-Client Functional Encryption scheme for function-hiding inner products (FH-IP) without relying on random oracles. Unfortunately, their construction still requires a trusted key authority, leaving open the question of whether a full-fledged FH-IP-DDFE can exist in the standard model.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we answer this question affirmatively by introducing Updatable Pseudorandom Zero Sharing, a novel concept that provides both the critical functionality and security properties needed to construct secure DDFE schemes in the standard model. \r\n\r\nOur second contribution is a novel proof strategy, which preserves adaptive security when transforming any functional encryption scheme for FH-IP into FH-IP-DDFE. Together, these two techniques enable a modular construction of FH-IP-DDFE that is secure against adaptive message and key queries in the standard model.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, our pseudorandom zero-sharing scheme is highly versatile, enabling the first DDFE for attribute-weighted sums in the standard model, complementing the recent ROM-based construction by Agrawal et al. (CRYPTO'23).",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce the first fault attack on SQIsign. By injecting a fault into the ideal generator during the commitment phase, we demonstrate a meaningful probability of inducing the generation of order $\\mathcal{O}_0$. The probability is bounded by one parameter, the degree of commitment isogeny. We also show that the probability can be reasonably estimated by assuming uniform randomness of a random variable, and provide empirical evidence supporting the validity of this approximation. In addition, we identify a loop-abort vulnerability due to the iterative structure of the isogeny operation. Exploiting these vulnerabilities, we present key recovery fault attack scenarios for two versions of SQIsign---one deterministic and the other randomized. We then analyze the time complexity and the number of queries required for each attack. Finally, we discuss straightforward countermeasures that can be implemented against the attack.",

    "abstract": "We revisit the alternating-moduli paradigm for constructing symmetric-key primitives with a focus on constructing efficient protocols to evaluate them using secure multi-party computation (MPC). The alternating-moduli paradigm of Boneh, Ishai, Passel\u00e8gue, Sahai, and Wu (TCC 2018) enables the construction of various symmetric-key primitives with the common characteristic that the inputs are multiplied by two linear maps over different moduli.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The first contribution focuses on efficient two-party evaluation of alternating-moduli pseudorandom functions (PRFs), effectively building an oblivious PRF. We present a generalized alternating-moduli PRF construction along with methods to lower the communication and computation. We then provide several variants of our protocols with different computation and communication tradeoffs for evaluating the PRF. Most of our protocols are in the hybrid model while one is based on specialized garbling. Our most efficient protocol effectively is about $3\\times$ faster and requires $1.3\\times$ less communication.\r\n    \r\n    Our next contribution is the efficient evaluation of the one-way function (OWF) $f(x)=\\mathbf{B}\\cdot_3 (\\mathbf{A} \\cdot_2 x)$ proposed by Dinur, Goldfeder, Halevi, Ishai, Kelkar, Sharma, and Zaverucha (CRYPTO 21) where $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{F}^{m\\times n}_2, \\mathbf{B}\\in\\mathbb{F}^{t\\times m}_3$, and $\\cdot_p$ is multiplication mod $p$. This surprisingly simple OWF can be evaluated within MPC by secret sharing $[\\![x]\\!]$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2$, locally computing $[\\![v]\\!]=\\mathbf{A}\\cdot_2 [\\![x]\\!]$, performing a modulus switching protocol to $\\mathbb{F}_3$ shares, followed by locally computing the output shares  $[\\![y]\\!]=\\mathbf{B}\\cdot_3 [\\![v]\\!]$. \r\n    \r\n    We design a bespoke MPC-in-the-Head (MPCitH) signature scheme that evaluates the aforementioned OWF, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The resulting signature has a size ranging from $4.0$ to $5.5$ KB, achieving between $2\\text{-}3\\times$ reduction compared to the prior work. To the best of our knowledge, this is only $\\approx 5\\%$ larger than the smallest signature based on symmetric-key primitives, including the latest NIST post-quantum cryptography competition submissions. We also show that our core techniques can be extended to build very small post-quantum ring signatures for rings of small to medium size, which are competitive with state-of-the-art lattice-based schemes. Our techniques are in fact more generally applicable to set membership in MPCitH.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a paper by Chen (eprint 2024/555) has claimed to construct a quantum polynomial-time algorithm that solves the Learning With Errors Problem (Regev, JACM 2009), for a range of parameters. As a byproduct of Chen's result, it follows that Chen's algorithm solves the Gap Shortest Vector Problem, for gap $g(n) = \\tilde{O}\\left( n^{4.5} \\right)$. In this short note we point to an error in the claims of Chen's paper.",

    "abstract": "In the implementation of isogeny-based  schemes, V\\'{e}lu's formulas are essential for constructing and evaluating odd degree isogenies. \r\nBernstein et al. proposed an approach known as $\\surd$elu, which computes an $\\ell$-isogeny at a cost of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{\\ell})$ finite field operations. This paper presents two key improvements to enhance the efficiency of\r\nthe implementation\r\nof\r\n$\\surd$\\'{e}lu from two aspects: optimizing the partition involved in $\\surd$\\'{e}lu and speeding up the computations of the sums of products used in polynomial multiplications over finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$ with large prime characteristic $p$. To optimize the partition, we adjust it to enhance the utilization of $x$-coordinates and eliminate the computational redundancy, which can ultimately reduce the number of  $\\mathbb{F}_p$-multiplications. The speedup of the sums of products is to employ two techniques: lazy reduction (abbreviated as LZYR) and generalized interleaved Montgomery multiplication (abbreviated as INTL). These techniques aim to minimize the underlying operations such as $\\mathbb{F}_p$-reductions and assembly memory instructions. We  present an optimized C and assembly code implementation of $\\surd$\\'{e}lu for the  CTIDH512 instantiation. In terms of $\\ell$-isogeny computations in CTIDH512,  the performance of clock cycles  applying new partition + INTL (resp. new partition + LZYR) offers an improvement up to $16.05\\%$ (resp. $ 10.96\\%$) compared to the previous work.",

    "abstract": "The Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is a powerful mathematical tool that has become increasingly important in developing Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE). Its ability to efficiently calculate polynomial multiplication using the convolution theorem with a quasi-linear complexity $O(n \\log{n})$ instead of $O(n^2)$ when implemented with Fast Fourier Transform-style algorithms has made it a key component in modern cryptography. FFT-style NTT algorithm or fast-NTT is particularly useful in lattice-based cryptography. In this short note, we briefly introduce the basic concepts of linear, cyclic, and negacyclic convolutions via traditional schoolbook algorithms, traditional NTT, its inverse (INTT), and FFT-like versions of NTT/INTT. We then provide consistent toy examples through different concepts and algorithms to understand the basics of NTT concepts.",

    "abstract": "Transformer neural networks have gained significant traction since their introduction, becoming pivotal across diverse domains. Particularly in large language models like Claude and ChatGPT, the transformer architecture has demonstrated remarkable efficacy. This paper provides a concise overview of transformer neural networks and delves into their security considerations, focusing on covert channel attacks and their implications for the safety of large language models. We present a covert channel utilizing encryption and demonstrate its efficacy in circumventing Claude.ai's security measures. Our experiment reveals that Claude.ai appears to log our queries and blocks our attack within two days of our initial successful breach.  This raises two concerns within the community: (1) The extensive logging of user inputs by large language models could pose privacy risks for users. (2) It may deter academic research on the security of such models due to the lack of experiment repeatability.",

    "abstract": "Secure two-party computation allows two mutually distrusting parties to compute a joint function over their inputs, guaranteeing properties such as input privacy or correctness.\r\n\r\nFor many tasks, such as joint computation of statistics, it is important that when one party receives the result of the computation, the other party also receives the result. \r\nUnfortunately, this property, which is called fairness, is unattainable in the two-party setting for arbitrary functions. So weaker variants have been proposed.\r\n\r\nOne such notion, proposed by Pass et al. (EUROCRYPT 2017) is called $\\Delta$-fairness. \r\nInformally, it guarantees that if a corrupt party receives the output in round $r$ and stops participating in the protocol, then the honest party receives the output by round $\\Delta(r)$. \r\nThis notion is achieved by using so-called secure enclaves.\r\n\r\nIn many settings, $\\Delta$-fairness is not sufficient, because a corrupt party is guaranteed to receive its output before the honest party, giving the corrupt party an advantage in further interaction.  \r\nWorse, as $\\Delta$ is known to the corrupt party, it can abort the protocol when it is most advantageous.\r\n\r\nWe extend the concept of $\\Delta$-fairness by introducing a new fairness notion, which we call hidden $\\Delta$-fairness, which addresses these problems. \r\nFirst of all, under our new notion, a corrupt party may not benefit from aborting, because it may not, with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$, learn the result first. \r\nMoreover, $\\Delta$ and other parameters are sampled according to a given distribution and remain unknown to the participants in the computation. \r\n\r\nWe propose a 2PC protocol that achieves hidden $\\Delta$-fairness, also using secure enclaves, and prove its security in the Generalized Universal Composability (GUC) framework.",

    "abstract": "We construct a digital signature scheme for images that allows the image to be compressed without invalidating the signature. More specifically, given a JPEG image signed with our signature scheme, a third party can compress the image using JPEG compression, and, as long as the quantization tables only include powers of two, derive a valid signature for the compressed image, without access to the secret signing key, and without interaction with the signer. Our scheme is constructed using a standard digital signature scheme and a hash function as building blocks. This form of signatures that allow image compression could be useful in mitigating some of the threats posed by generative AI and fake news, without interfering with all uses of generative AI.\r\n\r\nTaking inspiration from related signature schemes, we define a notion of unforgeability and prove our construction to be secure. Additionally, we show that our signatures have size 32.5 kb under standard parameter choices. Using image quality assessment metrics, we show that JPEG compression with parameters as specified by our scheme, does not result in perceivably reduced visual fidelity, compared to standard JPEG compression.",

    "abstract": "Side-Channel Attacks target the recovery of key material in cryptographic implementations by measuring physical quantities such as power consumption during the execution of a program. Simple Power Attacks consist in deducing secret information from a trace using a single or a few samples, as opposed to differential attacks which require many traces. Software cryptographic implementations now all contain a data-independent execution path, but often do not consider variations in power consumption associated to data. In this work, we show that a technique commonly used to select a value from different possible values in a control-independant way leads to significant power differences depending on the value selected. This difference is actually so important that a single sample can be considered for attacking one condition, and no training on other traces is required. We exploit this finding to propose the first single-trace attack without any knowledge gained on previous executions, using trace folding. We target the two modular exponentiation implementations in Libgcrypt, getting respectively 100% and 99.98% of correct bits in average on 30 executions using 2,048-bit exponents. We also use this technique to attack the scalar multiplication in ECDSA, successfully recovering all secret nonces on 1,000 executions. Finally, the insights we gained from this work allow us to show that a proposed counter-measure from the litterature for performing the safe loading of precomputed operands in the context of windowed implementations can be attacked as well.",

    "abstract": "The Fiat-Shamir transformation is a widely employed technique in constructing signature schemes, known as Fiat-Shamir signature schemes (FS-SIG), derived from secure identification (ID) schemes. However, the existing security proof only takes into account classical signing queries and does not consider superposition attacks, where the signing oracle is quantum-accessible to the adversaries. Alagic et al. proposed a security model called blind unforgeability (BUF, Eurocrypt'20), regarded as a preferable notion under superposition attacks.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we conduct a thorough security analysis of FS-SIGs in the BUF model. First, we propose a special property for ID schemes called quantum special honest-verifier zero-knowledge (qsHVZK), which is stronger than classical HVZK. We prove that qsHVZK is a sufficient property for BUF (with implicit rejection) of the resulting FS-SIG in the quantum random oracle model (QROM). Next, we give an efficient construction of (a weaker variant) of qsHVZK ID scheme based on the quantum hardness of LWE problems.\r\n\r\nTo avoid enhancing the requirement of HVZK, we then progress to the deterministic FS-SIG (DFS) for more efficient constructions. We show that if the pseudorandom function is quantum-access-secure (QPRF), then we can prove the BUF security of the resulting DFS only with the requirement of the standard (multi-)HVZK in the QROM. A similar result can be extended to the hedged version of FS-SIG.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we analyze the so-called Beyond UnForgeability Features (BUFF) security of the submissions to the current standardization process of additional signatures by NIST. The BUFF notions formalize security against maliciously generated keys and have various real-world use cases, where security can be guaranteed despite misuse potential on a protocol level. Consequently, NIST declared the security against the BUFF notions as desirable features. Despite NIST's interest, only $6$ out of $40$ schemes consider BUFF security at all, but none give a detailed analysis. We close this gap by analyzing the schemes based on codes, isogenies, lattices, and multivariate equations. The results vary from schemes that achieve neither notion (e.g., Wave) to schemes that achieve all notions (e.g., PROV). In particular, we dispute certain claims by SQUIRRELS and VOX regarding their BUFF security. Resulting from our analysis, we observe that three schemes (CROSS, HAWK and PROV) achieve BUFF security without having the hash of public key and message as part of the signature, as BUFF transformed schemes would have. HAWK and PROV essentially use the lighter PS-3 transform by Pornin and Stern (ACNS'05). We further point out whether this transform suffices for the other schemes to achieve the BUFF notions, with both positive and negative results.",

    "abstract": "Many proposals of lattice-based cryptosystems estimate security levels by following a recipe introduced in the New Hope proposal. This recipe, given a lattice dimension n, modulus q, and standard deviation s, outputs a \"primal block size\" \u03b2 and a security level growing linearly with \u03b2. This \u03b2 is minimal such that some \u03ba satisfies ((n+\u03ba)s^2+1)^{1/2} < (d/\u03b2)^{1/2} \u03b4^{2\u03b2\u2212d\u22121} q^{\u03ba/d}, where d = n + \u03ba + 1 and \u03b4 = (\u03b2(\u03c0\u03b2)^{1/\u03b2}/(2\u03c0 exp 1))^{1/2(\u03b2\u22121)}.\r\n\r\nThis paper identifies how \u03b2 grows with n, with enough precision to show the impact of adjusting q and s by constant factors. Specifically, this paper shows that if lg q grows as Q_0 lg n + Q_1 + o(1) and lg s grows as S_0 lg n + S_1 + o(1), where 0 <= S_0 <= 1/2 < Q_0 \u2212 S_0, then \u03b2/n grows as z_0 + (z_1+o(1))/lg n, where z_0 = 2Q_0/(Q_0\u2212S_0+1/2)^2 and z_1 has a formula given in the paper. The paper provides a traditional-format proof and a proof verified by the HOL Light proof assistant.",

    "abstract": "Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) allows for evaluating arbitrary functions over encrypted data. In Multi-party FHE applications, different parties encrypt their secret data and submit ciphertexts to a server, which, according to the application logic, performs homomorphic operations on them. For example, in a secret voting application, the tally is computed by summing up the ciphertexts encoding the votes. Valid encrypted votes are of the form $E(0)$ and $E(1)$. A malicious voter could send an invalid encrypted vote such as $E(145127835)$, which can mess up the whole election. Because of that, users must prove that the ciphertext they submitted is a valid Ring-Learning with Errors (RLWE) ciphertext and that the plaintext message they encrypted is a valid vote (for example, either a 1 or 0). Greco uses zero-knowledge proof to let a user prove that their RLWE ciphertext is well-formed. Or, in other words, that the encryption operation was performed correctly. The resulting proof can be, therefore, composed with additional application-specific logic and subject to public verification in a non-interactive setting. Considering the secret voting application, one can prove further properties of the message being encrypted or even properties about the voter, allowing the application to support anonymous voting as well. The prover has been implemented using Halo2-lib as a proving system, and the benchmarks have shown that Greco can already be integrated into user-facing applications without creating excessive friction for the user. The implementation is available at https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/greco",

    "abstract": "A common strategy for constructing multivariate encryption schemes is to use a central map that is easy to invert over an extension field, along with a small number of modifications to thwart potential attacks. In this work we study the effectiveness of these modifications, by deriving estimates for the number of degree fall polynomials. After developing the necessary tools, we focus on encryption schemes using the $C^*$ and Dobbertin central maps, with the internal perturbation (ip), and $Q_+$ modifications. For these constructions we are able to accurately predict the number of degree fall polynomials produced in a Gr\u00f6bner basis attack, up to and including degree five for the Dob encryption scheme and four for $C^*$. The predictions remain accurate even when fixing variables. Based on this new theory we design a novel attack on Dob, which completely recovers the secret key for the parameters suggested by its designers.  Due to the generality of the presented techniques, we also believe that they are of interest to the analysis of other big field schemes.",

    "abstract": "Cumplido, Mar\u00eda et al. have recently shown that the Wang-Hu digital signature is not secure and has presented a potential attack on the root extraction problem. The effectiveness of generic attacks on solving this problem for braids is still uncertain and it is unknown if it is possible to create braids that require exponential time to solve these problems. In 2023, Lin and al. has proposed a post-quantum signature scheme similar to the Wang-Hu scheme that is proven to be able to withstand attacks from quantum computers. However, evidence is presented here for the existence of an algorithm based on mean-set attacks that can recover the private key in both schemes without solving the root extraction problem. In the post-quantum signature version, we prove that the attacker can forge a signature passing the verification without recovering the private key",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel blockchain-based decentralized identity system (DID), tailored for enhanced digital identity management in Internet of Things (IoT) and device-to-device (D2D) networks. The proposed system features a hierarchical structure that effectively merges a distributed ledger with a mobile D2D network, ensuring robust security while streamlining communication. Central to this design are the gateway nodes, which serve as intermediaries, facilitating DID registration and device authentication through smart contracts and distributed storage systems. A thorough security analysis underscores the system\u2019s resilience to common cyber threats and adherence to critical principles like finality and liveness.",

    "abstract": "Security proofs for cryptographic primitives typically assume operations are executed in the correct sequence; however, insecure implementations or software-level attacks can disrupt control flows, potentially invalidating these guarantees. To address this issue, we introduce a new security notion, IND-CFA, which formalizes decryption\r\nsecurity in the presence of adversarially controlled execution flows. Using this notion, we investigate the control flows under which a cryptographic scheme remains secure, providing insights into secure implementation practices. We revisit the Encrypt-then-MAC paradigm, underscoring the crucial role of operation sequencing in ensuring the\r\nsecurity of authenticated encryption schemes built using this method. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of the Encode-then-Encipher (EtE) paradigm, a widely adopted approach for constructing robust AE schemes, revealing its vulnerability to adversarial control flows that can enable attackers to infer low-entropy values in the\r\npresence of multiple failure conditions.",

    "abstract": "A probabilistically checkable argument (PCA) is a computational relaxation of PCPs, where soundness is guaranteed to hold only for false proofs generated by a computationally bounded adversary. The advantage of PCAs is that they are able to overcome the limitations of PCPs. A succinct PCA has a proof length that is polynomial in the witness length (and is independent of the non-deterministic verification time), which is impossible for PCPs, under standard complexity assumptions. Bronfman and Rothblum (ITCS 2022) constructed succinct PCAs for NC that are publicly-verifiable and have constant query complexity under the sub-exponential hardness of LWE.\r\n\r\nWe construct a publicly-verifiable succinct PCA with constant query complexity for all NP in the adaptive security setting. Our PCA scheme offers several improvements compared to the Bronfman and Rothblum construction: (1) it applies to all problems in NP, (2) it achieves adaptive security, and (3) it can be realized under any of the following assumptions: the polynomial hardness of LWE; $O(1)$-LIN on bilinear maps; or sub-exponential DDH. \r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, our PCA scheme has a succinct prover, which means that  for any NP relation that can be verified in time $T$ and space $S$, the proof can be generated in time $O_{\\lambda,m}(T\\cdot\\mathrm{polylog}(T))$ and space $O_{\\lambda,m}(S\\cdot\\mathrm{polylog}(T))$. Here, ${O}_{\\lambda,m}$ accounts for polynomial factors in the security parameter and in the size of the witness. En route, we construct a new complexity-preserving RAM delegation scheme that is used in our PCA construction and may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "In a secret-sharing scheme, a secret is shared among $n$ parties such that the secret can be recovered by authorized coalitions, while it should be kept hidden from unauthorized coalitions. In this work we study secret-sharing for $k$-slice access structures, in which coalitions of size $k$ are either authorized or not, larger coalitions are authorized and smaller are unauthorized. Known schemes for these access structures had smaller shares for small $k$'s than for large ones; hence our focus is on \"high\" $(n-k)$-slices where $k$ is small. \r\n\r\nOur work is inspired by several motivations: 1) Obtaining efficient schemes (with perfect or computational security) for natural families of access structures; 2) Making progress in the search for better schemes for general access structures, which are often based on schemes for slice access structures; 3) Proving or disproving the conjecture by Csirmaz (J. Math. Cryptol., 2020) that an access structures and its dual can be realized by secret-sharing schemes with the same share size.\r\n\r\nThe main results of this work are:\r\n- Perfect schemes for high slices. We present a scheme for $(n-k)$-slices with information-theoretic security and share size $kn\\cdot 2^{\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{k \\log n})}$. Using a different scheme with slightly larger shares, we prove that the ratio between the optimal share size of $k$-slices and that of their dual $(n-k)$-slices is bounded by $n$.\r\n- Computational schemes for high slices. We present a scheme for $(n-k)$-slices with computational security and share size $O(k^2 \\lambda \\log n)$ based on the existence of one-way functions. Our scheme makes use of a non-standard view point on Shamir secret-sharing that allows to share many secrets with different thresholds with low cost.    \r\n- Multislice access structures. $(a:b)$-multislices are access structures that behave similarly to slices, but are unconstrained on coalitions in a wider range of cardinalities between $a$ and $b$. We use our new schemes for high slices to realize multislices with the same share sizes that their duals have today. This solves an open question raised by Applebaum and Nir (Crypto, 2021), and allows to realize hypergraph access structures that are chosen uniformly at random under a natural set of distributions with share size $2^{0.491n+o(n)}$ compared to the previous result of $2^{0.5n+o(n)}$.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we study the worst-case to average-case hardness of the Learning with Errors problem (LWE) under an alternative measure of hardness $\u2212$ the maximum success probability achievable by a probabilistic polynomial-time (PPT) algorithm. Previous works by Regev (STOC 2005), Peikert (STOC 2009), and Brakerski, Peikert, Langlois, Regev, Stehle (STOC 2013) give worst-case to average-case reductions from lattice problems to LWE, specifically from the approximate decision variant of the Shortest Vector Problem (GapSVP) and the Bounded Distance Decoding (BDD) problem. These reductions, however, are lossy in the sense that even the strongest assumption on the worst-case hardness of GapSVP or BDD implies only mild hardness of LWE. Our alternative perspective gives a much tighter reduction and strongly relates the hardness of LWE to that of BDD. In particular, we show that under a reasonable assumption about the success probability of solving BDD via a PPT algorithm, we obtain a nearly tight lower bound on the highest possible success probability for solving LWE via a PPT algorithm. Furthermore, we show a tight relationship between the best achievable success probability by any probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm for decision-LWE to that of search-LWE. Our results not only refine our understanding of the computational complexity of LWE, but also provide a useful framework for analyzing the practical security implications.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes general meet-in-the-middle (MitM) attack frameworks for  preimage and collision attacks on hash functions based on (generalized) sponge construction. \r\nAs the first contribution, our MitM preimage attack framework covers a wide range of sponge-based hash functions, especially those with  lower claimed security level for preimage compared to their output size. Those hash functions have been very widely standardized  (e.g., Ascon-Hash, PHOTON, etc.), but are rarely studied against preimage attacks. Even the recent MitM attack framework on sponge construction by  Qin et al. (EUROCRYPT 2023) cannot attack those hash functions. As the second contribution, our MitM collision attack framework  shows a different tool for the collision cryptanalysis on sponge  construction, while previous collision attacks on sponge  construction are mainly based on differential attacks. \r\nMost of the results in this paper are the first third-party cryptanalysis results. If cryptanalysis previously existed, our new results significantly improve the previous results, such as improving the previous 2-round collision attack on Ascon-Hash to the current 4 rounds, improving the previous 3.5-round quantum preimage attack on SPHINCS$^+$-Haraka to our 4-round classical preimage attack, etc.",

    "abstract": "We have investigated both the padding scheme and the applicability of algebraic attacks to both XHash8 and XHash12. The only vulnerability of the padding scheme we can find is plausibly applicable only in the multi-rate setting---for which the authors make no claim---and is safe otherwise.\r\n\r\nFor algebraic attack relying on the computation and exploitation of a Gr\u00f6bner basis, our survey of the literature suggests to base a security argument on the complexity of the variable elimination step rather than that of the computation of the Gr\u00f6bner basis itself. Indeed, it turns out that the latter complexity is hard to estimate---and is sometimes litteraly non-existent. Focusing on the elimination step, we propose a generalization of the \"FreeLunch\" approach which, under a reasonable conjecture about the behaviour of the degree of polynomial ideals of dimension 0, is sufficient for us to argue that both XHash8 and XHash12 are safe against such attacks.\r\n\r\nWe implemented a simplified version of the generation (and resolution) of the corresponding set of equations in SAGE, which allowed us to validate our conjecture at least experimentally, and in fact to show that the lower bound it provides on the ideal degree is not tight---meaning we are a priori understimating the security of these permutations against the algebraic attacks we consider.\r\n\r\nAt this stage, if used as specified, these hash functions seem safe from Gr\u00f6bner bases-based algebraic attacks.",

    "abstract": "We define the notion of a classical commitment scheme to quantum states, which allows a quantum prover to compute a classical commitment to a quantum state, and later open each qubit of the state in either the standard or the Hadamard basis.  Our notion is a strengthening of the measurement protocol from  Mahadev (STOC 2018).  We construct such a commitment scheme from the post-quantum Learning With Errors (LWE) assumption, and more generally from any noisy trapdoor claw-free function family that has the distributional strong adaptive hardcore bit property (a property that we define in this work). \r\n    \r\n    Our scheme is succinct in the sense that the running time of the verifier in the commitment phase depends only on the security parameter (independent of the size of the committed state), and its running time in the opening phase grows only with the number of qubits that are being opened (and the security parameter).  As a corollary we obtain a classical succinct argument system for QMA under the post-quantum LWE assumption.  Previously, this was only known assuming post-quantum secure indistinguishability obfuscation.  As an additional corollary we obtain a generic way of converting any X/Z quantum PCP into a succinct argument system under the quantum hardness of LWE.",

Moreover, a finite-length achievability region is established for the model using an output statistics of random binning method, giving an achievable bound for low-latency applications.",

    "abstract": "The coexistence of RSA and elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC) had continued over forty years. It is well-known that ECC has the advantage of shorter key than RSA, which often leads a newcomer to assume that ECC runs faster. In this report, we generate the Mathematica codes for RSA-2048 and ECC-256, which visually show that RSA-2048 runs three times faster than ECC-256. It is also estimated that RSA-2048 runs 48,000 times faster than Weil pairing with 2 embedding degree and a fixed point.",

    "abstract": "Hash-and-Sign with Retry is a popular technique to design efficient signature schemes from code-based or multivariate assumptions. Contrary to Hash-and-Sign signatures based on preimage-sampleable functions as defined by Gentry, Peikert and Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2008), trapdoor functions in code-based and multivariate schemes are not surjective. Therefore, the standard approach uses random trials. Kosuge and Xagawa (PKC 2024) coined it the Hash-and-Sign with Retry paradigm.\r\n\r\nAs many attacks have appeared on code-based and multivariate schemes, we think it is important for the ongoing NIST competition to look at the security proofs of these schemes. The original proof of Sakumoto, Shirai, and Hiwatari (PQCrypto 2011) was flawed, then corrected by Chatterjee, Das and Pandit (INDOCRYPT 2022). The fix is still not sufficient, as it only works for very large finite fields. A new proof in the Quantum ROM model was proposed by Kosuge and Xagawa (PKC 2024), but it is rather loose, even when restricted to the classical setting.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce several tools that yield tighter security bounds for Hash-and-Sign with Retry signatures in the classical setting. These include the Hellinger distance, stochastic dominance arguments, and a new combinatorial tool to transform a proof in the non-adaptative setting to the adaptative setting. Ultimately, we obtain a sharp bound for the security of Hash-and-Sign with Retry signatures, applicable to various code-based and multivariate schemes. Focusing on NIST candidates, we apply these results to the MAYO, PROV, and modified UOV signature schemes. In most cases, our bounds are tight enough to apply with the real parameters of those schemes; in some cases, smaller parameters would suffice.",

    "abstract": "Delegatable Anonymous Credentials (DAC) are an enhanced Anonymous Credentials (AC) system that allows credential owners to use credentials anonymously, as well as anonymously delegate them to other users. In this work, we introduce a new concept called Delegatable Attribute-based Anonymous Credentials with Chainable Revocation (DAAC-CR), which extends the functionality of DAC by allowing 1) fine-grained attribute delegation, 2) issuers to restrict the delegation capabilities of the delegated users at a fine-grained level, including the depth of delegation and the sets of delegable attributes, and 3) chainable revocation, meaning if a credential within the delegation chain is revoked, all subsequent credentials derived from it are also invalid. \r\n\r\nWe provide a practical DAAC-CR instance based on a novel primitive that we identify as structure-preserving signatures on equivalence classes on vector commitments (SPSEQ-VC). This primitive may be of independent interest, and we detail an efficient construction. Compared to traditional DAC systems that rely on non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proofs, the credential size in our DAAC-CR instance is constant, independent of the length of delegation chain and the number of attributes.  We formally prove the security of our scheme in the generic group model and demonstrate its practicality through performance benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a powerful Privacy-Enhancing Technology (PET) that enables computations on encrypted data without having access to the secret key. While FHE holds immense potential for enhancing data privacy and security, creating its practical applications is associated with many difficulties. A significant barrier is the absence of easy-to-use, standardized components that developers can utilize as foundational building blocks. Addressing this gap requires constructing a comprehensive library of FHE components, a complex endeavor due to multiple inherent problems. We propose a competition-based approach for building such a library. More concretely, we present FHERMA, a new challenge platform that introduces black-box and white-box challenges, and fully automated evaluation of submitted FHE solutions. The initial challenges on the FHERMA platform are motivated by practical problems in machine learning and blockchain. The winning solutions get integrated into an open-source library of FHE components, which is available to all members of the PETs community under the Apache 2.0 license.",

    "abstract": "Hadamard product is a point-wise product for two vectors. This paper presents a new scheme to prove Hadamard-product relation as a sub-protocol for SNARKs based on univariate polynomials. Prover uses linear cryptographic operations to generate the proof containing logarithmic field elements. The verification takes logarithmic cryptographic operations with constant numbers of pairings in bilinear group. The construction of the scheme is based on the Lagrange-based KZG commitments (Kate, Zaverucha, and Goldberg\r\nat Asiacrypt 2010) and the folding technique. We construct an inner-product protocol from folding technique on univariate polynomials in Lagrange form, and by carefully choosing the random polynomials suitable for folding technique, we construct a Hadamard-product protocol from the inner-product protocol, giving an alternative to prove linear algebra relations in linear time, and the protocol has a better concrete proof size than previous works.",

    "abstract": "Blind signatures enable a receiver to obtain signatures on messages of its choice without revealing any message to the signer. Round-optimal blind signatures are designed as a two-round interactive protocol between a signer and receiver. Coincidentally, the choice of message is not important in many applications, and is routinely set as a random (unstructured) message by a receiver.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of designing more efficient blind signatures for such applications, Hanzlik (Eurocrypt '23) introduced a new variant called non-interactive blind signatures (NIBS). These allow a signer to asynchronously generate partial signatures for any recipient such that only the intended recipient can extract a blinded signature for a random message. This bypasses the two-round barrier for traditional blind signatures, yet enables many known applications. Hanzlik provided new practical designs for NIBS from bilinear pairings.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose new enhanced security properties for NIBS as well as provide multiple constructions with varying levels of security and concrete efficiency. We propose a new generic paradigm for NIBS from circuit-private leveled homomorphic encryption achieving optimal-sized signatures (i.e., same as any non-blind signature) at the cost of large public keys. We also investigate concretely efficient NIBS with post-quantum security, satisfying weaker level of privacy as proposed by Hanzlik.",

    "abstract": "The revelations of Edward Snowden in 2013 rekindled concerns within the cryptographic community regarding the potential subversion of cryptographic systems. Bellare et al. (CRYPTO'14) introduced the notion of Algorithm Substitution Attacks (ASAs), which aim to covertly leak sensitive information by undermining individual cryptographic primitives. In this work, we delve deeply into the realm of ASAs against protocols built upon cryptographic primitives. In particular, we revisit the existing ASA model proposed by Berndt et al. (AsiaCCS'22), providing a more fine-grained perspective. We introduce a novel ASA model tailored for protocols, capable of capturing a wide spectrum of subversion attacks. Our model features a modular representation of subverted parties within protocols, along with fine-grained definitions of undetectability. To illustrate the practicality of our model, we applied it to Lindell's two-party ECDSA protocol (CRYPTO'17), unveiling a range of ASAs targeting the protocol's parties with the objective of extracting secret key shares. Our work offers a comprehensive ASA model suited to cryptographic protocols, providing a useful framework for understanding ASAs against protocols.",

    "abstract": "An inner product argument (IPA) is a cryptographic primitive used to construct a zero-knowledge proof system, which is a notable privacy-enhancing technology. We propose a novel efficient IPA called $\\mathsf{Cougar}$. $\\mathsf{Cougar}$ features cubic root verifier and logarithmic communication under the discrete logarithm (DL) assumption. At Asiacrypt2022, Kim et al. proposed two square root verifier IPAs under the DL assumption. Our main objective is to overcome the limitation of square root complexity in the DL setting. To achieve this, we combine two distinct square root IPAs from Kim et al.: one with pairing ($\\mathsf{Protocol3}$; one was later named $\\mathsf{Leopard}$) and one without pairing ($\\mathsf{Protocol4}$). To construct $\\mathsf{Cougar}$, we first revisit $\\mathsf{Protocol4}$ and reconstruct it to make it compatible with the proof system for the homomorphic commitment scheme. Next, we utilize $\\mathsf{Protocol3}$ as the proof system for the reconstructed $\\mathsf{Protocol4}$. Finally, to facilitate proving the relation between elliptic curve points appearing in $\\mathsf{Protocol4}$, we introduce a novel $\\mathsf{Plonkish}$-based proof system equipped with custom gates for mixed elliptic curve addition. We show that $\\mathsf{Cougar}$ indeed satisfies all the claimed features, along with providing a soundness proof under the DL assumption. In addition, we implemented $\\mathsf{Cougar}$ in Rust, demonstrating that the verification time of $\\mathsf{Cougar}$ increases much slowly as the length of the witness $N$ grows, compared to other IPAs under the DL assumption and transparatent setup: BulletProofs and $\\mathsf{Leopard}$. Concretely, $\\mathsf{Cougar}$ takes 0.346s for verification in our setting when $N = 2^{20}$, which is a $50\\times$ speed-up from BulletProofs.",

Mercurial vector commitments (MVC) and mercurial functional commitments (MFC), as variants of VC, are central techniques for constructing more advanced cryptographic primitives, such as zero-knowledge sets and zero-knowledge functional elementary databases (ZK-FEDB). However, existing MFCs $\\textit{only support linear functions}$, which limits their applicability\u2014for instance, in building ZK-FEDBs that support only linear function queries. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, the current MFCs and ZK-FEDBs, including the state-of-the-art proposed by Zhang and Deng (ASIACRYPT '23) using RSA accumulators, are all based on group-based assumptions and $\\textit{cannot resist quantum computer attacks}$.\r\n\r\nTo address these limitations, we $\\textit{first}$ formalize the system and security models of MFC to support Boolean circuits. Then, we target specific properties of a new falsifiable assumption, namely the $\\mathsf{BASIS}$ assumption proposed by Wee and Wu (EUROCRYPT '23), to construct the $\\textit{first}$ lattice-based succinct mercurial functional commitment for Boolean circuits. As an application of our construction, we demonstrate how it can be used to build the $\\textit{first}$ lattice-based ZK-FEDB within the existing generic framework.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel KZG-based sum-check scheme, dubbed $\\mathsf{Losum}$, with optimal efficiency. Particularly, its proving cost is one multi-scalar-multiplication of size $k$---the number of non-zero entries in the vector, its verification cost is one pairing plus one group scalar multiplication, and the proof consists of only one group element.\r\n\r\nUsing $\\mathsf{Losum}$ as a component, we then construct a new lookup argument, named $\\mathsf{Locq}$, which enjoys a smaller proof size and a lower verification cost compared to the state of the arts $\\mathsf{cq}$, $\\mathsf{cq}$+ and $\\mathsf{cq}$++. Specifically, the proving cost of $\\mathsf{Locq}$ is comparable to $\\mathsf{cq}$, keeping the advantage that the proving cost is independent of the table size after preprocessing. For verification, $\\mathsf{Locq}$ costs four pairings, while $\\mathsf{cq}$, $\\mathsf{cq}$+ and $\\mathsf{cq}$++ require five, five and six pairings, respectively. For proof size, a $\\mathsf{Locq}$ proof consists of four $\\mathbb{G}_1$ elements and one $\\mathbb{G}_2$ element; when instantiated with the BLS12-381 curve, the proof size of $\\mathsf{Locq}$ is $2304$ bits, while $\\mathsf{cq}$, $\\mathsf{cq}$+ and $\\mathsf{cq}$++ have $3840$, $3328$ and $2944$ bits, respectively. Moreover, $\\mathsf{Locq}$ is zero-knowledge as $\\mathsf{cq}$+ and $\\mathsf{cq}$++, whereas $\\mathsf{cq}$ is not. $\\mathsf{Locq}$ is more efficient even compared to the non-zero-knowledge (and more efficient) versions of $\\mathsf{cq}$+ and $\\mathsf{cq}$++.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning as a service requires the client to trust the server and provide its own private information to use this service. Usually, clients may worry that their private data is being collected by server without effective supervision, and the server also aims to ensure proper management of the user data to foster the advancement of its services. In this work, we focus on private decision tree evaluation (PDTE) which can alleviates such privacy concerns associated with classification tasks using decision tree. After the evaluation, except for some hyperparameters, the client only receives the classification results from the server, while the server learns nothing.\r\n\r\nFirstly, we propose three amortized efficient private comparison algorithms: TECMP, RDCMP, and CDCMP, which are based on the leveled homomorphic encryption. They are non-interactive, high precision (up to 26624-bit), many-to-many, and output expressive, achieving an amortized cost of less than 1 ms under 32-bit, which is an order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art. Secondly, we propose three batch PDTE schemes using this private comparison: TECMP-PDTE, RDCMP-PDTE, and CDCMP-PDTE. Due to the batch operations, we utilized a clear rows relation (CRR) algorithm, which obfuscates the position and classification results of the different row data. Finally, in decision tree exceeding 1000 nodes under 16-bit each, the amortized runtime of TECMP-PDTE and RDCMP-PDTE both more than 56$\\times$ faster than state-of-the-art, while the TECMP-PDTE with CRR still achieves 14$\\times$ speedup. Even in a single row and a tree of fewer than 100 nodes with 64-bit, the TECMP-PDTE maintains a comparable performance with the current work.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, quantum technology has been rapidly developed. As security analyses for symmetric ciphers continue to emerge, many require an evaluation of the resources needed for the quantum circuit implementation of the encryption algorithm. In this regard, we propose the quantum circuit decision problem, which requires us to determine whether there exists a quantum circuit for a given permutation f using M ancilla qubits and no more than K quantum gates within the circuit depth D. Firstly, we investigate heuristic algorithms and classical SAT-based models in previous works, revealing their limitations in solving the problem. Hence, we innovatively propose an improved SAT-based model incorporating three metrics of quantum circuits. The model enables us to find the optimal quantum circuit of an arbitrary 3 or 4-bit S-box under a given optimization goal based on SAT solvers, which has proved the optimality of circuits constructed by the tool, LIGHTER-R. Then, by combining different criteria in the model, we find more compact quantum circuit implementations of S-boxes such as RECTANGLE and GIFT. For GIFT S-box, our model provides the optimal quantum circuit that only requires 8 gates with a depth of 31. Furthermore, our model can be generalized to linear layers and improve the previous SAT-based model proposed by Huang et al. in ASIACRYPT 2022 by adding the criteria on the number of qubits and the circuit depth.",

    "abstract": "We study the hardness of the Syndrome Decoding problem, the base of most code-based cryptographic schemes, such as Classic McEliece, in the presence of side-channel information. We use ChipWhisperer equipment to perform a template attack on Classic McEliece running on an ARM Cortex-M4, and accurately classify the Hamming weights of consecutive 32-bit blocks of the secret error vector. With these weights at hand, we optimize Information Set Decoding algorithms. Technically, we show how to speed up information set decoding via a dimension reduction, additional parity-check equations, and an improved information set search, all derived from the Hamming weight information.\r\n\r\nConsequently, using our template attack, we can practically recover an error vector in dimension n=2197 in a matter of seconds. Without side-channel information, such an instance has a complexity of around 88 bit.\r\nWe also estimate how our template attack affects the security of the proposed McEliece parameter sets. Roughly speaking, even an error-prone leak of our Hamming weight information leads for n=3488 to a security drop of 89 bits.",

    "abstract": "It has been shown that the selfish mining attack enables a miner to achieve an unfair relative revenue, posing a threat to the progress of longest-chain blockchains. Although selfish mining is a well-studied attack in the context of Proof-of-Work blockchains, its impact on the longest-chain Proof-of-Stake (LC-PoS) protocols needs yet to be addressed. This paper involves both theoretical and implementation-based approaches to analyze the selfish proposing attack in the LC-PoS protocols. We discuss how factors such as the nothing-at-stake phenomenon and the proposer predictability in PoS protocols can make the selfish proposing attack in LC-PoS protocols more destructive compared to selfish mining in PoW. In the first part of the paper, we use combinatorial tools to theoretically assess the selfish proposer\u2019s block ratio in simplistic LC-PoS environments and under simplified network connection. However, these theoretical tools or classical MDP-based approaches cannot be applied to analyze the selfish proposing attack in real-world and more complicated LC-PoS environments. To overcome this issue, in the second part of the paper, we employ deep reinforcement learning techniques to find the near-optimal strategy of selfish proposing in more sophisticated protocols. The tool implemented in the paper can help us analyze the selfish proposing attack across diverse blockchain protocols with different reward mechanisms, predictability levels, and network conditions.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new framework, POKE, to build cryptographic protocols from irrational isogenies using higher-dimensional representations. The framework enables two parties to manipulate higher-dimensional representations of isogenies to efficiently compute their pushforwards, and ultimately to obtain a shared secret.\r\n\r\nWe provide three constructions based on POKE: the first is a PKE protocol, which is one of the most compact post-quantum PKEs and possibly the most efficient isogeny-based PKE to date. We then introduce a validation technique to ensure the correctness of uniSIDH public keys: by combining the validation method with a POKE-based construction, we obtain a split KEM, a primitive that generalizes NIKEs and can be used to instantiate a post-quantum version of the Signal's X3DH protocol. The third construction builds upon the split KEM and its validation method to obtain a round-optimal verifiable OPRF. It is the first such construction that does not require more than $\\lambda$ isogeny computations, and it is significantly more compact and more efficient than all other isogeny-based OPRFs.",

    "abstract": "Mercurial signatures are an extension of equivalence class signatures that allow malleability for the public keys, messages, and signatures within the respective classes. Unfortunately, the most efficient construction to date suffers from a weak public key class-hiding property, where the original signer with the signing key can link the public keys in the same class. This is a severe limitation in their applications, where the signer is often considered untrustworthy of privacy.\r\n\r\nThis paper presents two-party and multi-party interactive threshold mercurial signatures that overcome the above limitation by eliminating the single entity who knows the signing key. For the general case, we propose two constructions. The first follows the same interactive structure as the two-party case, avoiding complex distributed computations such as randomness generation, inversion, and multiplication, and even eliminates the need for private communication between parties. The second is based on a blueprint for general multi-party computation using verifiable secret sharing, but adopting optimizations.\r\n\r\nWe show applications in anonymous credential systems that individually fit the two-party and multi-party constructions. In particular, in the two-party case, our approach provides stronger privacy by completely removing the trust in the authorities. We also discuss more applications, from blind signatures to multi-signatures and threshold ring signatures.\r\n\r\nFinally, to showcase the practicality of our approach, we implement our interactive constructions and compare them against related alternatives.",

    "abstract": "The traveling salesman problem is the problem of finding out the shortest route in a network of cities, that a salesman needs to travel to cover all the cities, without visiting the same city more than once. This problem is known to be $NP$-hard with a brute-force complexity of $O(N^N)$ or $O(N^{2N})$ for $N$ number of cities. This problem is equivalent to finding out the shortest Hamiltonian cycle in a given graph, if at least one Hamiltonian cycle exists in it. Quantum algorithms for this problem typically provide with a quadratic speedup only, using Grover's search, thereby having a complexity of $O(N^{N/2})$ or $O(N^N)$. We present a bounded-error quantum polynomial-time (BQP) algorithm for solving the problem, providing with an exponential speedup. The overall complexity of our algorithm is $O(N^3\\log(N)\\kappa/\\epsilon + 1/\\epsilon^3)$, where the errors $\\epsilon$ are $O(1/{\\rm poly}(N))$, and $\\kappa$ is the not-too-large condition number of the matrix encoding all Hamiltonian cycles.",

    "abstract": "Existing oblivious systems offer robust security by concealing memory access patterns, but they encounter significant scalability and performance challenges. Recent efforts to enhance the practicality of these systems involve embedding oblivious computation, e.g., oblivious sorting and shuffling, within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). For instance, oblivious sort has been heavily utilized: in Oblix (S&P'18), when oblivious indexes are created and accessed; in Snoopy's high-throughput oblivious key-value (SOSP'21) during initialization and when the input requests are deduplicated and prepared for delivery; in Opaque (NSDI'17) for all the proposed oblivious SQL operators; in the state-of-the-art non-foreign key oblivious join approach (PVLDB'20). Additionally, oblivious sort/shuffle find applications in Signal's commercial solution for contact discovery, anonymous Google's Key Transparency, Searchable Encryption, software monitoring, and differentially private federated learning with user privacy. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we address the scalability bottleneck of oblivious sort and shuffle by re-designing these approaches to achieve high efficiency in distributed multi-enclave environments. First, we propose a multi-threaded bitonic sort optimized for the distributed setting, making it the most performant oblivious sort for small number of enclaves (up to 4). For larger numbers of enclaves, we propose a novel oblivious bucket sort, which improves data locality and network consumption and outperforms our optimized distributed bitonic-sort by up to 5-6x. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first distributed oblivious TEE-based sorting solutions. For reference, we are able to sort 2 GiB of data in 1 second and 128 GiB in 53.4 seconds in a multi-enclave test. A fundamental building block of our oblivious bucket-sort is an oblivious shuffle that improves the prior state-of-the-art result (CCS'22) by up to 9.5x in the distributed multi-enclave setting---interestingly it is better by 10% even in the single-enclave/multi-thread setting.",

    "abstract": "A Verifiable Random Function (VRF) can be evaluated on an input by a prover who holds a secret key, generating a pseudorandom output and a proof of output validity that can be verified using the corresponding public key. VRFs are a central building block of committee election mechanisms that sample parties to execute tasks in cryptographic protocols, e.g. generating blocks in a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain or executing a round of MPC protocols. We propose the notion, and a matching construction, of an Aggregatable Key-Evolving VRF (A-KE-VRF) with the following extra properties: 1. Aggregation: combining proofs for several VRF evaluations of different inputs under different secret keys into a single constant size proof; 2. Key-Evolving: preventing adversaries who corrupt a party (learning their secret key) from ``forging'' proofs of past VRF evaluations. As an immediate application, we improve on the block size of PoS blockchains and on the efficiency of Proofs of Proof-of-Stake (PoPoS). Furthermore, the A-KE-VRF notion allows us to construct Encryption to the Future (EtF) and Authentication from the Past (AfP) schemes with a Key-Evolving property, which provides forward security.  An EtF scheme allows for sending a message to a party who is randomly selected to execute a role in the future, while an AfP scheme allows for this party to authenticate their messages as coming from a past execution of this role. These primitives are essential for realizing the YOSO MPC Framework (CRYPTO'21).",

    "abstract": "In 1994, Shor introduced his famous quantum algorithm to factor integers and compute discrete logarithms in polynomial time. In 2023, Regev proposed a multi-dimensional version of Shor's algorithm that requires far fewer quantum gates. His algorithm relies on a number-theoretic conjecture on the elements in $(\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ that can be written as short products of very small prime numbers. We prove a version of this conjecture using tools from analytic number theory such as zero-density estimates. As a result, we obtain an unconditional proof of correctness of this improved quantum algorithm and of subsequent variants.",

    "abstract": "The conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS) primitive is among the simplest cryptographic settings in which to study the relationship between communication, randomness, and security. CDS involves two parties, Alice and Bob, who do not communicate but who wish to reveal a secret $z$ to a referee if and only if a Boolean function $f$ has $f(x,y)=1$. Alice knows $x,z$, Bob knows $y$, and the referee knows $x,y$. Recently, a quantum analogue of this primitive called CDQS was defined and related to f-routing, a task studied in the context of quantum position-verification. CDQS has the same inputs, outputs, and communication pattern as CDS but allows the use of shared entanglement and quantum messages. We initiate the systematic study of CDQS, with the aim of better understanding the relationship between privacy and quantum resources in the information theoretic setting. We begin by looking for quantum analogues of results already established in the classical CDS literature. Doing so we establish a number of basic properties of CDQS, including lower bounds on entanglement and communication stated in terms of measures of communication complexity. Because of the close relationship to the $f$-routing position-verification scheme, our results have relevance to the security of these schemes.",

    "abstract": "The expansion of flip-chip technologies and a lack of backside protection make the integrated circuit (IC) vulnerable to certain classes of physical attacks mounted from the IC's backside. Laser-assisted probing, electromagnetic, and body-biasing injection attacks are examples of such attacks. Unfortunately, there are few countermeasures proposed in the literature, and none are available commercially. Those that do exist are not only expensive but also incompatible with current IC manufacturing processes. They also cannot be integrated into legacy systems, such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), which are integral parts of many industrial and defense systems. In this paper, we demonstrate how the impedance monitoring of the printed circuit board (PCB) and IC package's power distribution network (PDN) using on-chip circuit-based network analyzers can detect IC backside tampering. Our method is based on the fact that any attempt to expose the backside silicon substrate, such as the removal of the fan and heatsinks, leads to changes in the equivalent impedance of the package's PDN, and hence, scanning the package impedance will reveal if the package integrity has been violated. To validate our claims, we deploy an on-FPGA network analyzer on an AMD Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC manufactured with 16 nm technology, which is part of a multi-PCB system. We conduct a series of experiments at different temperatures, leveraging the difference of means as the statistical metric, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting tamper events required to expose the IC backside silicon.",

    "abstract": "Zero-knowledge proof systems are widely used in different applications on the Internet. Among zero-knowledge proof systems, SNARKs are a popular choice because of their fast verification time and small proof size. The efficiency of zero-knowledge systems is crucial for usability, resulting in the development of so-called arithmetization-oriented ciphers.  In this work, we introduce Vision Mark-32, a modified instance of Vision defined over binary tower fields, with an optimized number of rounds and an efficient MDS matrix.  We implement a fully-pipelined Vision Mark-32 permutation on Alveo U55C FPGA accelerator card and argue an order of magnitude better hardware efficiency compared to the popular Poseidon hash. Our fully-pipelined Vision Mark-32 implementation runs at 250 MHz and uses 398 kLUT and 104 kFF.\r\nLastly, we delineate how to implement each step efficiently in hardware.",

    "abstract": "The NTRU problem has proven a useful building block for efficient bootstrapping in Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) schemes, and different such schemes have been proposed. FINAL (ASIACRYPT 2022) first constructed FHE using homomorphic multiplexer (CMux) gates for the blind rotation operation. Later, XZD+23 (CRYPTO 2023) gave an asymptotic optimization by changing the ciphertext format to enable ring automorphism evaluations. In this work, we examine an adaptation to FINAL to evaluate CMux gates of higher arity and the resulting tradeoff to running times and bootstrapping key sizes. In this setting, we can compare the time and space efficiency of both bootstrapping protocols with larger key space against each other and the state of the art.",

    "abstract": "Storage of sensitive multi-dimensional arrays must be secure and efficient in storage and processing time. Searchable encryption allows one to trade between security and efficiency. Searchable encryption design focuses on building indexes, overlooking the crucial aspect of record retrieval. Gui et al. (PoPETS 2023) showed that understanding the security and efficiency of record retrieval is critical to understand the overall system. A common technique for improving security is partitioning data tuples into parts. When a tuple is requested, the entire relevant part is retrieved, hiding the tuple of interest.\r\nThis work assesses tuple partitioning strategies in the dense data setting, considering parts that are random, $1$-dimensional, and multi-dimensional. We consider synthetic datasets of $2$, $3$ and $4$ dimensions, with sizes extending up to $2$M tuples. We compare security and efficiency across a variety of record retrieval methods. Our findings are:\r\n1. For most configurations, multi-dimensional partitioning yields better efficiency and less leakage.\r\n2. 1-dimensional partitioning outperforms multi-dimensional partitioning when the first (indexed) dimension is any size as long as the query is large in all other dimensions except the (the first dimension can be any size).\r\n3. The leakage of 1-dimensional partitioning is reduced the most when using a bucketed ORAM (Demertiz et al., USENIX Security 2020).",

    "abstract": "In this note, we improve the space-efficient variant of Regev's quantum factoring algorithm [Reg23] proposed by Ragavan and Vaikuntanathan [RV24] by constant factors in space and/or size. This allows us to bridge the significant gaps in concrete efficiency between the circuits by [Reg23] and [RV24]; [Reg23] uses far fewer gates, while [RV24] uses far fewer qubits.\r\n    \r\nThe main observation is that the space-efficient quantum modular exponentiation technique by [RV24] can be modified to work with more general sequences of integers than the Fibonacci numbers. We parametrize this in terms of a linear recurrence relation, and through this formulation construct three different circuits for quantum factoring:\r\n        - A circuit that uses $\\approx 10.4n$ qubits and $\\approx 45.7n^{1/2}$ multiplications of $n$-bit integers.\r\n        - A circuit that uses $(9+\\epsilon)n$ qubits and $O_\\epsilon(n^{1/2})$ multiplications of $n$-bit integers, for any $\\epsilon > 0$.\r\n        - A circuit that uses $(24+\\epsilon)n^{1/2}$ multiplications of $n$-bit integers, and $O_\\epsilon(n)$ qubits, for any $\\epsilon > 0$.\r\n\r\nIn comparison, the original circuit by [Reg23] uses at least $\\approx 3n^{3/2}$ qubits and $\\approx 6n^{1/2}$ multiplications of $n$-bit integers, while the space-efficient variant by [RV24] uses $\\approx 10.32n$ qubits and $\\approx 129.6n^{1/2}$ multiplications of $n$-bit integers (although a very simple modification of their Fibonacci-based circuit uses $\\approx 11.32n$ qubits and only $\\approx 86.4n^{1/2}$ multiplications of $n$-bit integers). The improvements proposed in this note take effect for sufficiently large values of $n$; it remains to be seen whether they can also provide benefits for practical problem sizes.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the feasibility of permissionless consensus (aka Byzantine agreement) under standard assumptions. A number of protocols have been proposed to achieve permissionless consensus, most notably based on the Bitcoin protocol; however, to date no protocol is known that can be provably instantiated outside of the random oracle model.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we take the first steps towards achieving permissionless consensus in the standard model. In particular, we demonstrate that worst-case conjectures in fine-grained complexity, in particular the orthogonal vectors conjecture (implied by the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis), imply permissionless consensus in the random beacon model\u2014a setting where a fresh random value is delivered to all parties at regular intervals. This gives a remarkable win-win result: either permissionless consensus exists relative to a random beacon, or there are non-trivial worst-case algorithmic speed-ups for a host of natural algorithmic problems (including SAT).\r\n\r\nOur protocol achieves resilience against adversaries that control an inverse-polynomial fraction of the honest computational power, i.e., adversarial power $A = T^{1\u2212\u03b5} $ for some constant $\u03b5 > 0$, where $T$ denotes the honest computational power. This relatively low threshold is a byproduct of the slack in the fine-grained complexity conjectures.\r\n\r\nOne technical highlight is the construction of a Seeded Proof of Work: a Proof of Work where many (correlated) challenges can be derived from a single short public seed, and yet still no non-trivial amortization is possible.",

    "abstract": "Machine-learning systems continue to advance at a rapid pace, demonstrating remarkable utility in various fields and disciplines. As these systems continue to grow in size and complexity, a nascent industry is emerging which aims to bring machine-learning-as-a-service (MLaaS) to market. Outsourcing the operation and training of these systems to powerful hardware carries numerous advantages, but challenges arise when privacy and the correctness of work carried out must be ensured. Recent advancements in the field of zero-knowledge cryptography have led to a means of generating arguments of integrity for any computation, which in turn can be efficiently verified by any party, in any place, at any time. In this work we prove the correct training of a differentially-private (DP) linear regression over a dataset of 50,000 samples on a single machine in less than 6 minutes, verifying the entire computation in 0.17 seconds. To our knowledge, this result represents the fastest known instance in the literature of provable-DP over a dataset of this size. We believe this result constitutes a key stepping-stone towards end-to-end private MLaaS.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we explore efficient ways to prove correctness of elliptic curve pairing relations. Pairing-based cryptographic protocols such as the Groth16 and Plonk SNARKs and the BLS signature scheme are used extensively in public blockchains such as Ethereum due in large part to their small size. However the relatively high cost of pairing computation remains a practical problem for many use cases such as verification ``in circuit\" inside a SNARK. This naturally arises in recursive SNARK composition and SNARKs of BLS based consensus protocols.\r\n\r\nTo improve pairing verification, we first show that the final exponentiation step of pairing verification can be replaced with a more efficient ``residue check,\" which can be incorporated into the Miller loop. Then, we show how to reduce the cost of the Miller loop by pre-computing all the necessary lines, and how this is especially efficient when the second pairing argument is fixed in advance. This is the case for BLS signatures with a fixed public key, as well as for KZG based SNARKs like Plonk and two of the three Groth16 pairings. Finally, we show how to improve of the protocol of [gar] by combining quotients, which allows us to more efficiently prove higher degree relations. These techniques also carry over naturally to pairing verification, for example on-chain verification or as part of the BitVM(2) protocol for Bitcoin smart contracts. We instantiate algorithms and show results for the BN254 curve.",

    "abstract": "We present Rondo, a scalable and reconfiguration-friendly distributed randomness beacon (DRB) protocol in the partially synchronous model. Rondo is the first DRB protocol that is built from batched asynchronous verifiable secret sharing (bAVSS) and meanwhile avoids the high $O(n^3)$ message cost, where $n$ is the number of nodes. Our key contribution lies in the introduction of a new variant of bAVSS called batched asynchronous verifiable secret sharing with partial output (bAVSS-PO). bAVSS-PO is a weaker primitive than bAVSS but allows us to build a secure and more scalable DRB protocol. We propose a bAVSS-PO protocol Breeze. Breeze achieves the optimal $O(n)$ messages for the sharing stage and allows Rondo to offer better scalability than prior DRB protocols.  \r\nAdditionally, to support the reconfiguration, we introduce Rondo-BFT, a dynamic and partially synchronous Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol inspired by Dyno (S\\&P 2022). Unlike Dyno, Rondo-BFT provides a communication pattern that generates randomness beacon output periodically, making it well-suited for DRB applications.\r\n\r\nWe implement our protocols and evaluate the performance on Amazon EC2 using up to 91 instances. Our evaluation results show that Rondo achieves higher throughput than existing works and meanwhile offers better scalability, where the performance does not degrade as significantly as $n$ grows.",

    "abstract": "We propose GraphOS, a system that allows a client that owns a graph database to outsource it to an untrusted server for storage and querying. It relies on doubly-oblivious primitives and trusted hardware to achieve a very strong privacy and efficiency notion which we call oblivious graph processing: the server learns nothing besides the number of graph vertexes and edges, and for each query its type and response size. At a technical level, GraphOS stores the graph on a doubly-oblivious data structure, so that all vertex/edge accesses are indistinguishable. For this purpose, we propose Omix++, a novel doubly-oblivious map that outperforms the previous state of the art by up to 34\u00d7, and may be of independent interest. Moreover, to avoid any leakage from CPU instruction fetching during query evaluation, we propose algorithms for four fundamental graph queries (BFS/DFS traversal, minimum spanning tree, and single-source shortest paths) that have a fixed execution trace, i.e., the sequence of executed operations is independent of the input. By combining these techniques, we eliminate all information that a hardware adversary observing the memory access pattern within the protected enclave can infer. We benchmarked GraphOS against the best existing solution, based on oblivious relational DBMS(translating graph queries to relational operators). GraphOS is not only significantly more performant (by up to two orders of magnitude for our tested graphs) but it eliminates leakage related to the graph topology that is practically inherent when a relational DBMS is used unless all operations are \u201cpadded\u201d to the worst case.",

    "abstract": "A verifiable random function (VRF) allows one to compute a random-looking image, while at the same time providing a unique proof that the function was evaluated correctly. VRFs are a cornerstone of modern cryptography and, among other applications, are at the heart of recently proposed proof-of-stake consensus protocols. In this work we initiate the formal study of aggregate VRFs, i.e., VRFs that allow for the aggregation of proofs/images into a small digest, whose size is independent of the number of input proofs/images, yet it still enables sound verification. We formalize this notion along with its security properties and we propose two constructions: The first scheme is conceptually simple, concretely efficient, and uses (asymmetric) bilinear groups of prime order. Pseudorandomness holds in the random oracle model and aggregate pseudorandomness is proven in the algebraic group model. The second scheme is in the standard model and it is proven secure against the learning with errors (LWE) problem.\r\n\r\nAs a cryptographic building block of independent interest, we introduce the notion of key homomorphic VRFs, where the verification keys and the proofs are endowed with a group structure. We conclude by discussing several applications of key-homomorphic and aggregate VRFs, such as distributed VRFs and aggregate proof-of-stake protocols.",

    "abstract": "Problems in the complexity class $NP$ are not all known to be solvable, but are verifiable given the solution, in polynomial time by a classical computer. The complexity class $BQP$ includes all problems solvable in polynomial time by a quantum computer. Prime factorization is in $NP$ class, and is also in $BQP$ class, owing to Shor's algorithm. The hardest of all problems within the $NP$ class are called $NP$-complete. If a quantum algorithm can solve an $NP$-complete problem in polynomial time, it would imply that a quantum computer can solve all problems in $NP$ in polynomial time. Here, we present a polynomial-time quantum algorithm to solve an $NP$-complete variant of the $SUBSET-SUM$ problem, thereby, rendering $NP\\subseteq BQP$. We illustrate that given a set of integers, which may be positive or negative, a quantum computer can decide in polynomial time whether there exists any subset that sums to zero. There are many real-world applications of our result, such as finding patterns efficiently in stock-market data, or in recordings of the weather or brain activity. As an example, the decision problem of matching two images in image processing is $NP$-complete, and can be solved in polynomial time, when amplitude amplification is not required.",

    "abstract": "he unique design of the FLIP cipher necessitated a generalization of standard cryptographic criteria for Boolean functions used in stream ciphers, prompting a focus on properties specific to subsets of $\\mathbb{F}_2^n$ rather than the entire set. This led to heightened interest in properties related to fixed Hamming weight sets and the corresponding partition of $\\mathbb{F}_2^n$ into n+1 such sets. Consequently, the concept of Weightwise Almost Perfectly Balanced (WAPB) functions emerged, which are balanced on each of these sets.Various studies have since proposed WAPB constructions and examined their cryptographic parameters for use in stream cipher filters.\r\n\r\nIn this article, we introduce a general approach to constructing WAPB functions using the concept of order, which simplifies implementation and enhances cryptographic strength. We present two new constructions: a recursive method employing multiple orders on binary strings, and another utilizing just two orders. We establish lower bounds for nonlinearity and weightwise nonlinearities within these classes. By instantiating specific orders, we demonstrate that some achieve minimal algebraic immunity, while others provide functions with guaranteed optimal algebraic immunity. Experimental results in 8 and 16 variables indicate that using orders based on field representation significantly outperforms other methods in terms of both global and weightwise algebraic immunity and nonlinearity. Additionally, we extend the recursive construction to create WAPB functions for any value of n, with experiments in 10, 12, and 14 variables confirming that these order-based functions exhibit robust cryptographic parameters. In particular, those based on field orders display optimal degrees and algebraic immunity, and strong weightwise nonlinearities and algebraic immunities.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) as a service has emerged as a rapidly expanding field across various industries like\r\nhealthcare, finance, marketing, retail and e-commerce, Industry 4.0, etc where a huge amount of data is gen-\r\nerated. To handle this amount of data, huge computational power is required for which cloud computing used\r\nto be the first choice. However, there are several challenges in cloud computing like limitations of bandwidth,\r\nnetwork connectivity, higher latency, etc. To address these issues, edge computing is prominent nowadays,\r\nwhere the data from sensor nodes is collected and processed on low-cost edge devices. As simple sensor\r\nnodes are not capable of handling complex computations of ML models, data from sensor nodes need to be\r\ntransferred to some nearest edge devices for further processing. If this sensor data is related to some security-\r\ncritical application, the privacy of such sensitive data needs to be preserved both during communication from\r\nsensor node to edge device and computation in edge nodes. This increased need to perform edge-based ML\r\non privacy-preserved data has led to a surge in interest in homomorphic encryption (HE) due to its ability to\r\nperform computations on encrypted form of data. The highest form of HE, Fully Homomorphic Encryption\r\n(FHE), is capable of theoretically handling arbitrary encrypted algorithms but comes with huge computational\r\noverhead. Hence, the implementation of such a complex encrypted ML model on a single edge node is not\r\nvery practical in terms of latency requirements. Our paper introduces a low-cost encrypted ML framework on\r\na distributed edge cluster, where multiple low-cost edge devices (Raspberry Pi boards) are clustered to perform\r\nencrypted distributed K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm computations. Our experimental result shows,\r\nKNN prediction on standard Wisconsin breast cancer dataset takes approximately 1.2 hours, implemented on\r\na cluster of six pi boards, maintaining end-to-end data confidentiality of critical medical data without any re-\r\nquirement of costly cloud-based computation resource support",

    "abstract": "Group signatures and their variants have been widely used in privacy-sensitive scenarios such as anonymous authentication and attestation. In this paper, we present a new post-quantum group signature scheme from symmetric primitives. Using only symmetric primitives makes the scheme less prone to unknown attacks than basing the design on newly proposed hard problems whose security is less well-understood. However, symmetric primitives do not have rich algebraic properties, and this makes it extremely challenging to design a group signature scheme on top of them. It is even more challenging if we want a group signature scheme suitable for real-world applications, one that can support large groups and require few trust assumptions. Our scheme is based on MPC-in-the-head non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, and we specifically design a novel hash-based group credential scheme, which is rooted in the SPHINCS+ signature scheme but with various modifications to make it MPC (multi-party computation) friendly. The security of the scheme has been proved under the fully dynamic group signature model. We provide an implementation of the scheme and demonstrate the feasibility of handling a group size as large as $2^{60}$. This is the first group signature scheme from symmetric primitives that supports such a large group size and meets all the security requirements.",

These standardised DAA schemes have their security based on the factoring or discrete logarithm problems and are therefore insecure against quantum attackers. Research into quantum-resistant DAA has resulted in several lattice-based schemes. Now in this paper, we propose the first post-quantum DAA scheme from symmetric primitives. We make use of a hash-based signature scheme, which is a slight modification of SPHINCS+, as a DAA credential. A DAA signature, proving  the possession of such a credential, is a multiparty computation-based non-interactive zero-knowledge proof. The security of our scheme is proved under the Universal Composability (UC) model. While maintaining all the security properties required for a DAA scheme, we try to make the TPM's workload as low as possible. Our DAA scheme can handle a large group size (up to $2^{60}$ group members), which meets the requirements of rapidly developing TPM applications.",

    "abstract": "The elliptic curve-based Enhanced Privacy ID (EPID) signature scheme is broadly used for hardware enclave attestation by many platforms that implement Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) and other devices. This scheme has also been included in the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) specifications and ISO/IEC standards. However, it is insecure against quantum attackers. While research into quantum-resistant EPID has resulted in several lattice-based schemes, Boneh et al. have initiated the study of EPID signature schemes built only from symmetric primitives. We observe that for this line of research, there is still room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a new hash-based EPID scheme, which includes a novel and efficient signature revocation scheme. In addition, our scheme can handle a large group size (up to $2^{60}$ group members), which meets the requirements of rapidly developing hardware enclave attestation applications.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive security analysis of the Adh zero-knowledge proof system, a novel lattice-based, quantum-resistant proof of possession system. The Adh system offers compact key and proof sizes, making it suitable for real-world digital signature and public key agreement protocols. We explore its security by reducing it to the hardness of the Module-ISIS problem and introduce three new variants: Module-ISIS+, Module-ISIS*, and Module-ISIS**. These constructions enhance security through variations on chaining mechanisms. We also provide a reduction to the module modulus subset sum problem under conservative assumptions.\r\n\r\nEmpirical evidence and statistical testing support the zero-knowledge, completeness, and soundness properties of the Adh proof system. Comparative analysis demonstrates the Adh system's advantages in terms of key and proof sizes over existing post-quantum schemes like Kyber and Dilithium.\r\n\r\nThis paper represents an early preprint and is a work in progress. The core security arguments and experimental results are present, and formal proofs and additional analysis are provided. We invite feedback and collaboration from the research community to further strengthen the security foundations of the Adh system and explore its potential applications in quantum-resistant cryptography.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) protocols integrate a partially-synchronous optimistic path. The holy grail in this paradigm is to match the performance of a partially-synchronous protocol in favorable situations and match the performance of a purely asynchronous protocol in unfavorable situations. Several prior works have made progress toward this goal by matching the efficiency of a partially-synchronous protocol in favorable conditions. However, their performance compared to purely asynchronous protocols is reduced when network conditions are unfavorable. To address these shortcomings, a recent work, Abraxas (CCS'23), presents the first optimistic asynchronous BFT protocol that retains stable throughput in all situations. However, Abraxas still incurs very high worst-case latency in unfavorable situations because it is slow at detecting the failure of its optimistic path. Another recent work, ParBFT (CCS'23) guarantees good latency in all situations, but suffers from reduced throughput in unfavorable situations due to its use of extra Asynchronous Binary Agreement (ABA) instances.\r\n\r\nTo approach our holy grail, we propose Aether, which delivers performance comparable to partially-synchronous protocols in favorable situations, and attains performance on par with purely asynchronous protocols in unfavorable situations\u2014in both throughput and latency. Aether also runs the two paths simultaneously. It adopts two-chain HotStuff as the optimistic path, thus achieving high performance in favorable situations. As for the pessimistic path, we introduce a new primitive Dual-functional Byzantine Agreement (DBA), which packs the functionalities of biased ABA and Validated Asynchronous Byzantine Agreement (VABA). Aether runs DBA instances continuously as the pessimistic path. DBA\u2019s ABA functionality quickly detects the optimistic path\u2019s failure, ensuring Aether\u2019s low latency in unfavorable situations. Meanwhile, the VABA functionality continuously produces blocks, maintaining Aether\u2019s high throughput. Additionally, the biased property ensures that blocks committed via the optimistic path are respected by DBA instances, guaranteeing consistency across two paths. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that Aether achieves high throughput and low latency in all situations.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel protocol for privacy-preserving biometric identification, named Monchi, that combines the use of homomorphic encryption for the computation of the identification score with function secret sharing to obliviously compare this score with a given threshold and finally output the binary result. Given the cost of homomorphic encryption, BFV in this solution, we study and evaluate the integration of two packing solutions that enable the regrouping of multiple templates in one ciphertext to improve efficiency meaningfully. We propose an end-to-end protocol, prove it secure and implement it. Our experimental results attest to Monchi's applicability to the real-life use case of an airplane boarding scenario with 1000 passengers,taking less than one second to authorize/deny access to the plane to each passenger via biometric identification while maintaining the privacy of all passengers.",

    "abstract": "Homomorphic signatures allow to validate computation on signed data. Alice, holding a dataset, $\\{m_1 , \\ldots , m_t \\}$ uses her secret key $\\sf sk$ to sign these data and stores the authenticated dataset on a remote server. The server can later (publicly) compute $m = f(m_1,...,m_t)$ together with a signature $\\sigma$ certifying that $m$ is indeed the correct output of the computation $f$. Over the last fifteen years, the problem of realizing homomorphic signatures has been the focus of numerous research works, with constructions now ranging from very efficient ones supporting linear functions to very expressive ones supporting (up to) arbitrary circuits. In this work we tackle the question of assessing the practicality of schemes belonging to this latter class. Specifically, we implement the GVW lattice based scheme for circuits from STOC 2015 and two, recently proposed, pairings based constructions building from functional commitments. Our experiments show that (both) pairings based schemes outperform GVW on all fronts.",

    "abstract": "Cryptographic accumulators, introduced in 1993 by Benaloh and De\r\nMare, represent a set with a concise value and offer proofs of (non-)membership. Accumulators have evolved, becoming essential in anonymous credentials, e-cash, and blockchain applications. Various properties like dynamic and universal emerged for specific needs, leading to multiple accumulator definitions. In 2015, Derler, Hanser, and Slamanig proposed a unified model, but new properties, including zero-knowledge security, have arisen since. We offer a new definition of accumulators, based on Derler et al.\u2019s, that is suitable for all properties. We also introduce a new security property, unforgeability of private evaluation, to protect accumulator from forgery and we verify this property in Barthoulot, Blazy, and Canard\u2019s recent accumulator. Finally we provide discussions on security properties of accumulators and on the delegatable (non-)membership proofs property.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of lower bounding any given cost function depending on the false positive and false negative probabilities of adversaries against indistinguishability security notions in symmetric-key cryptography. We take the cost model as an input, so that this becomes a purely information-theoretical question.\r\n\r\nWe propose power bounds as an easy-to-use alternative for advantage bounds in the context of indistinguishability with asymmetric cost functions. We show that standard proof techniques such as hybrid arguments and the H-coefficient method can be generalized to the power model, and apply these techniques to the PRP-PRF switching lemma, the Even-Mansour (EM) construction, and the sum-of-permutations (SoP) construction.\r\n\r\nAs the final and perhaps most useful contribution, we provide two methods to convert single-user power bounds into multi-user power bounds, and investigate their relation to the point-wise proximity method of Hoang and Tessaro (Crypto 2016). These method are applied to obtain tight multi-user power bounds for EM and SoP.",

    "abstract": "Topic modelling refers to a popular set of techniques used to discover hidden topics that occur in a collection of documents. These topics can, for example, be used to categorize documents or label text for further processing. One popular topic modelling technique is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). In topic modelling scenarios, the documents are often assumed to be in one, centralized dataset. However, sometimes documents are held by different parties, and contain privacy- or commercially-sensitive information that cannot be shared.\r\nWe present a novel, decentralized approach to train an LDA model securely without having to share any information about the content of the documents with the other parties. We preserve the privacy of the individual parties using a combination of privacy enhancing technologies.\r\nWe show that our decentralized, privacy preserving LDA solution has a similar accuracy compared to an (insecure) centralised approach. With $1024$-bit Paillier keys, a topic model with $5$ topics and $3000$ words can be trained in around $16$ hours. Furthermore, we show that the solution scales linearly in the total number of words and the number of topics.",

    "abstract": "Functional Encryption (FE) allows users to extract specific function-related information from encrypted data while preserving the privacy of the underlying plaintext. Though significant research has been devoted to developing secure and efficient Multi-Input Functional Encryption schemes supporting diverse functions, there remains a noticeable research gap in the development of verifiable FE schemes. Functionality and performance have received considerable attention, however, the crucial aspect of verifiability in FE has been relatively understudied. Another important aspect that prior research in FE with outsourced decryption has not adequately addressed is the fairness of the data-for-money exchange between a curator and an analyst. This paper focuses on addressing these gaps by proposing a verifiable FE scheme for inner product computation. The scheme not only supports the multi-client setting but also extends its functionality to accommodate multiple users -- an essential feature in modern privacy-respecting services. Additionally, it demonstrates how this FE scheme can be effectively utilized to ensure fairness and atomicity in a payment protocol, further enhancing the trustworthiness of data exchanges.",

    "abstract": "We present two techniques to improve the computational and/or communication costs of STARK proofs: packing and modular split-and-pack. \r\n \r\nPacking allows to generate a single proof of the satisfiability of several constraints. We achieve this by packing the evaluations of all relevant polynomials in the same Merkle leaves, and combining all DEEP FRI functions into a single randomized validity function. Our  benchmarks show that packing  reduces the verification time and proof size compared to individually proving the satisfiability of each witness, while only increasing the prover time moderately. \r\n    \r\nModular split-and-pack is a proof acceleration technique where the prover divides a witness  into smaller sub-witnesses. It then uses packing to prove the simultaneous satisfiability of each sub-witness. Compared to producing a proof of the original witness, splitting improves the prover time and memory usage, while increasing the verifier time and proof size. Ideas similar to modular split-and-pack seem to be used throughout the industry, but 1) generally execution traces are split by choosing the first $k$ rows, then the next $k$ rows, and so on; and 2) full recursion is used to prove the simultaneous satisfiability of the sub-witnesses, usually combined with a final wrapper proof (typically a Groth16 proof). We present a different way to split the witness that allows for an efficient re-writing of Plonkish-type constraints. Based on our benchmarks, we believe this approach (together with a wrapper proof)  can improve upon existing splitting methods, resulting in a faster prover at essentially no cost in proof size and verification time. \r\n\r\nBoth techniques apply to popular FRI-based proof systems such as ethSTARK, Plonky2/3, RISC Zero, and Boojum.",

    "abstract": "Privacy-preserving decision tree evaluation (PDTE) allows a client that holds feature vectors to perform inferences against a decision tree model on the server side without revealing feature vectors to the server. Our work focuses on the non-interactive batched setting where the client sends a batch of encrypted feature vectors and then obtains classifications, without any additional interaction. This is useful in privacy-preserving credit scoring, biometric authentication, and many more applications.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose two novel non-interactive batched PDTE protocols, OursRCC and OursCW, based on two batched ciphertext-plaintext comparison algorithms, our batched range cover comparison (RCC) comparator and the constant-weight (CW) piece-wise comparator, respectively. When comparing 16-bit batched encrypted values to a single plaintext value, our comparison algorithms show a speedup of up to $72\\times$ compared to the state-of-the-art Level Up (CCS'23). Moreover, we introduced a new tree traversal method called adapted SumPath, to achieve $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity of the server's response, whereas Level Up has $\\mathcal{O}(2^d)$ complexity for a depth-$d$ tree and the client needs to look up classification values in a table.\r\n\r\nOverall, our PDTE protocols attain the optimal server-to-client communication complexity and are up to $17\\times$ faster than Level Up in batch size 16384.",

    "abstract": "Vector Commitment (VC) enables one to commit to a vector, and then the element at a specific position can be opened, with proof of consistency to the initial commitment. VC is a powerful primitive with various applications, including stateless cryptocurrencies. Recently, matrix commitment Matproofs (Liu and Zhang CCS 2022), as an extension of VC, has been proposed to reduce the communication and computation complexity of VC-based cryptocurrencies. However, Matproofs requires linear-sized public parameters, and the aggregated proof size may also increase linearly with the number of individual proofs aggregated. Additionally, the proof updating process involves the third party, known as Proof-Serving Nodes (PSNs), which leads to extra storage and communication overhead. In this paper, we first propose a multi-dimensional variant of matrix commitment and construct a new matrix commitment scheme for two-dimensional matrix, called 2D-Xproofs, which achieves optimal aggregated proof size without using PSNs. Furthermore, we present a highly maintainable three-dimensional scheme, 3D-Xproofs, which updates all proofs within time sublinear in the size of the committed matrix without PSNs' assistance. More generally, we could further increase the matrix dimensionality to achieve more efficient proof updates. Finally, we demonstrate the security of our schemes, showing that both schemes are position binding. We also implement both schemes, and the results indicate that our schemes enjoy constant-sized aggregated proofs and sublinear-sized public parameters, and the proof update time in 3D-Xproofs is $2.5\\times$ faster than Matproofs.",

    "abstract": "Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols are known to suffer from the scalability issue. Indeed, their performance degrades drastically as the number of replicas $n$ grows. While a long line of work has attempted to achieve the scalability goal, these works can only scale to roughly a hundred replicas. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we develop BFT protocols from the so-called committee sampling approach that selects a small committee for consensus and conveys the results to all replicas. Such an approach, however, has been focused on the Byzantine agreement (BA) problem (considering replicas only) instead of the BFT problem (in the client-replica model); also, the approach is mainly of theoretical interest only, as concretely, it works for impractically large $n$. \r\n\r\nWe build an extremely efficient, scalable, and adaptively secure BFT protocol called Pando in partially synchronous environments based on the committee sampling approach. In particular, we devise novel BFT building blocks targeting scalability, including communication-efficient and computation-efficient consistent broadcast and atomic broadcast protocols. \r\n\r\nPando inherits some inherent issues of committee sampling-based protocols: Pando can only achieve near-optimal resilience (i.e., $f<(1/3-\\epsilon)n$, where $f$ is the number of faulty replicas and $\\epsilon$ is a small constant), and Pando attains safety and liveness only probabilistically. Interestingly, to make $\\epsilon$ come close to $0$ (near-optimal resilience), $n$ needs to be sufficiently large but not impractically large, e.g., $n>500$---just what we need for scalable BFT. \r\n\r\nOur evaluation on  Amazon EC2 shows that in contrast to existing protocols, Pando can easily scale to a thousand replicas in the WAN environment, achieving a throughput of $62.57$ ktx/sec.",

    "abstract": "Certain applications such as FHE transciphering require randomness while operating over encrypted data. This randomness has to be obliviously generated in the encrypted domain and remain encrypted throughout the computation. Moreover, it should be guaranteed that independent-looking random coins can be obliviously generated for different computations.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we consider the homomorphic evaluation of pseudorandom functions (PRFs) with a focus on practical lattice-based candidates. In the homomorphic PRF evaluation setting, given a fully homomorphic encryption of the PRF secret key $\\vec{s}$, it should be possible to homomorphically compute encryptions of PRF evaluations $\\{ \\text{PRF}_{\\vec{s}}(x_i) \\}_{i=1}^M$ for public inputs $\\{ x_i\\}_{i=1}^M$.  We consider this problem for PRF families based on the hardness of the Learning-With-Rounding (LWR) problem introduced by Banerjee, Peikert and Rosen (Eurocrypt '12). We build on the random-oracle variant of a PRF construction suggested by Banerjee et al. and demonstrate that it can be evaluated using only two sequential programmable bootstraps in the TFHE homomorphic encryption scheme. We also describe several modifications of this PRF---which we prove as secure as the original function---that support homomorphic evaluations using only one programmable bootstrap per slot.  \r\n\r\nNumerical experiments were conducted using practically relevant FHE parameter sets from the TFHE-rs library.  Our benchmarks show that a throughput of about $1000$ encrypted pseudorandom bits per second (resp. $900$ encrypted pseudorandom bits per second) can be achieved on an AWS hpc7a.96xlarge machine (resp. on a standard laptop with an Apple M2 chip), on a single thread. The PRF evaluation keys in our experiments have sizes roughly $40\\%$ and $60\\%$ of a bootstrapping key. Applying our solution to transciphering enables important bandwidth savings, typically trading $64$-bit values for $4$-bit values per transmitted ciphertext.",

    "abstract": "We present Whisper, a system for privacy-preserving collection of aggregate statistics. Like prior systems, a Whisper deployment consists of a small set of non-colluding servers; these servers compute aggregate statistics over data from a large number of users without learning the data of any individual user. Whisper\u2019s main contribution is that its server- to-server communication cost and its server-side storage costs scale sublinearly with the total number of users. In particular, prior systems required the servers to exchange a few bits of information to verify the well-formedness of each client submission. In contrast, Whisper uses silently verifiable proofs, a new type of proof system on secret-shared data that allows the servers to verify an arbitrarily large batch of proofs by exchanging a single 128-bit string. This improvement comes with increased client-to-server communication, which, in cloud computing, is typically cheaper (or even free) than the cost of egress for server-to-server communication. To reduce server storage, Whisper approximates certain statistics using small-space sketching data structures. Applying randomized sketches in an environment with adversarial clients requires a careful and novel security analysis. In a deployment with two servers and 100,000 clients of which 1% are malicious, Whisper can improve server-to-server communication for vector sum by three orders of magnitude while each client\u2019s communication increases by only 10%.",

    "abstract": "To introduce a post-quantum-secure encryption scheme specifically for use in flight-computers, we used avionics\u2019 module-isolation methods to wrap a recent encryption standard (HPKE \u2013 Hybrid Public Key Encryption) within a software partition. This solution proposes an upgrade to HPKE, using quantum-resistant ciphers (Kyber/ML-KEM and Dilithium/ML-DSA) redundantly alongside well-established ciphers, to achieve post-quantum security.\r\n\r\nBecause cryptographic technology can suddenly become obsolete as attacks become more sophisticated, \"crypto-agility\" -\u2013 the ability to swiftly replace ciphers \u2013 represents the key challenge to deployment of software like ours. Partitioning is a crucial method for establishing such agility, as it enables the replacement of compromised software without affecting software on other partitions, greatly simplifying the certification process necessary in an avionics environment.\r\n\r\nOur performance measurements constitute initial evidence that both the memory and performance characteristics of this approach are suitable for deployment in flight-computers currently in use. Prior to optimisation, performance measurements show a modest memory requirement of under 400 KB of RAM, but employ a more substantial stack usage of just under 200 KB. Our most advanced redundant post-quantum cipher is five times slower than its non-redundant, pre-quantum counterpart.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the optimal transaction fee mechanisms for blockchains, focusing on the distinction between price-based ($\\mathcal{P}$) and quantity-based ($\\mathcal{Q}$) controls. By analyzing factors such as demand uncertainty, validator costs, cryptocurrency price fluctuations, price elasticity of demand, and levels of decentralization, we establish criteria that determine the selection of transaction fee mechanisms. We present a model framed around a Nash bargaining game, exploring how blockchain designers and validators negotiate fee structures to balance network welfare with profitability. Our findings suggest that the choice between $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{Q}$ mechanisms depends critically on the blockchain\u2019s specific technical and economic features. The study concludes that no single mechanism suits all contexts and highlights the potential for hybrid approaches that adaptively combine features of both $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{Q}$ to meet varying demands and market conditions.",

    "abstract": "With the rising popularity of DeFi applications it is important to implement protections for regular users of these DeFi platforms against large parties with massive amounts of resources allowing them to engage in market manipulation strategies such as frontrunning/backrunning. Moreover, there are many situations (such as recovery of funds from vulnerable smart contracts) where a user may not want to reveal their transaction until it has been executed. As such, it is clear that preserving the privacy of transactions in the mempool is an important goal.\r\n\r\nIn this work we focus on achieving mempool transaction privacy through a new primitive that we term batched-threshold encryption, which is a variant of threshold encryption with strict efficiency requirements to better model the needs of resource constrained environments such as blockchains. Unlike the naive use of threshold encryption, which requires communication proportional to $O(nB)$ to decrypt $B$ transactions with a committee of $n$ parties, our batched-threshold encryption scheme only needs $O(n)$ communication. We additionally discuss pitfalls in prior approaches that use (vanilla) threshold encryption for mempool privacy.\r\n\r\nTo show that our scheme is concretely efficient, we implement our scheme and find that transactions can be encrypted in under 6 ms, independent of committee size, and the communication required to decrypt an entire batch of $B$ transactions is 80 bytes per party, independent of the number of transactions $B$, making it an attractive choice when communication is very expensive. If deployed on Ethereum, which processes close to 500 transaction per block, it takes close to 2.8 s for each committee member to compute a partial decryption and under 3.5 s to decrypt all transactions for a block in single-threaded mode.",

    "abstract": "This paper endeavors to securely implement a Physical Unclonable\r\nFunction (PUF) for private data generation within Field-Programmable\r\nGate Arrays (FPGAs). SRAM PUFs are commonly utilized due to their\r\nuse of memory devices for generating secret data, particularly in resource constrained devices. However, their reliance on memory access poses side-channel threats such as data remanence decay and memory-based attacks, and the time required to generate secret data is significant. To address these issues, we propose implementing n cross-coupled inverters in Verilog to generate n secret bits, followed by syndrome for error correction hardcoded in the hardware itself. This approach improves side channel security and reduces time consumption, albeit at the expense of additional area utilization",

    "abstract": "Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is becoming a standard collaborative learning paradigm with various practical applications. Randomness is essential to enhancing privacy in VFL, but introducing too much external randomness often leads to an intolerable performance loss. Instead, as it was demonstrated for other federated learning settings, leveraging internal randomness \u2014as provided by variational autoencoders (VAEs) \u2014can be beneficial. However, the resulting privacy has never been quantified so far, nor has the approach been investigated for VFL.\r\nWe therefore propose a novel differential privacy (DP) estimate, denoted as distance-based empirical local differential privacy (dELDP). It allows us to empirically bound DP parameters of models or model components, quantifying the internal randomness with appropriate distance and sensitivity metrics. We apply dELDP to investigate the DP of VAEs and observe values up to \u03b5 \u2248 6.4 and \u03b4 = 2\u221232. Based on this, to link the dELDP parameters to the privacy of VAE-including VFL systems in practice, we conduct comprehensive experiments on the robustness against state-of-the-art privacy attacks. The results illustrate that the VAE system is robust against feature reconstruction attacks and outperforms other privacy-enhancing methods for VFL, especially when the adversary holds 75% of the features during label inference attacks.",

    "abstract": "We consider two critical aspects of security in the distributed computing (DC) model: secure data shuffling and secure coded computing. It is imperative that any external entity overhearing the communication does not gain any information about the intermediate values (IVs) exchanged during the shuffling phase of the DC model. Our approach ensures IV confidentiality during data shuffling. Moreover, each node in the system must be able to recover the IVs necessary for computing its output functions but must also remain oblivious to the IVs associated with output functions not assigned to it. We design secure DC methods and establish achievable limits on the tradeoffs between the communication and computation loads to contribute to the advancement of secure data processing in distributed systems. First, we establish that the computation and communication loads stay the same as for  non-secure data shuffling. However, implementing secure data shuffling requires additional overhead for storing secret keys at the nodes. Next, we show that for secure coded computation, both the computation and communication loads increase compared to the non-secure scenario, along with the overhead for storing secret keys. Finally, we extend our security results to a novel distributed computing model known as multi-access distributed computing (MADC), which was recently introduced. The MADC model  features two distinct sets of nodes, namely mapper and reducer nodes. Unlike the original setting where mapper and reducer nodes were the same, in this model, they are separate entities, and each reducer node is connected to multiple mapper nodes. We show that, for MADC models also, the computation and communication loads remain the same with or without secure data shuffling. However, secure coded computation results in increased computation and communication loads compared to the non-secure case, and both scenarios require overhead for storing secret keys at the reducer nodes.",

    "abstract": "The TFHE cryptosystem only supports small plaintext space, up to 5 bits with usual parameters. However, one solution to circumvent this limitation is to decompose input messages into a basis B over multiple ciphertexts. In this work, we introduce B-gates, an extension of logic gates to non binary bases, to compute base B logic circuit. The flexibility introduced by our approach improves the speed performance over previous approaches such as the so called tree-based method which requires an exponential amount of operations in the number of inputs. We provide experimental results using sorting as a benchmark application and, additionally, we obtain a speed-up of \u00d73 in latency compared to state of the art BGV techniques for this application. As an additional result, we introduce a keyswitching key specific to packing TLWE ciphertexts into TRLWE ciphertexts with redundancy, which is of interest in many functional bootstrapping scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Foreign field arithmetic often creates significant additional overheads in zero-knowledge proof circuits. Previous work has offloaded foreign arithmetic from proof circuits by using effective and often simple primitives such as Sigma protocols. While these successfully move the foreign field work outside of the circuit, the costs for the Sigma protocol\u2019s verifier still remains high. In use cases where the verifier is constrained computationally this poses a major challenge. One such use case would be in proof composition where foreign arithmetic causes a blowup in the costs for the verifier circuit. In this work we show that by using folding scheme with Sigmabus and other such uniform verifier offloading techniques, we can remove foreign field arithmetic from zero-knowledge proof circuits while achieving succinct final verification. We do this by applying prior techniques iteratively and accumulate the resulting verifier work into one folding proof of size O(|F|) group elements, where F is the size of a single Sigma verifier\u2019s computation. Then by using an existing zkSNARK we can further compress to a proof size of O(log |F|) which can be checked succinctly by a computationally constrained verifier.",

    "abstract": "Introduced by Kohlweiss, Lysyanskaya, and Nguyen (Eurocrypt'23), an $f$-privacy-preserving blueprint (PPB) system allows an auditor with secret input $x$ to create a public encoding of the function $f(x,\\cdot)$ that verifiably corresponds to a commitment $C_x$ to $x$.  The auditor will then be able to derive $f(x,y)$ from an escrow $Z$ computed by a user on input the user's private data $y$ corresponding to a commitment $C_y$.  $Z$ verifiably corresponds to the commitment $C_y$ and reveals no other information about $y$.  \r\n\r\nPPBs provide an abuse-resistant escrow mechanism: for example, if $f$ is the watchlist function where $f(x,y)$ outputs $y$ only in the event that $y$ is on the list $x$, then an $f$-PPB allows the auditor to trace watchlisted users in an otherwise anonymous system.  Yet, the auditor's $x$ must correspond to a publicly available  $C_x$ (authorized by a transparent, lawful process), and the auditor will learn nothing except $f(x,y)$.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we build on the original PPB results in three ways: (1) We define and satisfy a stronger notion of security where a malicious auditor cannot frame a user in a transaction to which this user was not a party. (2) We provide efficient schemes for a bigger class of functions $f$; for example, for the first time, we show how to realize $f$ that would allow the auditor to trace e-cash transactions of a criminal suspect. (3) For the watchlist and related functions, we reduce the size of the escrow $Z$ from linear in the size of the auditor's input $x$, to logarithmic.\r\n\r\nOf independent interest, we develop a new framework for succinctly verifiable computation over additively-homomorphically encrypted data.",

    "abstract": "Time-lock puzzles are unique cryptographic primitives that use computational complexity to keep information secret for some period of time, after which security expires. Unfortunately, twenty-five  years after their introduction, current analysis techniques of time-lock primitives provide no sound mechanism to build multi-party cryptographic  protocols which use expiring security as a building block. As pointed out recently in the peer-reviewed literature, current attempts at this  problem lack either composability, a fully consistent analysis, or functionality.\r\n\r\nThis paper presents a new complexity theoretic based framework and new structural theorems to analyze timed primitives with full generality and in composition (which is the central modular protocol design tool).  The framework includes a model of security based on fine-grained circuit complexity which we call ``residual complexity,'' which accounts for possible leakage on timed primitives as they expire. Our definitions for multi-party computation  protocols generalize the literature standards by accounting for fine-grained polynomial circuit depth to model computational hardness which expires in feasible time. Our composition theorems, in turn, incur degradation of (fine-grained) security as items are composed. In our framework, simulators are given a polynomial ``budget\" for computational depth, and in composition these polynomials interact.\r\n\r\nFinally, we demonstrate via a prototypical auction application how to apply our framework and theorems. For the first time, we show that it is possible to prove -- in a way that is fully consistent, with falsifiable assumptions -- properties of multi-party applications based on leaky, temporarily secure  components. \r\n\r\nThis work therefore significantly extends provable cryptography down from the self-contained world of arbitrary-polynomial security to the realm of small time domains which often appear in practice, where security of components expires while the larger system remains secure.",

    "abstract": "Byzantine consensus is a fundamental building block in distributed cryptographic problems. Despite decades of research, most existing asynchronous consensus protocols require a strong trusted setup and expensive public-key cryptography. In this paper, we study asynchronous Byzantine consensus protocols that do not rely on a trusted setup and do not use public-key cryptography such as digital signatures. We give an Asynchronous Common Subset (ACS) protocol whose security is only based on cryptographic hash functions modeled as a random oracle. Our protocol has $O(\\kappa n^3)$ total communication and runs in expected $O(1)$ rounds. The fact that we use only cryptographic hash functions also means that our protocol is post-quantum secure. The minimal use of cryptography and the small number of rounds make our protocol practical. We implement our protocol and evaluate it in a geo-distributed setting with up to 128  machines. Our experimental evaluation shows that our protocol is more efficient than the only other setup-free consensus protocol that has been implemented to date. En route to our asynchronous consensus protocols, we also introduce new primitives called asynchronous secret key sharing and cover gather, which may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "WebAuthn is a passwordless authentication protocol which allows users to authenticate to online services using public-key cryptography. Users prove their identity by signing a challenge with a private key, which is stored on a device such as a cell phone or a USB security token. This approach avoids many of the common security problems with password-based authentication.\r\n\r\nWebAuthn's reliance on proof-of-possession leads to a usability issue, however: a user who loses access to their authenticator device either loses access to their accounts or is required to fall back on a weaker authentication mechanism. To solve this problem, Yubico has proposed a protocol which allows a user to link two tokens in such a way that one (the primary authenticator) can generate public keys on behalf of the other (the backup authenticator). With this solution, users authenticate with a single token, only relying on their backup token if necessary for account recovery. However, Yubico's protocol relies on the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem for its security and hence is vulnerable to an attacker with a powerful enough quantum computer.\r\n\r\nWe present a WebAuthn recovery protocol which can be instantiated with quantum-safe primitives. We also critique the security model used in previous analysis of Yubico's protocol and propose a new framework which we use to evaluate the security of both the group-based and the quantum-safe protocol. This leads us to uncover a weakness in Yubico's proposal which escaped detection in prior work but was revealed by our model. In our security analysis, we require the cryptographic primitives underlying the protocols to satisfy a number of novel security properties such as KEM unlinkability, which we formalize. We prove that well-known quantum-safe algorithms, including CRYSTALS-Kyber, satisfy the properties required for analysis of our quantum-safe protocol.",

The form is public, but the construction is a trapdoor that depends on the scheme's private key. For polynomial rings over integers and rings of integers of algebraic number fields, the cryptanalysis is reducible to solving a quadratic Diophantine equation over the ring or, equivalently, to solving a system of quadratic Diophantine equations over rational integers. It is still an open problem whether quantum computers will have any advantage in solving Diophantine problems.",

    "abstract": "We construct an efficient proxy re-encryption (PRE) scheme secure against honest re-encryption attacks (HRA-secure) with precise concrete security estimates. To get these precise concrete security estimates, we introduce the tight, fine-grained noise-flooding techniques of Li et al. (CRYPTO'22) to RLWE-based (homomorphic) PRE schemes, as well as a mixed statistical-computational security to HRA security analysis.  Our solution also supports homomorphic  operations on the ciphertexts. Such homomorphism allows for advanced applications, e.g., encrypted computation of network statistics across networks and unlimited hops, in the case of full homomorphism, i.e., bootstrapping.\r\n\r\nWe  implement our PRE scheme in the OpenFHE software library and  apply it to a problem of secure multi-hop data distribution in the context of 5G virtual network slices. We also experimentally evaluate the performance of our scheme, demonstrating that the implementation is practical.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, we compare our PRE method with other lattice-based PRE schemes and approaches to achieve HRA security. These achieve HRA security, but not in a tight, practical scheme such as our work. Further, we present an attack on the PRE scheme proposed in Davidson et al.'s (ACISP'19), which was claimed to achieve HRA security without noise flooding.",

    "abstract": "Private Set Intersection (PSI) is a protocol where two parties with individually held confidential sets want to jointly learn (or secret-share) the intersection of these two sets and reveal nothing else to each other. In this paper, we introduce a natural extension of this notion to approximate matching. Specifically, given  a distance metric between elements, an approximate PSI (Approx-PSI) allows to run PSI where ``close'' elements match. Assuming that elements are either ``close'' or sufficiently ``far apart'',  we present an Approx-PSI protocol for Hamming distance that improves the overall efficiency compared to all existing approximate-PSI solutions. In particular, we achieve a near-linear $\\tilde{O}(n)$ communication complexity, an improvement over the previously best-known $\\tilde{O}(n^2)$. We also show Approx-PSI protocols for Edit distance (also known as Levenstein distance), Euclidean distance and angular distance by deploying results on low distortion embeddings to Hamming distance. The latter two results further imply secure Approx-PSI for other metrics such as cosine similarity metric. Our Approx-PSI for Hamming distance is up to 20x faster and communicating 30% less than best known protocols when (1) matching small binary vectors; or (2) matching large threshold; or (3) matching large input sets. We also apply our technique to analyze private approximate membership computation, which can be viewed as asymmetric case of approximate PSI, and obtain a protocol with sublinear communication.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, many blockchain systems have progressively transitioned to proof-of-stake (PoS) con- sensus algorithms. These algorithms are not only more energy efficient than proof-of-work but are also well-studied and widely accepted within the community. However, PoS systems are susceptible to a particularly powerful \"long-range\" attack, where an adversary can corrupt the validator set retroactively and present forked versions of the blockchain. These versions would still be acceptable to clients, thereby creating the potential for double-spending. Several methods and research efforts have proposed counter- measures against such attacks. Still, they often necessitate modifications to the underlying blockchain, introduce heavy assumptions such as centralized entities, or prove inefficient for securely bootstrapping light clients.\r\nIn this work, we propose a method of defending against these attacks with the aid of external servers running our protocol. Our method does not require any soft or hard-forks on the underlying blockchain and operates under reasonable assumptions, specifically the requirement of at least one honest server.\r\nCentral to our approach is a new primitive called \"Insertable Proof of Sequential Work\" (InPoSW). Traditional PoSW ensures that a server performs computational tasks that cannot be parallelized and require a minimum execution time, effectively timestamping the input data. InPoSW additionally allows the prover to \"insert\" new data into an ongoing InPoSW instance. This primitive can be of independent interest for other timestamp applications. Compared to naively adopting prior PoSW schemes for In-PoSW, our construction achieves >22\u00d7 storage reduction on the server side and >17900\u00d7 communication cost reduction for each verification.",

    "abstract": "Asynchronous Verifiable Information Dispersal (AVID) allows a dealer to disperse a message $M$ across a collection of server replicas consistently and efficiently, such that any future client can reliably retrieve the message $M$ if some servers fail.\r\nSince AVID was introduced by Cachin and Tessaro in 2005, several works improved the asymptotic communication complexity of AVID protocols.\r\nHowever, recent gains in communication complexity have come at the expense of sub-optimal storage, which is the dominant cost in long-term archiving.\r\nMoreover, recent works do not provide a mechanism to detect errors until the retrieval stage, which may result in completely wasted long-term storage if the dealer is malicious.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we contribute a new AVID construction that achieves optimal storage and guaranteed output delivery, without sacrificing on communication complexity during dispersal or retrieval.\r\nFirst, we introduce a technique that bootstraps from dispersal of a message with sub-optimal storage to one with optimal storage.\r\nSecond, we define and construct an AVID protocol that is robust, meaning that all server replicas are guaranteed at dispersal time that their fragments will contribute toward retrieval of a valid message.\r\nThird, we add the new possibility that some server replicas may lose their fragment in between dispersal and retrieval (as is likely in the long-term archiving scenario).\r\nThis allows us to rely on fewer available replicas for retrieval than are required for dispersal.",

    "abstract": "A functional commitment allows a user to commit to an input $\\mathbf{x}$ and later, open the commitment to an arbitrary function $\\mathbf{y} = f(\\mathbf{x})$. The size of the commitment and the opening should be sublinear in $|\\mathbf{x}|$ and $|f|$.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we give the first pairing-based functional commitment for arbitrary circuits where the size of the commitment and the size of the opening consist of a constant number of group elements. Security relies on the standard bilateral $k$-$\\mathsf{Lin}$ assumption. This is the first scheme with this level of succinctness from falsifiable bilinear map assumptions (previous approaches required SNARKs for $\\mathsf{NP}$). This is also the first functional commitment scheme for general circuits with $\\mathsf{poly}(\\lambda)$-size commitments and openings from any assumption that makes fully black-box use of cryptographic primitives and algorithms. As an immediate consequence, we also obtain a succinct non-interactive argument for arithmetic circuits (i.e., a SNARG for $\\mathsf{P}/\\mathsf{poly}$) with a universal setup and where the proofs consist of a constant number of group elements. In particular, the CRS in our SNARG only depends on the size of the arithmetic circuit $|C|$ rather than the circuit $C$ itself; the same CRS can be used to verify computations with respect to different circuits. Our construction relies on a new notion of projective chainable commitments which may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT's) are a type of large language machine learning model that are unusually adept at producing novel, and coherent, natural language. Notably, these technologies have also been extended to computer programming languages with great success. However, GPT model outputs in general are stochastic and not always correct. For programming languages, the exact specification of the computer code, syntactically and algorithmically, is strictly required in order to ensure the security of computing systems and applications. Therefore, using GPT models to generate computer code poses an important security risk -- while at the same time allowing for potential innovation in how computer code is generated. In this study the ability of GPT models to generate novel and correct versions, and notably very insecure versions, of implementations of the cryptographic hash function SHA-1 is examined. The GPT models Llama-2-70b-chat-hf, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1, and zephyr-7b-alpha are used. The GPT models are prompted to re-write each function using a modified version of the localGPT framework and langchain to provide word embedding context of the full source code and header files to the model, resulting in over $130,000$ function re-write GPT output text blocks (that are potentially correct source code), approximately $40,000$ of which were able to be parsed as C code and subsequently compiled. The generated code is analyzed for being compilable, correctness of the algorithm, memory leaks, compiler optimization stability, and character distance to the reference implementation. Remarkably, several generated function variants have a high implementation security risk of being correct for some test vectors, but incorrect for other test vectors. Additionally, many function implementations were not correct to the reference algorithm of SHA-1, but produced hashes that have some of the basic characteristics of hash functions. Many of the function re-writes contained serious flaws such as memory leaks, integer overflows, out of bounds accesses, use of uninitialised values, and compiler optimization instability. Compiler optimization settings and SHA-256 hash checksums of the compiled binaries are used to cluster implementations that are equivalent but may not have identical syntax - using this clustering over $100,000$ distinct, novel, and correct versions of the SHA-1 codebase were generated where each component C function of the reference implementation is different from the original code.",

    "abstract": "In white-box cryptography, early protection techniques have fallen to the automated Differential Computation Analysis attack (DCA), leading to new countermeasures and attacks. A standard side-channel countermeasure, Ishai-Sahai-Wagner's masking scheme (ISW, CRYPTO 2003) prevents Differential Computation Analysis but was shown to be vulnerable in the white-box context to the Linear Decoding Analysis attack (LDA). However, recent quadratic and cubic masking schemes by Biryukov-Udovenko (ASIACRYPT 2018) and Seker-Eisenbarth-Liskiewicz (CHES 2021) prevent LDA and force to use its higher-degree generalizations with much higher complexity.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we study the relationship between the security of these and related schemes to the Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem and propose a new automated attack by applying an LPN-solving algorithm to white-box implementations. The attack effectively exploits strong linear approximations of the masking scheme and thus can be seen as a combination of the DCA and LDA techniques. Different from previous attacks, the complexity of this algorithm depends on the approximation error, henceforth allowing new practical attacks on masking schemes that previously resisted automated analysis. We demonstrate it theoretically and experimentally, exposing multiple cases where the LPN-based method significantly outperforms LDA and DCA methods, including their higher-order variants.\r\n\r\nThis work applies the LPN problem beyond its usual post-quantum cryptography boundary, strengthening its interest in the cryptographic community, while expanding the range of automated attacks by presenting a new direction for breaking masking schemes in the white-box model.",

    "abstract": "This work proposes a new white-box attack technique called filtering, which can be combined with any other trace-based attack method. The idea is to filter the traces based on the value of an intermediate variable in the implementation, aiming to fix a share of a sensitive value and degrade the security of an involved masking scheme.\r\n\r\nCoupled with LDA (filtered LDA, FLDA), it leads to an attack defeating the state-of-the-art SEL masking scheme (CHES 2021) of arbitrary degree and number of linear shares with quartic complexity in the window size. In comparison, the current best attacks have exponential complexities in the degree (higher degree decoding analysis, HDDA), in the number of linear shares (higher-order differential computation analysis, HODCA), or the window size (white-box learning parity with noise, WBLPN).\r\n\r\nThe attack exploits the key idea of the SEL scheme - an efficient parallel combination of the nonlinear and linear masking schemes. We conclude that a proper composition of masking schemes is essential for security.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we propose several optimizations for linear algebraic attacks: redundant node removal (RNR), optimized parity check matrix usage, and chosen-plaintext filtering (CPF), significantly improving the performance of security evaluation of white-box implementations.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on algebraic attacks on the $\\mathsf{Anemoi}$ family of arithmetization-oriented permutations [Crypto '23]. We consider a slight variation of the naive modeling of the $\\mathsf{CICO}$ problem associated to the primitive, for which we can very easily obtain a Gr\u00f6bner basis and prove the degree of the associated ideal. For inputs in $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^2$ when $q$ is an odd prime, we recover the same degree as conjectured for alternative polynomial systems used in other recent works [eprint/2024/250,eprint/2024/347]. Our approach can also be adapted to other settings which have not been studied there, i.e., even characteristic fields and inputs in $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2\\ell}$ for $\\ell > 1$. Finally, we analyze the construction of the multiplication matrices associated to our Gr\u00f6bner basis, showing that it can be achieved in a more efficient way than in the generic case.",

    "abstract": "Private information retrieval (PIR) is a fundamental cryptographic primitive that allows a user to fetch a database entry without revealing to the server which database entry it learns. PIR becomes non-trivial if the server communication is less than the database size. We show that building (even) very weak forms of single-server PIR protocols, without pre-processing, requires the number of public-key operations to scale linearly in the database size. This holds irrespective of the number of symmetric-key operations performed by the parties.\r\nWe then use this bound to examine the related problem of communication efficient oblivious transfer (OT) extension.\r\nOblivious transfer is a crucial building block in secure multi-party computation (MPC). In most MPC protocols, OT invocations are the main bottleneck in terms of computation and communication. OT extension techniques allow one to minimize the number of public-key operations in MPC protocols. One drawback of all existing OT extension protocols is their communication overhead. In particular, the sender\u2019s communication is roughly double what is information-theoretically optimal.\r\nWe show that OT extension with close to optimal sender communication is impossible, illustrating that the communication overhead is inherent. Our techniques go much further; we can show many lower bounds on communication-efficient MPC. E.g., we prove that to build high-rate string OT from generic groups, the sender needs to do linearly many group operations",

    "abstract": "This paper's purpose is to give a new method of analyzing Beale Cipher 1 and Cipher 3 and to show that there is no key which will decipher them into sentences.\r\n     Previous research has largely used statistical methods to\r\neither decipher them or prove they have no solution. Some\r\nof these methods show that there is a high probability, but not certainty that they are unsolvable. Both ciphers remain unsolved.\r\n     The methods used in this paper are not statistical ones\r\nbased on thousands of samples. The evidence given here shows there is a high correlation between locations of certain numbers in the ciphers with locations in the written text that was given with these ciphers in the 1885 pamphlet called \"The Beale Papers\".\r\n     Evidence is correlated with a long monotonically increasing Gillogly String in Cipher 1, when translated with the Declaration of Independence given in the pamphlet.\r\n     The Beale Papers' writer was anonymous, and words in the three written letters in the 1885 pamphlet are compared with locations of numbers in the ciphers to show who the writer was.\r\n     Emphasis is on numbers which are controllable by the encipherer. Letter location sums are used when they are the most plausible ones found.\r\n     Evidence supports the statement that Cipher 1 and Cipher 3 are unintelligible. It also supports the statement that they were designed to have no intelligible sentences because they were part of a complex game made by the anonymous writer of The Beale Papers.",

    "abstract": "The Asynchronous Common Subset (ACS) problem is a fundamental problem in distributed computing.  Very recently, Das et al. (2024) developed a new ACS protocol with several desirable properties: (i) it provides optimal resilience, tolerating up to $t < n/3$ corrupt parties out of $n$ parties in total, (ii) it does not rely on a trusted set up, (iii) it utilizes only \"lighweight\" cryptography, which can be instantiated  using just a hash function, and (iv) it has expected round complexity $O(1)$ and expected communication complexity $O(\\kappa n^3)$, where $\\kappa$ is the output-length of the hash function.  The purpose of this paper is to give a detailed, self-contained exposition and analysis of this protocol from the point of view of modern theoretcal cryptography, fleshing out a number of details of the definitions and proofs, providing a complete security analysis based on concrete security assumptions on the hash function (i.e., without relying on random oracles), and developing all of the underlying theory in the universal composability framework.",

    "abstract": "The discourse herein pertains to a directional encryption cryptosystem predicated upon logarithmic signatures interconnected via a system of linear equations (we call it LINE). A logarithmic signature serves as a foundational cryptographic primitive within the algorithm, characterized by distinct cryptographic attributes including nonlinearity, noncommutativity, unidirectionality, and factorizability by key. The confidentiality of the cryptosystem is contingent upon the presence of an incomplete system of equations and the substantial ambiguity inherent in the matrix transformations integral to the algorithm. Classical cryptanalysis endeavors are constrained by the potency of the secret matrix transformation and the indeterminacy surrounding solutions to the system of linear equations featuring logarithmic signatures. Such cryptanalysis methodologies, being exhaustive in nature, invariably exhibit exponential complexity. The absence of inherent group computations within the algorithm, and by extension, the inability to exploit group properties associated with the periodicity of group elements, serves to mitigate quantum cryptanalysis to Grover's search algorithm. LINE is predicated upon an incomplete system of linear equations embodies the security levels ranging from 1 to 5, as stipulated by the NIST, and thus presents a promising candidate for the construction of post-quantum cryptosystems.",

    "abstract": "We present a framework for privacy-preserving streaming algorithms which combine the memory-efficiency of streaming algorithms with strong privacy guarantees. These algorithms enable some number of servers to compute aggregate statistics efficiently on large quantities of user data without learning the user's inputs. While there exists limited prior work that fits within our model, our work is the first to formally define a general framework, interpret existing methods within this general framework, and develop new tools broadly applicable to this model. To highlight our model, we designed and implemented a new privacy-preserving streaming algorithm to compute heavy hitters, which are the most frequent elements in a data stream.  We provide a performance comparison between our system and Poplar, the only other private statistics algorithm which supports heavy hitters. We benchmarked ours and Poplar's systems and provided direct performance comparisons within the same hardware platform. Of note, Poplar requires linear space compared to our poly-logarithmic space, meaning our system is the first to compute heavy hitters within the privacy-preserving streaming model. A small memory footprint allows our algorithm (among other benefits) to run efficiently on a very large input sizes without running out of memory or crashing.",

    "abstract": "RSA is an incredibly successful and useful asymmetric encryption algorithm. One of the types of implementation flaws in RSA is low entropy of the key generation, specifically the prime number creation stage. This can occur due to flawed usage of random prime number generator libraries, or on computers where there is a lack of a source of external entropy. These implementation flaws result in some RSA keys sharing prime factors, which means that the full factorization of the public modulus can be recovered incredibly efficiently by performing a computation GCD between the two public key moduli that share the prime factor. However, since one does not know which of the composite moduli share a prime factor a-priori, to determine if any such shared prime factors exist, an all-to-all GCD attack (also known as a batch GCD attack, or a bulk GCD attack) can be performed on the available public keys so as to recover any shared prime factors. This study describes a novel all-to-all batch GCD algorithm, which will be referred to as the binary tree batch GCD algorithm, that is more efficient than the current best batch GCD algorithm (the remainder tree batch GCD algorithm). A comparison against the best existing batch GCD method (which is a product tree followed by a remainder tree computation) is given using a dataset of random RSA moduli that are constructed such that some of the moduli share prime factors. This proposed binary tree batch GCD algorithm has better runtime than the existing remainder tree batch GCD algorithm, although asymptotically it has nearly identical scaling and its complexity is dependent on how many shared prime factors exist in the set of RSA keys. In practice, the implementation of the proposed binary tree batch GCD algorithm has a roughly 6x speedup compared to the standard remainder tree batch GCD approach.",

    "abstract": "Multiple works have designed or used maliciously secure honest majority MPC protocols over $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$ using replicated secret sharing (e.g. Koti et al. USENIX'21). A recent trend in the design of such MPC protocols is to first execute a semi-honest protocol, and then use a check that verifies the correctness of the computation requiring only sublinear amount of communication in terms of the circuit size. The so-called Galois ring extensions are needed in order to execute such checks over $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$, but these rings incur incredibly high computation overheads, which completely undermine any potential benefits the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$ had to begin with.\r\n\r\nIn this work we revisit the task of designing sublinear distributed product checks on replicated secret-shared data over $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$ among three parties with an honest majority. We present a novel technique for verifying the correctness of a set of multiplication (in fact, inner product) triples, involving a sublinear cost in terms of the number of multiplications. Most importantly, unlike previous works, our tools do not rely on Galois ring extensions, which are computationally expensive, and only require computation over rings of the form $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^\\ell}$. In terms of communication, our checks are $3\\sim 5\\times$ lighter than existing checks using ring extensions, which is already quite remarkable. However, our most noticeable improvement is in terms of computation: our checks are $17.7\\sim 44.2\\times$ better than previous approaches, for many parameter regimes of interest. Our experimental results show that checking a 10 million gate circuit with the 3PC protocol from Boyle et al. (CCS'19) takes about two minutes, while our approach takes only 2.82 seconds. \r\n\r\nFinally, our techniques are not restricted to the three-party case, and we generalize them to replicated secret-sharing with an arbitrary number of parties $n$. Even though the share size in this scheme grows exponentially with $n$, prior works have used it for $n=4$ or $n=5$ --- or even general $n$ for feasibility results --- and our distributed checks also represent improvements in these contexts.",

    "abstract": "Unpredictable functions (UPFs) play essential roles in classical cryptography, including message authentication codes (MACs) and digital signatures. In this paper, we introduce a quantum analog of UPFs, which we call unpredictable state generators (UPSGs). UPSGs are implied by pseudorandom function-like states generators (PRFSs), which are a quantum analog of pseudorandom functions (PRFs), and therefore UPSGs could exist even if one-way functions do not exist, similar to other recently introduced primitives like pseudorandom state generators (PRSGs), one-way state generators (OWSGs), and EFIs. In classical cryptography, UPFs are equivalent to PRFs, but in the quantum case, the equivalence is not clear, and UPSGs could be weaker than PRFSs. Despite this, we demonstrate that all known applications of PRFSs are also achievable with UPSGs.  They include IND-CPA-secure secret-key encryption and EUF-CMA-secure MACs with unclonable tags.  Our findings suggest that, for many applications,  quantum unpredictability, rather than quantum pseudorandomness, is sufficient.",

    "abstract": "Signal recently deployed a new handshake protocol named PQXDH to protect against \"harvest-now-decrypt-later\" attacks of a future quantum computer. To this end, PQXDH adds a post-quantum KEM to the Diffie-Hellman combinations of the prior X3DH handshake.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we give a reductionist security analysis of Signal's PQXDH handshake in a game-based security model that captures the targeted \"maximum-exposure\" security against both classical and quantum adversaries, allowing fine-grained compromise of user's long-term, semi-static, and ephemeral key material. We augment prior such models to capture not only the added KEM component but also the signing of public keys, which prior analyses did not capture but which adds an additional flavor of post-quantum security in PQXDH. We then establish fully parameterized, concrete security bounds for the classical and post-quantum session key security of PQXDH, and discuss how design choices in PQXDH make a KEM binding property necessary and how a lack of domain separation reduces the achievable security.\r\n\r\nOur discussion of KEM binding and domain separation complements the concurrent tool-based analysis of PQXDH by Bhargavan, Jacomme, Kiefer, and Schmidt (USENIX Security 2024), which pointed out a potential re-encapsulation attack if the KEM shared secret does not bind the public key. In contrast to the tool-based analysis, we analyze all protocol modes of PQXDH and its \"maximum-exposure\" security. We further show that both Kyber (used in PQXDH) and the NIST standard ML-KEM (expected to replace Kyber) satisfy a novel binding notion we introduce and rely on for our PQXDH analysis, which may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, cloud vendors have started to supply paid services for data analysis by providing interfaces of their well-trained neural network models. However, customers lack tools to verify whether outcomes supplied by cloud vendors are correct inferences from particular models, in the face of lazy or malicious vendors. The cryptographic primitive called zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) addresses this problem. It enables the outcomes to be verifiable without leaking information about the models. Unfortunately, existing ZKP schemes for neural networks have high computational overheads, especially for the non-linear layers in neural networks.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose an efficient and extensible ZKP framework for neural networks. Our work improves the performance of the proofs for non-linear layers. Compared to previous works relying on the technology of bit decomposition, we convert complex non-linear relations into range and exponent relations, which significantly reduces the number of constraints required to prove non-linear layers. Moreover, we adopt a modular design to make our framework compatible with more neural networks. Specifically, we propose two enhanced range and lookup proofs as basic blocks. They are efficient in proving the satisfaction of range and exponent relations. Then, we constrain the correct calculation of primitive non-linear operations using a small number of range and exponent relations. Finally, we build our ZKP framework from the primitive operations to the entire neural networks, offering the flexibility for expansion to various neural networks. \r\n\r\nWe implement our ZKPs for convolutional and transformer neural networks. The evaluation results show that our work achieves over $168.6\\times$ (up to $477.2\\times$) speedup for separated non-linear layers and $41.4\\times$ speedup for the entire ResNet-101 convolutional neural network, when compared with the state-of-the-art work, Mystique. In addition, our work can prove GPT-2, a transformer neural network with $117$ million parameters, in $287.1$ seconds, achieving $35.7\\times$ speedup over ZKML, which is a state-of-the-art work supporting transformer neural networks.",

    "abstract": "We study selfish mining attacks in longest-chain blockchains like Bitcoin, but where the proof of work is replaced with efficient proof systems -- like proofs of stake or proofs of space -- and consider the problem of computing an optimal selfish mining attack which maximizes expected relative revenue of the adversary, thus minimizing the chain quality. To this end, we propose a novel selfish mining attack that aims to maximize this objective and formally model the attack as a Markov decision process (MDP). We then present a formal analysis procedure which computes an $\\epsilon$-tight lower bound on the optimal expected relative revenue in the MDP and a strategy that achieves this $\\epsilon$-tight lower bound, where $\\epsilon>0$ may be any specified precision. Our analysis is fully automated and provides formal guarantees on the correctness. We evaluate our selfish mining attack and observe that it achieves superior expected relative revenue compared to two considered baselines.\r\n\r\nIn concurrent work [Sarenche FC'24] does an automated analysis on selfish mining in predictable longest-chain blockchains based on efficient proof systems. Predictable means the randomness for the challenges is fixed for many blocks (as used e.g., in Ouroboros), while \r\nwe consider unpredictable (Bitcoin-like) chains where the challenge is derived from the previous block.",

    "abstract": "In this work we tackle privacy concerns in biometric verification systems that typically require server-side processing of sensitive data (e.g., fingerprints and Iris Codes). Concretely, we design a solution that allows us to query whether a given Iris Code is similar to one contained in a given database, while all queries and datasets are being protected using secure multiparty computation (MPC). Addressing the substantial performance demands of operational systems like World ID and aid distributions by the Red Cross, we propose new protocols to improve performance by more than three orders of magnitude compared to the recent state-of-the-art system Janus (S&P 24). Our final protocol can achieve a throughput of over 690 thousand Iris Code comparisons per second on a single CPU core, while protecting the privacy of both the query and database Iris Codes. Furthermore, using Nvidia NCCL we implement the whole protocol on GPUs while letting GPUs directly access the network interface. Thus we are able to avoid the costly data transfer between GPUs and CPUs, allowing us to achieve a throughput of 4.29 billion Iris Code comparisons per second in a 3-party MPC setting, where each party has access to 8 H100 GPUs. This GPU implementation achieves the performance requirements set by the Worldcoin foundation and will thus be used in their deployed World ID infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "We extend the Linicrypt framework for characterizing hash function security as proposed by McQuoid, Swope, and Rosulek (TCC 2018) to support constructions in the ideal cipher model.\r\nIn this setting, we give a characterization of collision- and second-preimage-resistance in terms of a linear-algebraic condition on Linicrypt programs, and present an efficient algorithm for determining whether a program satisfies the condition. As an application, we consider the case of the block cipherbased hash functions proposed by Preneel, Govaerts, and Vandewall (Crypto 1993), and show that the semantic analysis of PGV given by Black et. al. (J. Crypto. 2010) can be captured as a special case of our characterization. In addition, We model hash functions constructed through the Merkle-Damg\u00e5rd transformation within the Linicrypt framework. Finally, we appy this model to an analysis of how various attacks on the underlying compression functions can compromise the collision resistance of the resulting hash function.",

    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a transformative technology that enables computations on encrypted data without requiring decryption, promising enhanced data privacy. However, its adoption has been limited due to significant performance overheads. Recent advances include the proposal of domain-specific, highly-parallel hardware accelerators designed to overcome these limitations.\r\nThis paper introduces PICA, a comprehensive compiler framework designed to simplify the programming of these specialized FHE accelerators and integration with existing FHE libraries. PICA leverages a novel polynomial Instruction Set Architecture (p-ISA), which abstracts polynomial rings and their arithmetic operations, serving as a fundamental data type for the creation of compact, efficient code embracing high-level operations on polynomial rings, referred to as kernels, e.g., encompassing FHE primitives like arithmetic and ciphertext management. We detail a kernel generation framework that translates high-level FHE operations into pseudo-code using p-ISA, and a subsequent tracing framework that incorporates p-ISA functionalities and kernels into established FHE libraries. Additionally, we introduce a mapper to coordinate multiple FHE kernels for optimal application performance on targeted hardware accelerators. Our evaluations demonstrate PICA's efficacy in creation of compact and efficient code, when compared with an x64 architecture. Particularly in managing complex FHE operations such as relinearization, where we observe a 25.24x instruction count reduction even when a large batch size (8192) is taken into account.",

    "abstract": "Fault Injection (FI) attacks, which involve intentionally introducing faults into a system to cause it to behave in an unintended manner, are widely recognized and pose a significant threat to the security of cryptographic primitives implemented in hardware, making fault tolerance an increasingly critical concern. However, protecting cryptographic hardware primitives securely and efficiently, even with well-established and documented methods such as redundant computation, can be a time-consuming, error-prone, and expertise-demanding task. \r\nIn this research, we present a comprehensive and fully-automated software solution for the Automated Generation of Fault-Resistant Circuits (AGEFA). Our application employs a generic and extensively researched methodology for the secure integration of countermeasures based on Error-Correcting Codes (ECCs) into cryptographic hardware circuits. Our software tool allows designers without hardware security expertise to develop fault-tolerant hardware circuits with pre-defined correction capabilities under a comprehensive fault adversary model. Moreover, our tool applies to masked designs without violating the masking security requirements, in particular to designs generated by the tool AGEMA. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various block ciphers and demonstrate its ability to produce fault-tolerant circuits. Additionally, we assess the security of examples generated by AGEFA against Side-Channel Analysis (SCA) and FI using state-of-the-art leakage and fault evaluation tools.",

    "abstract": "FALCON is candidate for standardization of the new Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) primitives by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). However, it remains a challenge to define efficient countermeasures against side-channel attacks (SCA) for this algorithm. FALCON is a lattice-based signature that relies on rational numbers which is unusual in the cryptography field. While recent work proposed a solution to mask the addition and the multiplication, some roadblocks remain, most noticeably how to protect the floor function. We propose in this work to complete the existing first trials of hardening FALCON against SCA. We perform the mathematical proofs of our methods as well as formal security proof in the probing model using the Non-Interference concepts.",

    "abstract": "This work shows how FALCON can achieve the Beyond UnForgeability Features (BUFF) introduced by Cremers et al. (S&P'21) more efficiently than by applying the generic BUFF transform. Specifically, we show that applying a transform of Pornin and Stern (ACNS'05), dubbed PS-3 transform, already suffices for FALCON to achieve BUFF security. For FALCON, this merely means to include the public key in the hashing step in signature generation and verification, instead of hashing only the nonce and the message; the other signature computation steps and the signature output remain untouched. In comparison to the BUFF transform, which appends a hash value to the final signature, the PS-3 transform therefore achieves shorter signature sizes, without incurring additional computations.",

    "abstract": "Non-transferability (NT) is a security notion which ensures that credentials are only used by their intended owners. Despite its importance, it has not been formally treated in the context of anonymous tokens (AT) which are lightweight anonymous credentials. In this work, we consider a client who \"buys\" access tokens which are forbidden to be transferred although anonymously redeemed. We extensively study the trade-offs between privacy (obtained through anonymity) and security in AT through the notion of non-transferability. We formalise new security notions, design a suite of protocols with various flavors of NT, prove their security, and implement the protocols to assess their efficiency. Finally, we study the existing anonymous credentials which offer NT, and show that they cannot automatically be used as AT without security and complexity implications.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computers can efficiently model and solve several challenging problems for classical computers, raising concerns about potential security reductions in cryptography. NIST is already considering potential quantum attacks in the development of post-quantum cryptography by estimating the quantum resources required for such quantum attacks. In this paper, we present quantum circuits for the NV sieve algorithm to solve the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP), which serves as the security foundation for lattice-based cryptography, achieving a quantum speedup of the square root. Although there has been extensive research on the application of quantum algorithms for lattice-based problems at the theoretical level, specific quantum circuit implementations for them have not been presented yet.\r\n\r\nNotably, this work demonstrates that the required quantum complexity for the SVP in the lattice of rank 70 and dimension 70 is $2^{43}$ (a product of the total gate count and the total depth) with our optimized quantum implementation of the NV sieve algorithm.\r\n\r\nThis complexity is significantly lower than the NIST post-quantum security standard, where level 1 is $2^{157}$, corresponding to the complexity of Grover's key search for AES-128.",

Recently many lattice challenge records have been cracked by using the Pnj-BKZ algorithm which is the default lattice reduction algorithm used in G6K, such as the TU Darmstadt LWE and SVP Challenges. However, the previous estimations of the Pnj-BKZ algorithm are simulator algorithms rather than theoretical upper bound analyses.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a generalization of the Learning With Rounding (LWR) problem, initially introduced by Banerjee, Peikert, and Rosen, by applying the perspective of vector quantization. In LWR, noise is induced by  scalar quantization. By considering a new variant  termed Learning With Quantization (LWQ), we explore large-dimensional fast-decodable lattices with superior quantization properties, aiming to enhance the compression performance over scalar quantization. We identify polar lattices as exemplary structures, effectively transforming LWQ into a problem akin to Learning With Errors (LWE), whose distribution of quantization error is statistically close to discrete Gaussian. We present two applications of LWQ:  Lily, a smaller ciphertext public key encryption (PKE) scheme, and quancryption, a privacy-preserving secret-key encryption scheme. Lily achieves smaller ciphertext sizes without sacrificing security, while quancryption achieves a source-ciphertext ratio larger than $1$.",

    "abstract": "The advent of quantum computing technology will compromise many of the current cryptographic algorithms, especially public-key cryptography, which is widely used to protect digital information. Most algorithms on which we depend are used worldwide in components of many different communications, processing, and storage systems. Once access to practical quantum computers becomes available, all public-key algorithms and associated protocols will be vulnerable to criminals, competitors, and other adversaries. It is critical to begin planning for the replacement of hardware, software, and services that use public-key algorithms now so that information is protected from future attacks.\u201d [1]. \r\nFor this purpose, we have developed a new algorithm that contributes to deal with the aforementioned problem. Instead to use a classical scheme of encoding / decoding methods (keys, prime numbers, etc.), our algorithm is rather based on a combination of functions. Because the cardinality of the set of functions is infinite, it would be impossible for a third party (e.g. a hacker) to decode the secret information transmitted by the sender (Bob) to the receiver (Alice).",

    "abstract": "Unclonable cryptography utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to addresses cryptographic tasks that are impossible classically. We introduce a novel unclonable primitive in the context of secret sharing, called unclonable secret sharing (USS). In a USS scheme, there are $n$ shareholders, each holding a share of a classical secret represented as a quantum state. They can recover the secret once all parties (or at least $t$ parties) come together with their shares. Importantly, it should be infeasible to copy their own shares and send the copies to two non-communicating parties, enabling both of them to recover the secret. \r\n\r\nOur work initiates a formal investigation into the realm of unclonable secret sharing, shedding light on its implications, constructions, and inherent limitations.\r\n** Connections: We explore the connections between USS and other quantum cryptographic primitives such as unclonable encryption and position verification, showing the difficulties to achieve USS in different scenarios. \r\n         \r\n       **Limited Entanglement: In the case where the adversarial shareholders do not share any entanglement or limited entanglement, we demonstrate information-theoretic constructions for USS. \r\n\r\n       **Large Entanglement: If we allow the adversarial shareholders to have unbounded entanglement resources (and unbounded computation), we prove that unclonable secret sharing is impossible. On the other hand, in the quantum random oracle model where the adversary can only make a bounded polynomial number of queries, we show a construction secure even with unbounded entanglement.  \r\n         \r\n         Furthermore, even when these adversaries possess only a polynomial amount of entanglement resources, we establish that any unclonable secret sharing scheme with a reconstruction function implementable using Cliffords and logarithmically many T-gates is also unattainable.",

    "abstract": "We present distributed key generation and decryption protocols for an additively homomorphic cryptosystem based on class groups, improving on a similar system proposed by Braun, Damg\u00e5rd, and Orlandi at CRYPTO '23. Our key generation is similarly constant round but achieves lower communication complexity than the previous work. This improvement is in part the result of relaxing the reconstruction property required of the underlying integer verifiable secret sharing scheme. This eliminates the reliance on potentially costly proofs of knowledge in unknown order groups. We present a new method to batch zero-knowledge proofs in unknown order groups which strengthens these improvements. We also present a protocol which is proven secure against adaptive adversaries in the single inconsistent player (SIP) model. Our protocols are secure in the universal composability (UC) framework and provide guaranteed output delivery. We demonstrate the relative efficiency of our techniques by presenting the running times and communication costs associated with our implementation of the statically secure protocol and provide a direct comparison with alternate state of the art constructions.",

    "abstract": "Provable privacy typically requires involved analysis and is often associated with unacceptable accuracy loss. While many empirical verification or approximation methods, such as Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) and Differential Privacy Auditing (DPA), have been proposed, these do not offer rigorous privacy guarantees. In this paper, we apply recently-proposed Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Privacy to give formal, mechanized, simulation-based proofs for a range of practical, black-box algorithms: K-Means, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Random Forests. To provide these proofs, we present a new simulation algorithm that efficiently determines anisotropic noise perturbation required for any given level of privacy. We provide a proof of correctness for this algorithm and demonstrate that anisotropic noise has substantive benefits over isotropic noise.\r\n\r\nStable algorithms are easier to privatize, and we demonstrate privacy amplification resulting from introducing regularization in these algorithms; meaningful privacy guarantees are obtained with small losses in accuracy. We propose new techniques in order to reduce instability in algorithmic output and convert intractable geometric stability verification into efficient deterministic stability verification. Thorough experiments are included, and we validate our provable adversarial inference hardness against state-of-the-art empirical attacks.",

    "abstract": "Private Information Retrieval (PIR) permits clients to query entries from a public database hosted on untrusted servers in a privacy-preserving manner. Traditional PIR model suffers from high computation and/or bandwidth cost due to entire database processing for privacy. Recently, Online-Offline PIR (OO-PIR) has been suggested to improve the practicality of PIR, where query-independent materials are precomputed beforehand to accelerate online access. While state-of-the-art OO-PIR schemes (e.g., S&P\u201924, CRYPTO\u201923) successfully reduce the online processing overhead to sublinear, they still impose sustainable bandwidth and storage burdens on the client, especially when operating on large databases.\r\nIn this paper, we propose Pirex, a new OO-PIR scheme with eminent client performance while maintaining the sublinear server processing efficiency. Specifically, Pirex offers clients with sublinear processing, minimal inbound bandwidth, and low storage requirements. Our Pirex design is fairly simple yet efficient, where the majority of operations are naturally low-cost and streamlined (e.g., XOR, PRF, modular arithmetic).\r\nWe have fully implemented Pirex and evaluated its real-world performance using commodity hardware. Our experimental results demonstrated that Pirex outperforms existing OO-PIR schemes by at least two orders of magnitude. Concretely, with a 1 TB database, Pirex only takes 0.8s to query a 256-KB entry, compared with 30-220s by the state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "In 2017, Petzoldt, Szepieniec, and Mohamed proposed a blind signature scheme, based on multivariate cryptography. This construction has been expanded on by several other works. This short paper shows that their construction is susceptible to an efficient polynomial-time attack. The problem is that the authors implicitly assumed that for a random multivariate quadratic map $\\mathcal{R}:\\mathbb{F}_q^m \\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_q^m$ and a collision-resistant hash function $H: \\{0,1\\}^* \\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_q^m$, the function $\\mathsf{Com}(m;\\mathbf{r}) := H(m) - \\mathcal{R}(\\mathbf{r})$ is a binding commitment, which is not the case. There is a \"folklore\" algorithm that can be used to, given any pair of messages, efficiently produce a commitment that opens to both of them. We hope that by pointing out that multivariate quadratic maps are not binding, similar problems can be avoided in the future.",

    "abstract": "Simulation extractability is a strong security notion of zkSNARKs that guarantees that an attacker who produces a valid proof must know the corresponding witness, even if the attacker had prior access to proofs generated by other users. Notably, simulation extractability implies that proofs are non-malleable and is of fundamental importance for applications of zkSNARKs in distributed systems. In this work, we study sufficient and necessary conditions for constructing simulation-extractable universal zkSNARKs via the popular design approach based on compiling polynomial interactive oracle proofs (PIOP). Our main result is the first security proof that popular universal zkSNARKs, such as PLONK and Marlin, as deployed in the real world, are simulation-extractable. Our result fills a gap left from previous work (Faonio et al. TCC\u201923, and Kohlweiss et al. TCC\u201923) which could only prove the simulation extractability of the \u201ctextbook\u201d versions of these schemes and does not capture their optimized variants, with all the popular optimization tricks in place, that are eventually implemented and deployed in software libraries.",

    "abstract": "Our work aims to minimize interaction in secure computation due to the high cost and challenges associated with communication rounds, particularly in scenarios with many clients. In this work, we revisit the problem of secure aggregation in the single-server setting where a single evaluation server can securely aggregate client-held individual inputs. Our key contribution is the introduction of One-shot Private Aggregation ($\\mathsf{OPA}$) where clients speak only once (or even choose not to speak) per aggregation evaluation. Since each client communicates only once per aggregation, this simplifies managing dropouts and dynamic participation, contrasting with multi-round protocols and aligning with plaintext secure aggregation, where clients interact only once. \r\n\r\nWe construct $\\mathsf{OPA}$ based on LWR, LWE, class groups, DCR and demonstrate applications to privacy-preserving Federated Learning (FL) where clients {speak once}. This is a sharp departure from prior multi-round FL protocols whose study was initiated by Bonawitz et al. (CCS, 2017). Moreover, unlike the YOSO (You Only Speak Once) model for general secure computation, $\\mathsf{OPA}$ eliminates complex committee selection protocols to achieve adaptive security. Beyond asymptotic improvements, $\\mathsf{OPA}$ is practical, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions. We benchmark logistic regression classifiers for two datasets, while also building an MLP classifier to train on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets.\r\n\r\nWe build two flavors of $\\mathsf{OPA}$ (1) from (threshold) key homomorphic PRF and (2) from seed homomorphic PRG and secret sharing. \r\nThe threshold Key homomorphic PRF addresses shortcomings observed in previous works that relied on DDH and LWR in the work of Boneh et al. (CRYPTO, 2013), marking it as an independent contribution to our work. Moreover, we also present new threshold key homomorphic PRFs based on class groups or DCR or the LWR assumption.",

    "abstract": "The universal composability (UC) framework is a \u201cgold standard\u201d for security in cryptography. UC-secure protocols achieve strong security guarantees against powerful adaptive adversaries, and retain these guarantees when used as part of larger protocols. Zero knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zkSNARKs) are a popular cryptographic primitive that are often used within larger protocols deployed in dynamic environments, and so UC-security is a highly desirable, if not necessary, goal.\r\nIn this paper we prove that there exist zkSNARKs in the random oracle model (ROM) that unconditionally achieve UC-security. Here, \u201cunconditionally\u201d means that security holds against adversaries that make a bounded number of queries to the random oracle, but are otherwise computationally unbounded.\r\nPrior work studying UC-security for zkSNARKs obtains transformations that rely on computational assumptions and, in many cases, lose most of the succinctness property of the zkSNARK. Moreover, these transformations make the resulting zkSNARK more expensive and complicated.\r\nIn contrast, we prove that widely used zkSNARKs in the ROM are UC-secure without modifications. We prove that the Micali construction, which is the canonical construction of a zkSNARK, is UC-secure. Moreover, we prove that the BCS construction, which many zkSNARKs deployed in practice are based on, is UC-secure. Our results confirm the intuition that these natural zkSNARKs do not need to be augmented to achieve UC-security, and give confidence that their use in larger real-world systems is secure.",

    "abstract": "In FSE'16, Luykx et al. have proposed $\\textsf{LightMAC}$ that provably achieves a query length independent PRF security bound. To be precise, the construction achieves security roughly in the order of $O(q^2/2^n)$, when instantiated with two independently keyed $n$-bit block ciphers and $q$ is the total number of queries made by the adversary. Subsequently, in ASIACRYPT'17, Naito proposed a beyond-birthday-bound variant of the $\\textsf{LightMAC}$ construction, dubbed as $\\textsf{LightMAC_Plus}$, that is built on three independently keyed $n$-bit block ciphers and achieves $2n/3$-bits PRF security. Security analyses of these two constructions have been conducted in the single-user setting, where we assume that the adversary has the access to a single instance of the construction. In this paper, we investigate, for the first time, the security of the $\\textsf{LightMAC}$ and the $\\textsf{LightMAC_Plus}$ construction in the context of multi-user setting, where we assume that the adversary has access to more than one instances of the construction. In particular, we have shown that $\\textsf{LightMAC}$ remains secure  roughly up to  $2^{n/2}$ construction queries and $2^k$ ideal-cipher queries in the ideal-cipher model and $\\textsf{LightMAC_Plus}$ maintains security up to approximately $2^{2n/3}$ construction queries and $2^{2k/3}$ ideal-cipher queries in the ideal-cipher model, where $n$ denotes the block size and $k$ denotes the key size of the block cipher.",

    "abstract": "We propose Challenger a peer-to-peer blockchain-based middleware architecture for narrative games, and discuss its resilience to cheating attacks. Our architecture orchestrates nine services in a fully decentralized manner where nodes are not aware of the entire composition of the system nor its size.  All these components are orchestrated together to obtain (strong) resilience to cheaters.  \r\nThe main contribution of the paper is to provide, for the first time, an architecture for narrative games agnostic of a particular blockchain that brings together several distinct research areas, namely distributed ledgers, peer-to-peer networks, multi-player-online games and resilience to attacks.",

These include proving multi-user security from single-user security, the security of the cascade PRF, and the security of schemes sharing the same ideal primitive. We provide new variants of the definitions and show that they resolve these issues with composition. Extending these definitions to the asymmetric settings, we establish the security of the modular KEM/DEM and Fujisaki-Okamoto approaches to public key encryption in the full adaptive compromise setting. This allows instantiations which are more efficient and standard than prior constructions.",

    "abstract": "A relativized succinct argument in the random oracle model (ROM) is a succinct argument in the ROM that can prove/verify the correctness of computations that involve queries to the random oracle. We prove that relativized succinct arguments in the ROM do not exist. The impossibility holds even if the succinct argument is interactive, and even if soundness is computational (rather than statistical).\r\n\r\nThis impossibility puts on a formal footing the commonly-held belief that succinct arguments require non-relativizing techniques. Moreover, our results stand in sharp contrast with other oracle models, for which a recent line of work has constructed relativized succinct non-interactive arguments (SNARGs). Indeed, relativized SNARGs are a powerful primitive that, e.g., can be used to obtain constructions of IVC (incrementally-verifiable computation) and PCD (proof-carrying data) based on falsifiable cryptographic assumptions. Our results rule out this approach for IVC and PCD in the ROM.",

    "abstract": "In covert adversary model, the corrupted parties can behave in any possible  way like active adversaries, but any party that attempts to cheat is guaranteed to get caught by the honest parties with a minimum fixed probability.  That probability is called the deterrence factor of covert adversary model. Security-wise, covert adversary is stronger than passive adversary and weaker than active adversary. It is more realistic than passive adversary model. Protocols for covert adversaries are significantly more efficient than protocols for active adversaries. Covert adversary model is defined only for static corruption. Adaptive adversary model is more realistic than static adversaries. In this article, we define a new adversary model, the covert adaptive adversary model, by generalizing the definition of covert adversary model for the more realistic adaptive corruption. We prove security relations between the new covert adaptive adversary model with existing adversary models like passive adaptive adversary model, active adaptive\r\nadversary model and covert static adversary model. We prove the sequential composition theorem for the new adversary model which is necessary to allow modular design of protocols for this new adversary model.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the maximum size of a code with a given minimum distance is a major question in computer science and discrete mathematics. The most fruitful approach for finding asymptotic bounds on such codes is by using Delsarte's theory of association schemes. With this approach, Delsarte constructs a linear program such that its maximum value is an upper bound on the maximum size of a code with a given minimum distance. Bounding this value can be done by finding solutions to the corresponding dual linear program. Delsarte's theory is very general and goes way beyond binary codes. In this work, we provide universal bounds in the framework of association schemes that generalize the Elias-Bassalygo bound, which can be applied to any association scheme constructed from a distance function. These bounds are obtained by constructing new solutions to Delsarte's dual linear program. We instantiate these results and we recover known bounds for $q$-ary codes and for constant-weight binary codes. Our other contribution is to recover, for essentially any $Q$-polynomial scheme, MRRW-type solutions to Delsarte's dual linear program which are inspired by the Laplacian approach of Friedman and Tillich instead of using the Christoffel-Darboux formulas. We show in particular how the second linear programming bound can be interpreted in this framework.",

In particular, $F^{\\text{SoP}}_{B_2}$ and $F^{\\text{SoP}}_{B_3}$ enjoy graceful degradation as the number of queries with repeated nonces grows (when the underlying universal hash function satisfies a certain property called multi-xor-collision resistance). To do this, we develop a new tool, namely extended Mirror theory based on two independent permutations to a wide range of $\\xi_{\\max}$ including inequalities. We also present matching attacks on $F^{\\text{EDM}}_{B_4}$ and $F^{\\text{EDM}}_{B_5}$ using $O(2^{3n/4})$ MAC queries and $O(1)$ verification query without using repeated nonces.",

One of its main advantages lies in its ability to offer greater flexibil-\r\nity on parameters, such as the underlying ring dimension. In this work,\r\nwe present several lattice-based encryption schemes, which are IND-CPA\r\n(or OW-CPA) secure in the standard model based on the Module-NTRU\r\nand Module-LWE problems. Leveraging the Fujisaki-Okamoto transfor-\r\nmations, one can obtain IND-CCA secure key encapsulation schemes.\r\nOur first encryption scheme is based on the Module-NTRU assumption,\r\nwhich uses the determinant of the secret matrix over the underlying ring\r\nfor the decryption. Our second scheme is analogue to the Module-LWE\r\nencryption scheme, but uses only a matrix as the public key, based on a\r\nvectorial variant of the Module-NTRU problem. In the end, we conduct\r\ncomprehensive analysis of known attacks and propose concrete parame-\r\nters for the instantiations. In particular, our ciphertext size is about 614\r\n(resp. 1228) bytes for NIST Level 1 (resp.

    "abstract": "TLS oracles allow a TLS client to offer selective data provenance to an external (oracle) node such that the oracle node is ensured that the data is indeed coming from a pre-defined TLS server. Typically, the client/user supplies their credentials to the server and reveals selective data using zero-knowledge proofs to demonstrate certain server-offered information to oracles while ensuring the secrecy of the rest of the TLS transcript. Conceptually, this is a standard three-party secure computation between the TLS server, TLS client (prover), and the oracle (verifier) node; however, the key practical requirement for TLS oracles to ensure that data provenance process remains transparent to the TLS server. Recent TLS oracle protocols such as DECO enforce the communication pattern of server-client-verifier and utilize a novel three-party handshake process during TLS to ensure data integrity against potential tempering by the client. However, this approach introduces a significant performance penalty on the client/prover and the verifier. This raises the question of whether it is possible to reduce the overhead by putting the verifier (as a proxy) between the server and the client such that the correct TLS transcript is available to the verifier.\r\n\r\nThis work offers both positive and negative answers to this oracle proxy question: We first formalize the oracle proxy notion that allows the verifier to directly proxy client-server TLS communication, without entering a three-party handshake or interfering with the connection in any way. We then show that for common TLS-based higher-level protocols such as HTTPS, data integrity to the verifier proxy is ensured by the variable padding built into the HTTP protocol semantics. On the other hand, if a TLS-based protocol comes without variable padding, we demonstrate that data integrity cannot be guaranteed. In this context, we then study the case where the TLS response is pre-determined and cannot be tampered with during the connection. We propose the concept of context unforgeability and show allows overcoming the impossibility. We further show that ChaCha20-Poly1305 satisfies the concept while AES-GCM does not under the standard model.",

    "abstract": "We design a new MPC protocol for arithmetic circuits secure against erasure-free covert adaptive adversaries with deterrence 1/2. The new MPC protocol has the same asymptotic communication cost, the number of PKE operations and the number of exponentiation operations as the most efficient MPC protocol for arithmetic circuits secure against covert static adversaries. That means, the new MPC protocol improves security from covert static security to covert adaptive adversary almost for free. For MPC problems where the number of parties n is much larger than the number of multiplication gates M, the new MPC protocol asymptotically improves communication complexity over the most efficient MPC protocol for arithmetic circuits secure against erasure-free active adaptive adversaries.",

    "abstract": "Secret sharing allows a user to split a secret into many shares so that the secret can be recovered if, and only if, an authorized set of shares is collected. Although secret sharing typically does not require any computational hardness assumptions, its security does require that an adversary cannot collect an authorized set of shares. Over long periods of time where an adversary can benefit from multiple data breaches, this may become an unrealistic assumption.\r\n        We initiate the systematic study of secret sharing with certified deletion in order to achieve security even against an adversary that eventually collects an authorized set of shares. In secret sharing with certified deletion, a (classical) secret $s$ is split into quantum shares that can be destroyed in a manner verifiable by the dealer.\r\n        We put forth two natural definitions of security. No-signaling security roughly requires that if multiple non-communicating adversaries delete sufficiently many shares, then their combined view contains negligible information about $s$, even if the total set of corrupted parties forms an authorized set. Adaptive security requires privacy of $s$ against an adversary that can continuously and adaptively corrupt new shares and delete previously-corrupted shares, as long as the total set of corrupted shares minus deleted shares remains unauthorized.\r\n        Next, we show that these security definitions are achievable: we show how to construct (i) a secret sharing scheme with no-signaling certified deletion for any monotone access structure, and (ii) a threshold secret sharing scheme with adaptive certified deletion. Our first construction uses Bartusek and Khurana's (CRYPTO 2023) 2-out-of-2 secret sharing scheme with certified deletion as a building block, while our second construction is built from scratch and requires several new technical ideas. For example, we significantly generalize the ``XOR extractor'' of Agarwal, Bartusek, Khurana, and Kumar (EUROCRYPT 2023) in order to obtain better seedless extraction from certain quantum sources of entropy, and show how polynomial interpolation can double as a high-rate randomness extractor in our context of threshold sharing with certified deletion.",

    "abstract": "We put forth a new concept of mutability for batch arguments (BARGs), called mutable batch arguments. Our goal is to re-envision how we think about and use BARGs. Traditionally, a BARG proof $\\pi$ is an immutable encoding of $k$ $\\mathbf{NP}$ witness $\\omega_1, \\ldots, \\omega_{k}$. A mutable BARG system captures the notion of computations over BARGs, where each proof string $\\pi$ is treated as a mutable encoding of original witnesses. We also study strong privacy notions for mutable BARGs, with the goal of hiding all non-trivial information about witnesses from a mutated proof. Such mutable BARGs are a naturally good fit for many privacy sensitive applications.\r\n\r\nOur main contributions include introducing the concept of mutable BARGs, identifying non-trivial classes of feasible mutations, designing new constructions for mutable BARGs with varying capabilities satisfying mutation privacy from standard cryptographic assumptions, and enabling new applications to many advanced signatures (homomorphic/ redactable/ aggregate signatures). Our results improve state-of-the-art known for many signature systems. E.g., we provide the first multi-key homomorphic signature with succinct signatures from standard assumptions, and we provide the first truly compact redactable signature where pre/post-redaction signatures are of fixed size, and we provide the first locally verifiable multi-signer aggregate signature satisfying message privacy from standard assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Quantum information can be used to achieve novel cryptographic primitives that are impossible to achieve classically. A recent work by Ananth, Poremba, Vaikuntanathan (TCC 2023) focuses on equipping the dual-Regev encryption scheme, introduced by Gentry, Peikert, Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2008), with key revocation capabilities using quantum information. They further showed that the key-revocable dual-Regev scheme implies the existence of fully homomorphic encryption and pseudorandom functions, with both of them also equipped with key revocation capabilities. Unfortunately, they were only able to prove the security of their schemes based on new conjectures and left open the problem of basing the security of key revocable dual-Regev encryption on well-studied assumptions.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we resolve this open problem. Assuming polynomial hardness of learning with errors (over sub-exponential modulus), we show that key-revocable dual-Regev encryption is secure. As a consequence, for the first time, we achieve the following results: \r\n1. Key-revocable public-key encryption and key-revocable fully-homomorphic encryption satisfying classical revocation security and based on polynomial hardness of learning with errors. Prior works either did not achieve classical revocation or were based on sub-exponential hardness of learning with errors. \r\n2. Key-revocable pseudorandom functions satisfying classical revocation from the polynomial hardness of learning with errors. Prior works relied upon unproven conjectures.",

    "abstract": "The focus of this paper is to tackle the issue of memory access within sieving algorithms for lattice problems. We have conducted an in-depth analysis of an optimized BGJ sieve (Becker-Gama-Joux 2015), and our findings suggest that its inherent structure is significantly more memory-efficient compared to the asymptotically fastest BDGL sieve (Becker-Ducas-Gama-Laarhoven 2016). Specifically, it necessitates merely $2^{0.2075n + o(n)}$ streamed (non-random) main memory accesses for the execution of an $n$-dimensional sieving. We also provide evidence that the time complexity of this refined BGJ sieve could potentially be $2^{0.292n + o(n)}$, or at least something remarkably close to it. Actually, it outperforms the BDGL sieve in all dimensions that are practically achievable. We hope that this study will contribute to the resolution of the ongoing debate regarding the measurement of RAM access overhead in large-scale, sieving-based lattice attacks.\r\n\r\nThe concept above is also supported by our implementation. Actually, we provide a highly efficient, both in terms of time and memory, CPU-based implementation of the refined BGJ sieve within an optimized sieving framework. This implementation results in approximately 40% savings in RAM usage and is at least $2^{4.5}$ times more efficient in terms of gate count compared to the previous 4-GPU implementation (Ducas-Stevens-Woerden 2021). Notably, we have successfully solved the 183-dimensional SVP Darmstadt Challenge in 30 days using a 112-core server and approximately 0.87TB of RAM. The majority of previous sieving-based SVP computations relied on the HK3-sieve (Herold-Kirshanova 2017), hence this implementation could offer further insights into the behavior of these asymptotically faster sieving algorithms when applied to large-scale problems. Moreover, our refined cost estimation of SVP based on this implementation suggests that some of the NIST PQC candidates, such as Falcon-512, are unlikely to achieve NIST's security requirements.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a significant development for functional encryption (FE) in the multi-user setting, particularly with multi-client functional encryption (MCFE). The challenge becomes more important when combined with access control, such as attribute-based encryption (ABE), which was actually not covered by the FE and MCFE frameworks. On the other hand, as for complex primitives, many works have studied the admissibility of adversaries to ensure that the security model encompasses all real threats of attacks.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, adding a public input to FE/MCFE, we cover many previous primitives, notably attribute-based function classes. Furthermore, with  the strongest admissibility for inner-product functionality, our framework is quite versatile, as it encrypts multiple sub-vectors, allows repetitions and corruptions, and eventually also encompasses public-key FE and classical ABE, bridging the private setting of MCFE with the public setting of FE and ABE.\r\n\r\nFinally, we propose an MCFE with public inputs with the class of functions that combines inner-products (on private inputs) and attribute-based access-control (on public inputs) for LSSS policies. We achieve the first AB-MCFE for inner-products with strong admissibility and with adaptive security. This also leads to MIFE for inner products, public-key single-input inner-product FE with LSSS key-policy and KPABE for LSSS, with adaptive security while the previous AB-MCFE construction of Agrawal et al. from CRYPTO '23 considers a slightly larger functionality of average weighted sum but with selective security only.",

    "abstract": "Many use messaging apps such as Signal to exercise their right to private communication. To cope with the advent of quantum computing, Signal employs a new initial handshake protocol called PQXDH for post-quantum confidentiality, yet keeps guarantees of authenticity and deniability classical. Compared to its predecessor X3DH, PQXDH includes a KEM encapsulation and a signature on the ephemeral key. In this work we show that PQXDH does not meet the same deniability guarantees as X3DH due to the signature on the ephemeral key. Our analysis relies on plaintext awareness of the KEM, which Signal's implementation of PQXDH does not provide. As for X3DH, both parties (initiator and responder) obtain different deniability guarantees due to the asymmetry of the protocol.\r\n\r\nFor our analysis of PQXDH, we introduce a new model for deniability of key exchange that allows a more fine-grained analysis. Our deniability model picks up on the ideas of prior work and facilitates new combinations of deniability notions, such as deniability against malicious adversaries in the big brother model, i.e. where the distinguisher knows all secret keys. Our model may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Universal verifiability is a must-to-have for electronic voting schemes. It is essential to ensure honest behavior of all the players during the whole process, together with the eligibility. However, it should not endanger the privacy of the individual votes, which is another major requirement.\r\nWhereas the first property prevents attacks during the voting process, privacy of the votes should hold forever, which has been called everlasting privacy.\r\n\r\nA classical approach for universal verifiability is to add some proofs together with the encrypted votes, which requires publication of the latter, while eligibility needs a link between the votes and the voters: it definitely excludes long-term privacy. An alternative is the use of perfectly-hiding commitments, on which proofs are published, while ciphertexts are kept private for computing the tally.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we show how recent linearly-homomorphic signatures can be exploited for all the proofs, leading to very efficient procedures towards universal verifiability with both strong receipt-freeness and everlasting privacy.\r\nPrivacy will indeed be unconditional, after the publication of the results and the proofs, whereas the soundness of the proofs holds in the algebraic group model and the random oracle model.",

The idea is to introduce slightly-modified cubes which increase the degrees of 7-round output bits to be more than 59 (break phase) and then find key conditions which can bring the degree back to 59 (fix phase).  \r\nUsing this idea, key-recovery attacks on 7-round Ascon-128, Ascon-128a and Ascon-80pq are proposed. \r\nThe attacks have better time/memory complexities than the existing attacks, and in some cases improve the weak-key attacks as well.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a new approach to secure computing by implementing a platform that utilizes an NVMe-based system with an FPGA-based Torus FHE accelerator, SSD, and middleware on the host-side. Our platform is the first of its kind to offer complete secure computing capabilities for TFHE using an FPGA-based accelerator. We have defined secure computing instructions to evaluate 14-bit to 14-bit functions using TFHE, and our middleware allows for communication of ciphertexts, keys, and secure computing programs while invoking secure computing programs through NVMe commands with metadata. Our CMux gate implementation features an optimized NTT/INTT circuit that eliminates pre-NTT and post-INTT operations by pre-scaling and pre-transforming constant polynomials such as the bootstrapping and private-functional key-switching keys. Our performance evaluation demonstrates that our secure computing platform outperforms CPU-based and GPU-based platforms by 15 to 120 times and by 2.5 to 3 times, respectively, in gate bootstrapping execution time. Additionally, our platform uses 7 to 12 times less electric energy consumption during the gate bootstrapping execution time compared to CPU-based platforms and 1.15 to 1.2 times less compared to GPU-based platforms.",

    "abstract": "A transciphering framework, also known as hybrid homomorphic encryption, is a practical method of combining a homomorphic encryption~(HE) scheme with a symmetric cipher in the client-server model to reduce computational and communication overload on the client side. As a server homomorphically evaluates a symmetric cipher in this framework, new design rationales are required for ``HE-friendly'' ciphers that take into account the specific properties of the HE schemes.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose a new TFHE-friendly cipher, dubbed $\\mathsf{FRAST}$, with a TFHE-friendly round function based on a random S-box to minimize the number of rounds.\r\nThe round function of $\\mathsf{FRAST}$ can be efficiently evaluated in TFHE by a new optimization technique, dubbed double blind rotation.\r\nCombined with our new WoP-PBS method, the double blind rotation allows computing multiple S-box calls in the round function of $\\mathsf{FRAST}$ at the cost of a single S-box call.\r\nIn this way, $\\mathsf{FRAST}$ enjoys $2.768$ (resp. $10.57$) times higher throughput compared to $\\mathsf{Kreyvium}$ (resp. $\\mathsf{Elisabeth}$) for TFHE keystream evaluation in the offline phase of the transciphering framework at the cost of slightly larger communication overload.",

    "abstract": "Messaging Layer Security (MLS) is a Secure Group Messaging protocol that uses for its handshake a binary tree \u2013 called a Ratchet Tree \u2013 in order to reach a logarithmic communication cost w.r.t. the number of group members. This Ratchet Tree represents users as its leaves; therefore any change in the group membership results in adding or removing a leaf associated with that user. MLS consequently implements what we call a tree evolution mechanism, consisting in a user add algorithm \u2013 determining where to insert a new leaf \u2013 and a tree expansion process \u2013 stating how to increase the size of the tree when no space is available for a new user.\r\n\r\nThe tree evolution mechanism currently used by MLS is de-\r\nsigned so that it naturally left-balances the Ratchet Tree. However, such a Ratchet Tree structure is often quite inefficient in terms of communication cost. Furthermore, one may wonder whether the binary tree used in that Ratchet Tree has a degree optimized for the features of a handshake in MLS \u2013 called a commit.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we study in this paper how to improve the communication cost of a commit in MLS by considering both the tree evolution mechanism and the tree degree used for the Ratchet Tree. To do so, we determine the tree structure that optimizes its communication cost, and we propose optimized algorithms for both the user add and tree expansion processes, that allow to remain close to that optimal structure and thus to have a communication cost as close to optimal as possible.\r\n\r\nWe also determine the Ratchet Tree degree that is best suited to a given set of parameters induced by the encryption scheme used by MLS. This study shows that when using classical (i.e. pre-quantum) ciphersuites, a binary tree is indeed the most appropriate Ratchet Tree; nevertheless, when it comes to post-quantum algorithms, it generally becomes more interesting to use instead a ternary tree.\r\n\r\nOur improvements do not change TreeKEM protocol and are\r\neasy to implement. With parameter sets corresponding to practical ciphersuites, they reduce TreeKEM\u2019s communication cost by 5 to 10%. In particular, the 10% gain appears in the Post-Quantum setting \u2013 when both an optimized tree evolution mechanism and a ternary tree are necessary \u2013, which is precisely the context where any optimization of the protocol\u2019s communication cost is welcome, due to the important bandwidth of PQ encrypted communication.",

    "abstract": "In this work we introduce PERK a compact digital signature scheme  based on the hardness of a new variant of the Permuted Kernel Problem (PKP). PERK achieves the smallest signature sizes for any PKP-based scheme for NIST category I security with 6 kB, while obtaining competitive signing and verification timings. PERK also compares well with the general state-of-the-art. To substantiate those claims we provide an optimized constant-time AVX2 implementation, a detailed performance analysis and different size-performance trade-offs. \r\n\r\nTechnically our scheme is based on a Zero-Knowledge Proof of Knowledge  following the MPC-in-the-Head paradigm and employing the Fiat-Shamir transform. We provide comprehensive security proofs, ensuring EUF-CMA security for PERK in the random oracle model. The efficiency of PERK greatly stems from our particular choice of PKP variant which allows for an application of the challenge-space amplification technique due to Bidoux-Gaborit (C2SI 2023).\r\n\r\nOur second main contribution is an in-depth study of the hardness of the introduced problem variant. First, we establish a link between the hardness of our problem variant and the hardness of standard PKP. Then, we initiate an in-depth study of the concrete complexity to solve our variant. We present a novel algorithm which outperforms previous approaches for certain parameter regimes. However, the proximity of our problem variant to the standard variant can be controlled via a specific parameter. This enables us to effectively safeguard against our new attack and potential future extensions by a choice of parameters that ensures only a slight variation from standard PKP.",

    "abstract": "Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a generalization of public-key encryption that enables fine-grained access control to encrypted data. In (ciphertext-policy) ABE, a central trusted authority issues decryption keys for attributes $x$ to users. In turn, ciphertexts are associated with a decryption policy $\\mathcal{P}$. Decryption succeeds and recovers the encrypted message whenever $\\mathcal{P}(x) = 1$. Recently, Hohenberger, Lu, Waters, and Wu (Eurocrypt 2023) introduced the notion of registered ABE, which is an ABE scheme without a trusted central authority. Instead, users generate their own public/secret keys (just like in public-key encryption) and then register their keys (and attributes) with a key curator. The key curator is a transparent and untrusted entity.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the best pairing-based registered ABE schemes support monotone Boolean formulas and an a priori bounded number of users $L$. A major limitation of existing schemes is that they require a (structured) common reference string (CRS) of size $L^2 \\cdot |\\mathcal{U}|$ where $|\\mathcal{U}|$ is the size of the attribute universe. In other words, the size of the CRS scales quadratically with the number of users and multiplicatively with the size of the attribute universe. The large CRS makes these schemes expensive in practice and limited to a small number of users and a small universe of attributes.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we give two ways to reduce the CRS size in pairing-based registered ABE schemes. First, we introduce a combinatoric technique based on progression-free sets that enables registered ABE for the same class of policies but with a CRS whose size is sub-quadratic in the number of users. Asymptotically, we obtain a scheme where the CRS size is nearly linear in the number of users $L$ (i.e., $L^{1 + o(1)}$). If we take a more concrete-efficiency-oriented focus, we can instantiate our framework to obtain a construction with a CRS of size $L^{\\log_2 3} \\approx L^{1.6}$. For instance, in a scheme for 100,000 users, our approach reduces the CRS by a factor of over $115\\times$ compared to previous approaches (and without incurring any overhead in encryption/decryption time). Our second approach for reducing the CRS size is to rely on a partitioning-based argument when arguing security of the registered ABE scheme. Previous approaches took a dual-system approach. Using a partitioning-based argument yields a registered ABE scheme where the size of the CRS is independent of the size of the attribute universe. The cost is the resulting scheme satisfies a weaker notion of static security. Our techniques for reducing the CRS size can be combined, and taken together, we obtain a pairing-based registered ABE scheme that supports monotone Boolean formulas with a CRS size of $L^{1 + o(1)}$. Notably, this is the first pairing-based registered ABE scheme that does not require imposing a bound on the size of the attribute universe during setup time.\r\n\r\nAs an additional application, we also show how to apply our techniques based on progression-free sets to the batch argument (BARG) for $\\mathsf{NP}$ scheme of Waters and Wu (Crypto 2022) to obtain a scheme with a nearly-linear CRS without needing to rely on non-black-box bootstrapping techniques.",

    "abstract": "Multi-scalar multiplication (MSM) is one of the core components of many zero-knowledge proof systems, and a primary performance bottleneck for proof generation in these schemes.  One major strategy to accelerate MSM is utilizing precomputation.  Several algorithms (e.g., Pippenger and BGMW) and their variants have been proposed in this direction. In this paper, we revisit the recent precomputation-based MSM calculation method proposed by Luo, Fu and Gong at CHES 2023 and generalize their approach. In particular, we presented a general construction of optimal buckets. This improvement leads to significant performance improvements, which are verified by both theoretical analysis and experiments.",

    "abstract": "Unclonable cryptography is concerned with leveraging the no-cloning principle to build cryptographic primitives that are otherwise impossible to achieve classically. Understanding the feasibility of unclonable encryption, one of the key unclonable primitives, satisfying indistinguishability security in the plain model has been a major open question in the area. So far, the existing constructions of unclonable encryption are either in the quantum random oracle model or are based on new conjectures.\r\n\r\nWe present a new approach to unclonable encryption via a reduction to a novel\r\nquestion about nonlocal quantum state discrimination: how well can\r\nnon-communicating -- but entangled -- players distinguish between different distributions over quantum states? We call this task simultaneous state indistinguishability. Our main technical result is showing that the players cannot distinguish between each player receiving independently-chosen Haar random states versus all players receiving the same Haar random state.\r\n\r\nWe leverage this result to present the first construction of unclonable\r\nencryption satisfying indistinguishability security, with quantum decryption\r\nkeys, in the plain model. We also show other implications to single-decryptor\r\nencryption and leakage-resilient secret sharing.",

    "abstract": "Embedded curves are elliptic curves defined over a prime field whose order (characteristic) is the prime subgroup order (the scalar field) of a pairing-friendly curve. Embedded curves have a large prime-order subgroup of cryptographic size but are not pairing-friendly themselves. Sanso and El Housni published families of embedded curves for BLS pairing-friendly curves. Their families are parameterized by polynomials, like families of pairing-friendly curves are. However their work did not found embedded families for KSS pairing-friendly curves. In this note we show how the problem of finding families of embedded curves is related to the problem of finding optimal formulas for $\\G_1$ subgroup membership testing on the pairing-friendly curve side. Then we apply Smith's technique and Dai, Lin, Zhao, and Zhou (DLZZ) criteria to obtain the formulas of embedded curves with KSS, and outline a generic algorithm for solving this problem in all cases. We provide two families of embedded curves of prime-order for KSS18 that can form a plain cycle, and give examples of cryptographic size. We also give families of even-order $j=1728$ embedded curves for KSS16 with examples. We also suggest alternative embedded curves for BLS that have a seed of much lower Hamming weight than Sanso et al.~and much higher 2-valuation for fast FFT. In particular we highlight BLS12 curves which have a prime-order embedded curve that form a plain cycle (no pairing), and a second (plain) embedded curve in Montgomery form. A Brezing-Weng outer curve to have a pairing-friendly 2-chain is also possible like in the BLS12-377-BW6-761 construction. All curves have $j$-invariant 0 and an endomorphism for a faster arithmetic on the curve side.",

    "abstract": "In many real-world scenarios, there are cases where a client wishes\r\nto check if a data element they hold is included in a set segmented\r\nacross a large number of data holders. To protect user privacy, the\r\nclient\u2019s query and the data holders\u2019 sets should remain encrypted\r\nthroughout the whole process. Prior work on Private Set Intersection (PSI), Multi-Party PSI (MPSI), Private Membership Test (PMT),\r\nand Oblivious RAM (ORAM) falls short in this scenario in many\r\nways. They either require data holders to possess the sets in plain-\r\ntext, incur prohibitively high latency for aggregating results from a\r\nlarge number of data holders, leak the information about the party\r\nholding the intersection element, or induce a high false positive.\r\nThis paper introduces the primitive of a Private Segmented Mem-\r\nbership Test (PSMT). We give a basic construction of a protocol to\r\nsolve PSMT using a threshold variant of approximate-arithmetic\r\nhomomorphic encryption and show how to overcome existing\r\nchallenges to construct a PSMT protocol without leaking information about the party holding the intersection element or false\r\npositives for a large number of data holders ensuring IND-CPA^\ud835\udc37\r\nsecurity. Our novel approach is superior to existing state-of-the-art\r\napproaches in scalability with regard to the number of supported\r\ndata holders. This is enabled by a novel summation-based homo-\r\nmorphic membership check rather than a product-based one, as\r\nwell as various novel ideas addressing technical challenges. Our\r\nPSMT protocol supports many more parties (up to 4096 in experiments) compared to prior related work that supports only around\r\n100 parties efficiently. Our experimental evaluation shows that our\r\nmethod\u2019s aggregation of results from data holders can run in 92.5s\r\nfor 1024 data holders and a set size of 2^25, and our method\u2019s over-\r\nhead increases very slowly with the increasing number of senders.\r\nWe also compare our PSMT protocol to other state-of-the-art PSI\r\nand MPSI protocols and discuss our improvements in usability with\r\na better privacy model and a larger number of parties",

    "abstract": "Creating an adversary resilient construction of the Learned Bloom Filter with provable guarantees is an open problem. We define a strong adversarial model for the Learned Bloom Filter. Our adversarial model extends an existing adversarial model designed for the Classical (i.e not ``Learned'') Bloom Filter by prior work and considers computationally bounded adversaries that run in probabilistic polynomial time (PPT). Using our model, we construct an adversary resilient variant of the Learned Bloom Filter called the Downtown Bodega Filter. We show that: if pseudo-random permutations exist, then an Adversary Resilient Learned Bloom Filter may be constructed with $2\\lambda$ extra bits of memory and at most one extra pseudo-random permutation in the critical path. We construct a hybrid adversarial model for the case where a fraction of the query workload is chosen by an adversary. We show realistic scenarios where using the Downtown Bodega Filter gives better performance guarantees compared to alternative approaches in this hybrid model.",

    "abstract": "Asymmetric Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (aPAKE) protocols, particularly Strong aPAKE (saPAKE) have enjoyed significant attention, both from academia and industry, with the well-known OPAQUE protocol currently undergoing standardization. In (s)aPAKE, a client and a server collaboratively establish a high-entropy key, relying on a previously exchanged password for authentication. A main feature is its resilience against offline and precomputation (for saPAKE) attacks. OPAQUE, as well as most other aPAKE protocols, have been designed and analyzed in a single-user setting, i.e., modelling that only a single user interacts with the server. By the composition framework of UC, security for the actual multi-user setting is then conjectured. As any real-world (s)aPAKE instantiation will need to cater multiple users, this introduces a dangerous gap in which developers are tasked to extend the single-user protocol securely and in a UC-compliant manner.\r\nIn this work, we extend the (s)aPAKE definition to directly model the multi-user setting, and explicitly capture the impact that a server compromise has across user accounts. We show that the currently standardized multi-user version of OPAQUE might not provide the expected security, as it is insecure against offline attacks as soon as the file for one user in the system is compromised. This is due to using shared state among different users, which violates the UC composition framework. However, we show that another change introduced in the standardization draft which also involves a shared state does not compromise security. When extending the aPAKE security in the multi-client setting, we notice that the widely used security definition captures significantly weaker security guarantees than what is offered by many protocols. Essentially, the aPAKE definition assumes that the server stores unsalted password-hashes, whereas several protocols explicitly use a salt to protect against precomputation attacks. We therefore propose a definitional framework that captures different salting approaches -- thus showing that the security gap between aPAKE and saPAKE can be smaller than expected.",

    "abstract": "In our highly digitalized world, an adversary is not constrained to purely digital attacks but can monitor or influence the physical execution environment of a target computing device. Such side-channel or fault-injection analysis poses a significant threat to otherwise secure cryptographic implementations. Hence, it is important to consider additional adversarial capabilities when analyzing the security of cryptographic implementations besides the default black-box model. For side-channel analysis, this is done by providing the adversary with knowledge of some internal values, while for fault-injection analysis the capabilities of the adversaries include manipulation of some internal values.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we extend probabilistic security models for physical attacks, by introducing a general random probing model and a general random fault model to capture arbitrary leakage and fault distributions, as well as the combination of these models.  Our aim is to enable a more accurate modeling of low-level physical effects. We then analyze important properties, such as the impact of adversarial knowledge on faults and compositions, and provide tool-based formal verification methods that allow the security assessment of design components. These methods are introduced as extension of previous tools VERICA and IronMask which are implemented, evaluated and compared.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate public key cryptography (MPKC) is one of the most promising alternatives to build quantum-resistant signature schemes, as evidenced in NIST's call for additional post-quantum signature schemes. The main assumption in MPKC is the hardness of the Multivariate Quadratic (MQ) problem, which seeks for a common root to a system of quadratic polynomials over a finite field. Although the Crossbred algorithm is among the most efficient algorithm to solve MQ over small fields, its complexity analysis stands on shaky ground. In particular, it is not clear for what parameters it works and under what assumptions.\r\nIn this work, we provide a rigorous analysis of the Crossbred algorithm over any finite field. We provide a complete explanation of the series of admissible parameters proposed in previous literature and explicitly state the regularity assumptions required for its validity.  Moreover, we show that the series does not tell the whole story, hence we propose an additional condition for Crossbred to work. Additionally, we define and characterize a notion of regularity for systems over a small field, which is one of the main building blocks in the series of admissible parameters.",

    "abstract": "We study watermarking schemes for language models with provable guarantees. As we show, prior works offer no robustness guarantees against adaptive prompting: when a user queries a language model more than once, as even benign users do. And with just a single exception (Christ and Gunn, 2024), prior works are restricted to zero-bit watermarking:  machine-generated text can be detected as such, but no additional information can be extracted from the watermark. Unfortunately, merely detecting AI-generated text may not prevent future abuses.\r\n\r\nWe introduce multi-user watermarks, which allow tracing model-generated text to individual users or to groups of colluding users, even in the face of adaptive prompting. We construct multi-user watermarking schemes from undetectable, adaptively robust, zero-bit watermarking schemes (and prove that the undetectable zero-bit scheme of Christ, Gunn, and Zamir (2024) is adaptively robust). Importantly, our scheme provides both zero-bit and multi-user assurances at the same time. It detects shorter snippets just as well as the original scheme, and traces longer excerpts to individuals. \r\n\r\nThe main technical component is a construction of message-embedding watermarks from zero-bit watermarks. Ours is the first generic reduction between watermarking schemes for language models.  A challenge for such reductions is the lack of a unified abstraction for robustness --- that marked text is detectable even after edits. We introduce a new unifying abstraction called AEB-robustness. AEB-robustness provides that the watermark is detectable whenever the edited text \"approximates enough blocks\" of model-generated output.",

    "abstract": "We introduce SQIsign2D-West, a variant of SQIsign using two-dimensional isogeny representations.\r\nSQIsignHD was the first variant of SQIsign to use higher dimensional isogeny representations. Its eight-dimensional variant is geared towards provable security but is deemed unpractical. Its four-dimensional variant is geared towards efficiency and has significantly faster signing times than SQIsign, but slower verification owing to the complexity of the four-dimensional representation. Its authors commented on the apparent difficulty of getting any improvement over SQIsign by using two-dimensional representations.\r\nIn this work, we introduce new algorithmic tools that make two-dimensional representations a viable alternative. These lead to a signature scheme with sizes comparable to SQIsignHD, slightly slower signing than SQIsignHD but still much faster than SQIsign, and the fastest verification of any known variant of SQIsign. We achieve this without compromising on the security proof: the assumptions behind SQIsign2D-West are similar to those of the eight-dimensional variant of SQIsignHD. Additionally, like SQIsignHD, SQIsign2D-West favourably scales to high levels of security Concretely, for NIST level I we achieve signing times of 80 ms and verifying times of 4.5 ms, using optimised arithmetic based on intrinsics available to the Ice Lake architecture. For NIST level V, we achieve 470 ms for signing and 31 ms for verifying.",

    "abstract": "For security issue, data in cloud is encrypted. Searching encrypted data (without decryption) is a practical and important problem. Public key authenticated encryption with keyword search (PAEKS) enables the retrieval of encrypted data, while resisting the insider keyword guessing attacks (IKGAs). Most PAEKS schemes only work with single-receiver model, exhibiting very limited applicability. To address this concern, there have been researches on broadcast authenticated encryption with keyword search (BAEKS) to achieve multi-receiver ciphertext search. But to our best knowledge, existing BAEKS schemes are not quantum resistant. In this paper, we propose lattice-based BAEKS, the first post-quantum broadcast authenticated encryption with keyword search in multi-receiver model. In particular, we leverage several lattice sampling algorithms and rejection sampling technique to construct our BAEKS scheme. We also incorporate the minimal cover set technique and lattice basis extension algorithm to construct an enhanced version, namely FS-BAEKS, which addresses the secret key leakage problem. We give a rigorous security analysis of our schemes. For the efficiency of BAEKS and Test algorithms in our BAEKS scheme, the computational overheads are at least 2x and 89x faster than the state-of-the-art schemes respectively, which is practical for cloud storage systems.",

    "abstract": "Threshold public key encryption schemes distribute secret keys among multiple parties, known as the committee, to reduce reliance on a single trusted entity. \r\nHowever, existing schemes face inefficiencies as the committee should perform computation and communication for decryption of each individual ciphertext.\r\nAs the number of ciphertexts being decrypted per unit of time increases, this can limit the number of committee parties and their decentralization due to increased hardware requirements, heightening the risk of adversarial collusion.\r\nTo address this, we introduce tag-based batched threshold encryption (TBTE), which ensures constant computational and communication costs per committee member, independent of the number of ciphertexts being decrypted in batch under distinct decryption policies. \r\nThe TBTE scheme is constructed over bilinear groups in the random oracle model and secure in the algebraic group model, assuming the hardness of the $(q_1,q_2)$-discrete logarithm problem and the EAV-security of the symmetric-key encryption scheme.\r\nEvaluation of our implementation demonstrates constant data size, specifically 48 bytes received and 56 bytes sent, and constant execution time for each committee party during decryption, even for various batch sizes up to $2^{20}$.",

    "abstract": "With the rise of quantum computing, the security of traditional cryptographic systems, especially those vulnerable to quantum attacks, is under threat. While public key cryptography has been widely studied in post-quantum security, symmetric-key cryptography has received less attention. This paper explores using the Ajtai-Micciancio hash function, based on the Short Integer Solution (SIS) problem, as a pseudorandom function in the Luby-Rackoff cipher. Since lattice-based problems like SIS are believed to resist quantum algorithms, this approach provides the potential for a quantum-resistant block cipher. We also propose a novel statistical method based on the Generalized Extreme Value distribution to evaluate the number of secure rounds and resistance to differential cryptanalysis.",

    "abstract": "Decentralized Multi-Client Functional Encryption (DMCFE) extends the basic functional encryption to multiple clients that do not trust each other. They can independently encrypt the multiple plaintext-inputs to be given for evaluation to the function embedded in the functional decryption key, defined by multiple parameter-inputs. And they keep control on these functions as they all have to contribute to the generation of the functional decryption keys. Tags can be used in the ciphertexts and the keys to specify which inputs can be combined together. As any encryption scheme, DMCFE provides privacy of the plaintexts. But the functions associated to the functional decryption keys might be sensitive too (e.g. a model in machine learning). The function-hiding property has thus been introduced to additionally protect the function evaluated during the decryption process.\r\n\r\n  In this paper, we provide new proof techniques to analyze a new concrete construction of function-hiding DMCFE for inner products, with strong security guarantees in the random oracle model: the adversary can adaptively query multiple challenge ciphertexts and multiple challenge keys, with unbounded repetitions of the same message tags in the ciphertext-queries and a fixed polynomially-large number of repetitions of the same key tags in the key-queries, allowing static corruption of the secret encryption keys. Previous constructions were proven secure in the selective setting only.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new unified framework to construct multi-server, information-theoretic Private Information Retrieval (PIR) schemes that leverage global preprocesing to achieve sublinear computation per query.\r\nDespite a couple earlier attempts, our understanding of PIR schemes in the global preprocessing model remains limited, and so far, we only know a few sparse points in the broad design space.\r\nOur framework not only unifies earlier results in this space, but leads to several new results. First, we can improve the server space of the state-of-the-art scheme by a polynomial factor. Second, we can broaden the parameter space of known results, allowing a smooth tradeoff between bandwidth and computation.  Third, while earlier schemes achieve better per-server bandwidth and computation as we add more servers, the server space actually grows w.r.t. the number of servers.  We offer a new scalable family of schemes where the per-server bandwidth, computation, and space all decrease as we add more servers. This scalable family of schemes also implies the so-called ``doubly efficient'' PIR scheme with any super-constant number of servers, achieving $n^{1+o(1)}$ server space and preprocessing cost, and $n^{o(1)}$ bandwidth and computation per query.",

    "abstract": "This work resolves the open problem of whether verifiable delay functions (VDFs) can be constructed in the random oracle model.\r\nA VDF is a cryptographic primitive that requires a long time to compute (even with parallelization), but produces a unique output that is efficiently and publicly verifiable. \r\n\r\nWe prove that VDFs with \\emph{imperfect completeness} and \\emph{computational uniqueness} do not exist in the random oracle model. This also rules out black-box constructions of VDFs from other cryptographic primitives, such as one-way permutations and collision-resistant hash functions.\r\n\r\nPrior to our work, Mahmoody, Smith and Wu (ICALP 2020) prove that VDFs satisfying both \\emph{perfect completeness} and \\emph{perfect uniqueness} do not exist in the random oracle model; on the other hand, Ephraim, Freitag, Komargodski, and Pass (Eurocrypt 2020) construct VDFs with \\emph{perfect completeness} and \\emph{computational uniqueness} in the random oracle model assuming the hardness of repeated squaring. Our result is optimal -- we bridge the current gap between previously known impossibility results and existing constructions.",

    "abstract": "The Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) fully homomorphic encryption scheme is designed to efficiently perform computations on real numbers in an encrypted state. Recently, Drucker et al. [J. Cryptol.] proposed an efficient  strategy to use CKKS in a black-box manner to perform computations on binary data.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we introduce several CKKS bootstrapping algorithms designed specifically for ciphertexts encoding binary data. Crucially, the new CKKS bootstrapping algorithms enable to bootstrap ciphertexts containing the binary data in the most significant bits. First, this allows to decrease the moduli used in bootstrapping, saving a larger share of the modulus budget for non-bootstrapping operations.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we obtain full-slot bootstrapping in ring degree $2^{14}$ for the first time. Second, the ciphertext format is compatible with the one used in the DM/CGGI fully homomorphic encryption schemes. Interestingly, we may combine our CKKS bootstrapping algorithms for bits with the fast ring packing technique from Bae et al. [CRYPTO'23]. This leads to a new bootstrapping algorithm for DM/CGGI that outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches when the number of bootstraps to be performed simultaneously is in the low hundreds.",

    "abstract": "The assumption that certain computations inherently require some sequential time has established itself as a powerful tool for cryptography. It allows for security and liveness guarantees in distributed protocols that are impossible to achieve with classical hardness assumptions. Unfortunately, many constructions from the realm of time-based cryptography are based on new and poorly understood hardness assumptions, which tend not to stand the test of time (cf. Leurent et al. 2023, Peikert & Tang 2023).\r\nIn this work, we make progress on several fronts. We formally define the concept of a delay function and present a construction thereof from minimal assumptions. We show that these functions, in combination with classical cryptographic objects that satisfy certain efficiency criteria, would allow for constructing delay encryption, which is otherwise only known to exist based on a new hardness assumption about isogenies. We formally define randomness beacons as they are used in the context of blockchains, and we show that (linearly homomorphic) time-lock puzzles allow for efficiently constructing them. \r\nOur work puts time-based cryptography on a firmer theoretical footing, provides new constructions from simpler assumptions, and opens new avenues for constructing delay encryption.",

    "abstract": "Byzantine broadcast is one of the fundamental problems in distributed computing. Many of its practical applications, from multiparty computation to consensus mechanisms for blockchains,  require increasingly weaker trust assumptions, as well as scalability for an ever-growing number of users $n$. This rules out existing solutions which run in a linear number of rounds in $n$ or rely on trusted setup requirements. In this paper, we propose the first sublinear-round and trustless Byzantine broadcast protocol for the dishonest majority setting. Unlike previous sublinear-round protocols, our protocol assumes neither the existence of a trusted dealer who honestly issues keys and correlated random strings to the parties nor random oracles. Instead, we present a solution whose setup is limited to an unstructured uniform reference string and a plain public key infrastructure (a.k.a. bulletin-board PKI).\r\nOur broadcast protocol builds on top of a moderated gradecast protocol which parties can use to reach weak agreement on shared random strings. Using these strings, we can then run in an unbiased fashion a committee-based Byzantine protocol, similar to that of Chan et al. (PKC 2020), which terminates in a sublinear number of rounds. To this end, we propose a novel construction for committee election, which does not rely either on random oracles or on a trusted setup, and uses NIZKs and time-lock puzzles.  Our protocol is resilient against an adaptive adversary who corrupts any constant fraction of parties.",

    "abstract": "Isogeny-based cryptography is cryptographic schemes whose security is based on the hardness of a mathematical problem called the isogeny problem, and is attracting attention as one of the candidates for post-quantum cryptography. A representative isogeny-based cryptography is the signature scheme called SQIsign, which was submitted to the NIST PQC standardization competition. SQIsign has attracted much attention because of its very short signature and key size among the candidates for the NIST PQC standardization. Recently, a lot of new schemes have been proposed that use high-dimensional isogenies. Among them, the signature scheme called SQIsignHD has an even shorter signature size than SQIsign. However, it requires 4-dimensional isogeny computations for the signature verification.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose a new signature scheme, SQIsign2D-East, which requires only two-dimensional isogeny computations for verification, thus reducing the computational cost of verification. First, we generalized an algorithm called RandIsogImg, which computes a random isogeny of non-smooth degree. Then, by using this generalized RandIsogImg, we construct a new signature scheme SQIsign2D-East.",

    "abstract": "A secret sharing scheme is a cryptographic primitive that allows a dealer to share a secret among a set of parties, so that only authorized subsets of them can recover it. The access structure of the scheme is the family of authorized subsets.\r\n\r\nIn a weighted threshold access structure, each party is assigned a weight according to its importance, and the authorized subsets are those in which the sum of their weights is at least the threshold value. For these access structures, the share size of the best known secret sharing schemes is either linear on the weights or quasipolynomial on the number of parties, which leads to long shares, in general. \r\n\r\nIn certain settings, a way to circumvent this efficiency problem is to approximate the access structure by another one that admits more efficient schemes. This work is dedicated to the open problem posed by this strategy: Finding secret sharing schemes with a good tradeoff between the efficiency and the accuracy of the approximation.\r\n\r\nWe present a method to approximate weighted threshold access structures by others that admit schemes with small shares. This method is based on the techniques for the approximation of the Chow parameters developed by De et al. [Journal of the ACM, 2014]. Our method provides secret sharing schemes with share size $n^{1+o(1)}$, where $n$ is the number of parties, and whose access structure is close to the original one. Namely, in this approximation the condition of being authorized or not is preserved for almost all subsets of parties. \r\n\r\nIn addition, applying the recent results on computational secret sharing schemes by Applebaum et al. [STOC, 2023] we show that there exist computational secret sharing schemes whose security is based on the RSA assumption and whose share size is polylogarithmic in the number of parties.",

    "abstract": "We introduce SQIPrime, a post-quantum digital signature scheme based on the Deuring correspondence and Kani's Lemma. \r\nCompared to its predecessors that are SQISign and especially SQISignHD, SQIPrime further expands the use of high dimensional isogenies, already in use in the verification in SQISignHD, to all its subroutines.\r\nIn doing so, it no longer relies on smooth degree isogenies (of dimension 1). Intriguingly, this includes  the challenge isogeny which is also a non-smooth degree isogeny, but has an accessible kernel. The fact that the isogenies do not have rational kernel allows to fit more rational power 2 torsion points which are necessary when computing and representing the response isogeny. \r\nSQIPrime operates with prime numbers of the form $p = 2^\\alpha f-1$. \r\n\r\nWe describe two variants of SQIPrime. SQIPrime4D which incorporates the novelties described above and uses dimension 4 isogenies to represent the response isogeny. The runtime of higher dimensional isogeny computation is exponential in the dimension, hence the smaller the dimension the better for efficiency. The second variant, SQIPrime2D,  solely uses dimension 2 isogenies. This is achieved by setting the degree of the secret isogeny to be equal to that of the challenge isogeny and  further exploiting Kani's Lemma. SQIPrime2D is more efficient compared to SQIPrime4D and to SQISignHD, at the cost of being comparatively less compact, but still very compact compared to non isogeny based post-quantum signatures.",

    "abstract": "Byzantine  Reliable  Broadcast  is  one of the most popular communication  primitives in distributed systems.  Byzantine reliable broadcast ensures that  processes agree to deliver  a  message  from  an initiator even if some processes (perhaps including the initiator) are Byzantine. In asynchronous settings it is known since the prominent work of Bracha [Bracha87] that Byzantine  reliable  broadcast can be implemented deterministically if $n \\geq 3t+1$ where $t$ is an upper bound on the number of Byzantine processes. Here, we study Byzantine Reliable Broadcast when processes are equipped with trusted execution environments (TEEs), special software or hardware designed to prevent equivocation. Our contribution is twofold. First, we show that, despite common belief, when each process is equipped with a TEE, Bracha's algorithm still needs $n \\geq 3t+1$. Second, we present a novel algorithm that uses a single TEE (at the initiator) that implements Byzantine Reliable  Asynchronous Broadcast with $n \\geq 2t+1$.",

    "abstract": "Over the last two decades, microarchitectural side channels have been the focus of a large body of research on the development of new attack techniques, exploiting them to attack various classes of targets and designing mitigations. One line of work focuses on increasing the speed of the attacks, achieving higher levels of temporal resolution that can allow attackers to learn finer-grained information. The most recent addition to this line of work is Prime+Scope [CCS '21], which only requires a single access to the L1 cache to confirm the absence of victim activity in a cache set. While significantly faster than prior attacks, Prime+Scope is still an order of magnitude slower than cache access. In this work, we set out to close this gap.\r\n\r\nWe draw on techniques from research into microarchitectural weird gates, software constructs that exploit transient execution to perform arbitrary computation on cache state. We design the Spec-o-Scope gate, a new weird gate that performs 10 cache probes in quick succession, and forms the basis for our eponymous attack. Our Spec-o-Scope attack achieves an order of magnitude improvement in temporal resolution compared to the previous state-of-the-art of Prime+Scope, reducing the measurement time from ~70 cycles to only 5 --- only one cycle more than an L1 cache access. We experimentally verify that our attack can detect timing differences in a 5 cycle resolution. Finally, using our Spec-o-Scope attack, we show the first microarchitectural side-channel attack on an unmodified AES S-box-based implementation, which uses generic CPU features and does not require manipulation of the operating system's scheduler.",

    "abstract": "In an Instance-Hiding Interactive Proof (IHIP) [Beaver et al. CRYPTO 90], an efficient verifier with a _private_ input x interacts with an unbounded prover to determine whether x is contained in a language L. In addition to completeness and soundness, the instance-hiding property requires that the prover should not learn anything about x in the course of the interaction. Such proof systems capture natural privacy properties, and may be seen as a generalization of the influential concept of Randomized Encodings [Ishai et al. FOCS 00, Applebaum et al. FOCS 04, Agrawal et al. ICALP 15], and as a counterpart to Zero-Knowledge proofs [Goldwasser et al. STOC 89]. \r\n\r\nWe investigate the properties and power of such instance-hiding proofs, and show the following:\r\n1. Any language with an IHIP is contained in NP/poly and coNP/poly.\r\n2. If an average-case hard language has an IHIP, then One-Way Functions exist.\r\n3. There is an oracle with respect to which there is a language that has an IHIP but not an SZK proof.\r\n4. IHIP's are closed under composition with any efficiently computable function.\r\n\r\nWe further study a stronger version of IHIP (that we call Simulatable IHIP) where the view of the honest prover can be efficiently simulated. For these, we obtain stronger versions of some of the above:\r\n5. Any language with a Simulatable IHIP is contained in AM and coAM.\r\n6. If a _worst-case_ hard language has a Simulatable IHIP, then One-Way Functions exist.",

    "abstract": "The One-Way to Hiding (O2H) theorem, first given by Unruh (J ACM 2015) and then restated by Ambainis et al. (CRYPTO 2019), is a crucial technique for solving the reprogramming problem in the quantum random oracle model (QROM). It provides an upper bound $d\\cdot\\sqrt{\\epsilon}$ for the distinguisher's advantage, where $d$ is the query depth and $\\epsilon$ denotes the advantage of a one-wayness attacker. Later, in order to obtain a tighter upper bound, Kuchta et al. (EUROCRYPT 2020) proposed the Measure-Rewind-Measure (MRM) technique and then proved the Measure-Rewind-Measure O2H (MRM-O2H) theorem, which provides the upper bound $d\\cdot\\epsilon$. They also proposed an open question: Can we combine their MRM technique with Ambainis et al.'s semi-classical oracle technique (CRYPTO 2019) or Zhandry's compressed oracle technique (CRYPTO 2019) to prove a new O2H theorem with an upper bound even tighter than $d\\cdot\\epsilon$?\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we give an affirmative answer for the above question. We propose a new technique named Measure-Rewind-Extract (MRE) by combining the MRM technique with the semi-classical oracle technique. By using MRE technique, we prove the Measure-Rewind-Extract O2H (MRE-O2H) theorem, which provides the upper bound $\\sqrt{d}\\cdot\\epsilon$.\r\n\r\nAs an important application of our MRE-O2H theorem, for the $FO^{\\cancel{\\bot}}$, $FO_m^{\\cancel{\\bot}}$, $FO^{\\bot}$ and $FO_m^\\bot$ proposed by Hofheinz et al. (TCC 2017), i.e., the key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) variants of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transformation, we prove the following results in the QROM:\r\n\r\nTheir IND-CCA security can be reduced to the IND-CPA security of the underlying public key encryption (PKE) scheme without the square-root advantage loss. In particular, compared with the IND-CCA proof of $FO^{\\cancel{\\bot}}$ given by Kuchta et al. (EUROCRYPT 2020), ours removes the injectivity assumption and has a tighter security bound.\r\n\r\nUnder the assumption that the underlying PKE scheme is unique randomness recoverable, we for the first time prove that their IND-CCA security can be reduced to the OW-CPA security of the underlying PKE scheme without the square-root advantage loss.",

    "abstract": "The Deuring correspondence is a correspondence between supersingular elliptic curves and quaternion orders. Under this correspondence, an isogeny between elliptic curves corresponds to a quaternion ideal. This correspondence plays an important role in isogeny-based cryptography and several algorithms to compute an isogeny corresponding to a quaternion ideal (ideal-to-isogeny algorithms) have been proposed. In particular, SQIsign is a signature scheme based on the Deuring correspondence and uses an ideal-to-isogeny algorithm. In this paper, we propose a novel ideal-to-isogeny algorithm using isogenies of dimension $2$. Our algorithm is based on Kani's reducibility theorem, which gives a connection between isogenies of dimension $1$ and $2$. By using the characteristic $p$ of the base field of the form $2^fg - 1$ for a small odd integer $g$, our algorithm works by only $2$-isogenies and $(2, 2)$-isogenies in the operations in $\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$. We apply our algorithm to SQIsign and compare the efficiency of the new algorithm with the existing one. Our analysis shows that the key generation and the signing in our algorithm are at least twice as fast as those in the existing algorithm at the NIST security level 1. This advantage becomes more significant at higher security levels. In addition, our algorithm also improves the efficiency of the verification in SQIsign.",

    "abstract": "Shaped prime moduli are often considered for use in elliptic curve and isogeny-based cryptography to allow for faster modular reduction. Here we focus on the most common choices for shaped primes that have been suggested, that is pseudo-Mersenne, generalized Mersenne and Montgomery-friendly primes. We consider how best to to exploit these shapes for maximum efficiency, and  provide an open source tool to automatically generate, test and time working high-level language finite-field code. Next we consider the advantage to be gained from implementations that are written in assembly language and which exploit special instructions, SIMD hardware if present, and the particularities of the algorithm being implemented.",

    "abstract": "A private information retrieval (PIR) protocol allows a client to fetch any entry from single or multiple servers who hold a public database (of size $n$) while ensuring no server learns any information about the client's query. Initial works on PIR were focused on reducing the communication complexity of PIR schemes. However, standard PIR protocols are often impractical to use in applications involving large databases, due to its inherent large server-side computation complexity, that's at least linear in the database size.  Hence, a line of research has  focused on considering alternative PIR models that can achieve improved server complexity. \r\n    \r\n    The model of private information retrieval with client prepossessing has received a lot of interest beginning with the work due to Corrigan-Gibbs and Kogan (Eurocrypt 2020). In this model, the client interacts with two servers in an offline phase and it stores a local state, which it uses in the online phase to perform PIR queries. Constructions in this model achieve online client/server computation and bandwidth that's sublinear in the database size, at the cost of a one-time expensive offline phase. Till date all known constructions in this model are based on symmetric key primitives or on stronger public key assumptions like Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) and Learning with Error (LWE). This work initiates the study of unconditional PIR with client prepossessing - where we avoid using any cryptographic assumptions. We present a new  PIR protocol for $2t$ servers (where $t \\in [2,\\log_2n/2]$) with threshold 1, where client and server online computation is $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ (the $\\widetilde{O}(.)$ notation hides $\\textsf{poly}\\log$ factors) - matching the computation costs of other works based on cryptographic assumptions. The client storage and online communication complexity are  $\\widetilde{O}(n^{0.5+1/2t})$ and $\\widetilde{O}(n^{1/2})$ respectively. Compared to previous works our PIR with client preprocessing protocol also has a very concretely efficient client/server online computation phase - which is dominated by xor operations, compared to cryptographic operations that are orders of magnitude slower. As a building block for our construction, we  introduce a new information-theoretic primitive called \\textit{privately multi-puncturable random set }(\\pprs), which might be of independent interest. This new primitive can be viewed as as a generalization of privately puncturable pseudo-random set, which is the key cryptographic building block used in previous works on PIR with client preprocessing.",

    "abstract": "A sequence of recent works, concluding with Mu et al. (Eurocrypt, 2024) has shown that every problem $\\Pi$ admitting a non-interactive statistical zero-knowledge proof (NISZK) has an efficient zero-knowledge batch verification protocol. Namely, an NISZK protocol for proving that $x_1,\\dots,x_k \\in \\Pi$ with communication that only scales poly-logarithmically with $k$. A caveat of this line of work is that the prover runs in exponential-time, whereas for NP problems it is natural to hope to obtain a doubly-efficient proof - that is, a prover that runs in polynomial-time given the $k$ NP witnesses.\r\n\r\n    In this work we show that every problem in $NISZK \\cap UP$ has a doubly-efficient interactive statistical zero-knowledge proof with communication $poly(n,\\log(k))$ and $poly(\\log(k),\\log(n))$ rounds. The prover runs in time $poly(n,k)$ given access to the $k$ UP witnesses. Here $n$ denotes the length of each individual input, and UP is the subclass of NP relations in which YES instances have unique witnesses.\r\n\r\n    This result yields doubly-efficient statistical zero-knowledge batch verification protocols for a variety of concrete and central cryptographic problems from the literature.",

Combining quantum algorithms with classical cryptographic analysis methods, such as differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis, has the potential to reduce complexity. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present a quantum differential finding circuit for differential cryptanalysis. In our quantum circuit, both plaintext and input difference are in a superposition state. Actually, while our method cannot achieve a direct speedup with quantum computing, it offers a different perspective by relying on quantum probability in a superposition state. \r\n\r\nFor the quantum simulation, given the limited number of qubits, we simulate our quantum circuit by implementing the Toy-ASCON quantum circuit.",

In our scheme, the blockchain is used for double-spend protection only, while the authorisation of token transfers is performed off-chain. Due to the universality of our approach, it works in almost all blockchain settings. It can be implemented immediately on UTXO blockchains such as Bitcoin without modification, and on account-based blockchains such as Ethereum by introducing a smart contract that mimics the properties of a UTXO. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of an NFT that is issued on Bitcoin, transferred to Ethereum, and then transferred back to Bitcoin. Our new approach means that users no longer need to be locked into one blockchain when issuing and transferring tokens.",

    "abstract": "It is well-known that a system of equations becomes easier to solve when it is overdefined. In this work, we study how to overdefine the system of equations to describe the arithmetic oriented (AO) ciphers Friday, Vision, and RAIN, as well as a special system of quadratic equations over $\\mathbb F_{2^{\\ell}}$ used in the post-quantum signature scheme Biscuit. Our method is inspired by Courtois-Pieprzyk's and Murphy-Robshaw's methods to model AES with overdefined systems of quadratic equations over $\\mathbb F_2$ and $\\mathbb F_{2^8}$, respectively. However, our method is more refined and much simplified compared with Murphy-Robshaw's method, since it can take full advantage of the low-degree $\\mathbb F_2$-linearized affine polynomials used in Friday and Vision, and the overdefined system of equations over $\\mathbb F_{2^{\\ell}}$ can be described in a clean way with our method. For RAIN, we instead consider quadratic Boolean equations rather than equations over large finite fields $\\mathbb F_{2^{\\ell}}$. Specifically, we demonstrate that the special structure of RAIN allows us to set up much more linearly independent quadratic Boolean equations than those obtained only with Courtois-Pieprzyk's method. Moreover, we further demonstrate that the underlying key-recovery problem in Biscuit (NIST PQC Round 1 Additional Signatures) can also be described by solving a much overdefined system of quadratic equations over $\\mathbb F_{2^{\\ell}}$. On the downside, the constructed systems of quadratic equations for these ciphers cannot be viewed as semi-regular, which makes it challenging to upper bound the complexity of the Gr\u00f6bner basis attack. However, such a new modelling method can significantly improve the lower bound of the complexity of the Gr\u00f6bner basis attacks on these ciphers, i.e., we view the complexity of solving a random system of quadratic equations of the same scale as the lower bound. How to better estimate the upper and lower bounds of the Gr\u00f6bner basis attacks on these ciphers based on our modelling method is left as an open problem.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new attack against search-LWE instances with a small secret key. The method consists of lifting the public key to $\\mathbb Z$ and finding a good Diophantine approximation of the public key divided by the modulus $a$. This is done using lattice reduction algorithms. The lattice considered, and the approximation quality needed is similar to known decision-LWE attacks for small keys. However, we do not require an in-depth analysis of the reduction algorithm (any reduction algorithm giving small enough vectors is enough for us), and our method solves the search problem directly, which is harder than the decision problem.",

    "abstract": "Circuit Private Set Intersection (Circuit-PSI) allows two parties to compute any functionality $f$ on items in the intersection of their input sets without revealing any information about the intersection set. It is a well-known variant of PSI and has numerous practical applications. However, existing circuit-PSI protocols only provide security against \\textit{semi-honest} adversaries. One straightforward solution is to extend a pure garbled-circuit-based PSI (NDSS'12) to a maliciously secure circuit-PSI, but it will result in non-concrete complexity. Another is converting state-of-the-art semi-honest circuit-PSI protocols (EUROCRYPT'21; PoPETS'22) to be secure in the malicious setting. However, it will come across \\textit{the consistency issue} since parties can not guarantee the inputs of functionality $f$ stay unchanged as obtained from the last step.\r\n\r\nThis paper addresses the aforementioned issue by introducing the first maliciously secure circuit-PSI protocol. The central building block named Distributed Dual-key Oblivious PRF (DDOPRF), provides an oblivious evaluation of secret-shared inputs with dual keys. Additionally, we ensure the compatibility of DDOPRF with SPDZ, enhancing the versatility of our circuit-PSI protocol. Notably, our construction allows us to guarantee fairness within circuit-PSI effortlessly. Importantly, our circuit-PSI protocol also achieves online linear computation and communication complexities.",

    "abstract": "Ring signatures allow members of a group (called \"ring\") to sign a message anonymously within the group, which is chosen ad hoc at the time of signing (the members do not need to have interacted before). In this paper, we propose a physical version of ring signatures. Our signature is based on one-out-of-many signatures, a method used in many real cryptographic ring signatures. It consists of boxes containing coins locked with padlocks that can only be opened by a particular group member. To sign a message, a group member shakes the boxes of the other members of the group so that the coins are in a random state (\"heads\" or \"tails\", corresponding to bits $0$ and $1$), and opens their box to arrange the coins so that the exclusive \"or\" of the coins corresponds to the bits of the message they wish to sign. We present a prototype that can be used with coins, or with dice for messages encoded in larger (non-binary) alphabets. We suggest that this system can be used to explain ring signatures to the general public in a fun way. Finally, we propose a semi-formal analysis of the security of our signature based on real cryptographic security proofs.",

    "abstract": "The Rasta design strategy allows building low-round ciphers due to its efficient prevention of statistical attacks and algebraic attacks by randomizing the cipher, which makes it especially suitable for hybrid homomorphic encryption (HHE), also known as transciphering. Such randomization is obtained by pseudorandomly sampling new invertible matrices for each round of each new cipher evaluation. However, naively sampling a random invertible matrix for each round significantly impacts the plain evaluation runtime, though it does not impact the homomorphic evaluation cost. To address this issue, Dasta was proposed at ToSC 2020 to reduce the cost of generating the random matrices. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we address this problem from a different perspective: How far can the randomness in Rasta-like designs be reduced in order to minimize the plain evaluation runtime without sacrificing the security? To answer this question, we carefully studied the main threats to Rasta-like ciphers and the role of random matrices in ensuring security. We apply our results to the recently proposed cipher $\\text{PASTA}$, proposing a modified version called $\\text{PASTA}_\\text{v2}$ instantiated with one initial random matrix and fixed linear layers - obtained by combining two MDS matrices with the Kronecker product - for the other rounds.\r\n\r\nCompared with $\\text{PASTA}$, the state-of-the-art cipher for BGV- and BFV-style HHE, our evaluation shows that $\\text{PASTA}_\\text{v2}$ is up to 100% faster in plain while having the same homomorphic runtime in the SEAL homomorphic encryption library and up to 30% faster evaluation time in HElib, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The BUFF transform, due to Cremers et al. (S&P'21), is a generic transformation for digital signature scheme, with the purpose of obtaining additional security guarantees beyond unforgeability: exclusive ownership, message-bound signatures, and non-resignability. Non-resignability (which essentially challenges an adversary to re-sign an unknown message for which it only obtains the signature) turned out to be a delicate matter, as recently Don et al. (CRYPTO'24) showed that the initial definition is essentially unachievable; in particular, it is not achieved by the BUFF transform. This led to the introduction of new, weakened versions of non-resignability, which are (potentially) achievable. In particular, it was shown that a salted variant of the BUFF transform does achieves some weakened version of non-resignability. However, the salting requires additional randomness and leads to slightly larger signatures. Whether the original BUFF transform also achieves some meaningful notion of non-resignability remained a natural open question.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we answer this question in the affirmative. We show that the BUFF transform satisfies the (almost) strongest notions of non-resignability one can hope for, facing the known impossibility results. Our results cover both the statistical and the computational case, and both the classical and the quantum setting. At the core of our analysis lies a new security game for random oracles that we call Hide-and-Seek. While seemingly innocent at first glance, it turns out to be surprisingly challenging to rigorously analyze.",

    "abstract": "Keeping decrypting parties accountable in public key encryption is notoriously hard since the secret key owner can decrypt any arbitrary ciphertext. Threshold encryption aims to solve this issue by distributing the power to decrypt among a set of parties, who must interact via a decryption protocol. However, such parties can employ cryptographic tools such as Multiparty Computation (MPC) to decrypt arbitrary ciphertexts without being detected. We introduce the notion of (threshold) encryption with Self-Incriminating Proofs, where parties must produce a self-incriminating proof of decryption when decrypting every ciphertext. In the standard public key encryption case, the adversary could destroy these proofs, so we strengthen our notion to guarantee that the proofs are published when decryption succeeds. This creates a decryption audit trail, which is useful in scenarios where decryption power is held by a single trusted party (e.g., a Trusted Execution Environment) who must be kept accountable. In the threshold case, we ensure that at least one of the parties who execute the decryption protocol will learn a self-incriminating proof, even if they employ advanced tools such as MPC. The fact that a party learns the proof and may leak it at any moment functions as a deterrent for parties who do not wish to be identified as malicious decryptors (e.g., a commercial operator of a service based on threshold encryption). We investigate the (im)possibility and applications of our notions while providing matching constructions under appropriate assumptions. In the threshold case, we build on recent results on Individual Cryptography (CRYPTO 2023).",

Our result follows from a very broad, meta-reduction-based impossibility result on random self-reducible relations with efficiently re-randomizable witnesses. The techniques that we develop allow, for the first time, to provide impossibility results for very weak security notions where the challenger outputs fresh challenge statements at the end of the security game. This can be used to finally tackle encryption-type definitions that have remained elusive in the past. We show that our results have broad applicability by casting several known cryptographic setups as instances of random self-reducible and re-randomizable relations. These setups include general semi-homomorphic PKE and the large class of certified homomorphic one-way bijections. As a result, we also obtain new impossibility results for the IND-CCA1 security of the PKEs of Paillier and Damg \u030aard\u2013Jurik, and many one-more inversion assumptions like the one-more DLOG or the one-more RSA assumption.",

    "abstract": "An important proof technique in the random oracle model involves reprogramming it on hard to predict inputs and arguing that an attacker cannot detect that this occurred. In the quantum setting, a particularly challenging version of this considers adaptive reprogramming wherein the points to be reprogrammed (or output values they should be programmed to) are dependent on choices made by the adversary. Frameworks for analyzing adaptive reprogramming were given by, e.g., by Unruh (CRYPTO 2014), Grilo-H\u00f6velmanns-H\u00fclsing-Majenz (ASIACRYPT 2021), and Pan-Zeng (PKC 2024).\r\n\r\nWe show, counterintuitively, that these adaptive results follow directly from the non-adaptive one-way to hiding theorem of Ambainis-Hamburg-Unruh (CRYPTO 2019). These implications contradict beliefs (whether stated explicitly or implicitly) that some properties of the adaptive frameworks cannot be provided by the Ambainis-Hamburg-Unruh result.",

    "abstract": "Incompressible encryption (Dziembowski, Crypto'06; Guan, Wichs, Zhandry, Eurocrypt'22) protects from attackers that learn the entire decryption key, but cannot store the full ciphertext. In incompressible encryption, the attacker must try to compress a ciphertext within pre-specified memory bound $S$ before receiving the secret key.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we generalize the notion of incompressibility to functional encryption. In incompressible functional encryption, the adversary can corrupt non-distinguishing keys at any point, but receives the distinguishing keys only after compressing the ciphertext to within $S$ bits. An important efficiency measure for incompressible encryption is the ciphertext-rate ( i.e., $\\mathsf{rate} = \\frac{|m|}{|\\mathsf{ct}|}$). We give many new results for incompressible functional encryption for circuits, from minimal assumption of (non-incompressible) functional encryption, with \r\n\r\n1. $\\mathsf{ct}$-rate-$\\frac{1}{2}$ and short secret keys,\r\n2. $\\mathsf{ct}$-rate-$1$ and large secret keys.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, we also give a new incompressible attribute-based encryption for circuits from standard assumptions, with $\\mathsf{ct}$-rate-$\\frac{1}{2}$ and short secret keys. Our results achieve optimal efficiency, as incompressible attribute-based/functional encryption with $\\mathsf{ct}$-rate-$1$ as well as short secret keys has strong barriers for provable security from standard assumptions. Moreover, our assumptions are minimal as incompressible attribute-based/functional encryption are strictly stronger than their non-incompressible counterparts.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new cryptographic primitive called symmetric signcryption, which differs from traditional signcryption because the sender and recipient share a secret key. We prove that a natural composition of symmetric encryption and signatures achieves strong notions of security against attackers that can learn and control many keys. We then identify that the core encryption algorithm of the Keybase encrypted messaging protocol can be modeled as a symmetric signcryption scheme. We prove the security of this algorithm, though our proof requires assuming non-standard, brittle security properties of the underlying primitives.",

We suggest a generalization of the map $\\chi$ which we call generalized $\\chi$-maps. We show that these maps form an Abelian group which is isomorphic to the group of units in $\\mathbb{F}_2[X]/(X^{(n+1)/2})$. Using this isomorphism we easily obtain closed-form expressions for iterates  of $\\chi$ and explain their properties.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we study the S-box known as Chi or \\chi initially proposed by Daemen in 1995 and very widely used ever since in Keccak, Ascon, and many other. This type of ciphers is typically analyzed [in recent research] in terms of subspace trail attacks [TeDi19] and vector space invariants. An interesting question is then, when different spaces are mapped to each other by translations with a constant. \r\nIn this paper we relax this fundamental question and we consider arbitrary sets of points and their translations.  We generalize previous S-box partial linearization results on Keccak and Ascon from Eurocrypt 2017.  We basically introduce new ways to linearize the Ascon S-box to the maximum possible extent. On this basis we show further remarkable properties and some surprising connections between [simultaneous] linear and [prominent] differential properties. We exhibit a new family of  maximum size and optimal approximation properties with 11 points, beyond the maximum size of any set in the DDT table. \r\nWe prove a theorem which guarantees that this type of properties are stable by arbitrary input-side translations which holds for all quadratic permutations. All this will be placed in the context of previous work on classification of 5-bit quadratic permutations.",

    "abstract": "Recent improvements to garbled circuits are mainly focused on reducing their size.\r\nThe state-of-the-art construction of Rosulek and Roy~(Crypto~2021) requires $1.5\\kappa$ bits for garbling AND gates in the free-XOR setting.\r\nThis is below the previously proven lower bound $2\\kappa$ in the linear garbling model of Zahur, Rosulek, and Evans~(Eurocrypt~2015).\r\n\r\nRecently, Ashur, Hazay, and Satish~(eprint 2024/389) proposed a scheme that requires $4/3\\kappa + O(1)$ bits for garbling AND gates.\r\nPrecisely they extended the idea of \\emph{slicing} introduced by Rosulek and Roy to garble 3-input gates of the form $g(u,v,w) := u(v+w)$.\r\nBy setting $w = 0$, it can be used to garble AND gates with the improved communication costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, in this paper, we observe that the scheme proposed by Ashur, Hazy, and Satish leaks information on the permute bits,\r\nthereby allowing the evaluator to reveal information on the private inputs.\r\nTo be precise, we show that in their garbling scheme, the evaluator can compute the bits $\\alpha$ and $\\beta + \\gamma$,\r\nwhere $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$ are the private permute bits of the input labels $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively.",

    "abstract": "NTRU-like cryptosystems are among the most studied lattice-based post-quantum candidates. While most NTRU proposals have been introduced over a commutative ring of quotient polynomials, other rings can be used. Noncommutative algebra has been endorsed as a direction to build new variants of NTRU a long time ago. The first attempt to construct a noncommutative variant was due to Hoffstein and Silverman motivated by more resistance to lattice attack. The scheme has been built over the group ring of a dihedral group. However, their design differed from standard NTRU and soon was found vulnerable to algebraic attacks. In this work, we revive the group ring NTRU over the dihedral group as an instance of the GR-NTRU framework.\r\nUnlike many proposals of noncommutative variants in the literature, our work focuses on putting the scheme into practice. We clear all the aspects that make our scheme implementable by proposing an efficient inversion algorithm over the new setting of the noncommutative ring, describing the decryption failure model, and analyzing the lattice associated with our instantiation. Finally, we discuss the best-known attacks against our scheme and provide an implementation targeting 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit levels of security as proof of its practicality.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the fault tolerance of Byzantine Agreement protocols is an important question in distributed computing. While the setting of Byzantine faults has been thoroughly explored in the literature, the (arguably more realistic) omission fault setting is far less studied. In this paper, we revisit the recent work of Loss and Stern who gave the first protocol in the mixed fault model tolerating $t$ Byzantine faults, $s$ send faults, and $r$ receive faults, when $2t+r+s<n$ and omission faults do not overlap. We observe that their protocol makes no guarantees when omission faults can overlap, i.e., when parties can simultaneously have send and receive faults. We give the first protocol that overcomes this limitation and tolerates the same number of potentially overlapping faults. We then study, for the first time, the total omission setting where all parties can become omission faulty. This setting is motivated by real-world scenarios where every party may experience connectivity issues from time to time, yet agreement should still hold for the parties who manage to output values. We show the first agreement protocol in this setting with parameters $s<n$ and $s+r=n$. On the other hand, we prove that there is no consensus protocol for the total omission setting which tolerates even a single overlapping omission fault, i.e., where $s+r=n+1$ and $s>2$, or a broadcast protocol for $s+r=n$ and $s>1$ even without overlapping faults.",

    "abstract": "Arma is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus system designed to\r\nachieve horizontal scalability across all hardware resources: network\r\nbandwidth, CPU, and disk I/O. As opposed to preceding BFT protocols, Arma separates the dissemination and validation of client transactions from the consensus process, restricting the latter to totally ordering only metadata of batches of transactions. This separation enables each party to distribute compute and storage resources for transaction validation, dissemination and disk I/O among multiple machines, resulting in horizontal scalability.\r\nAdditionally, Arma ensures censorship resistance by imposing a maximum\r\ntime limit on the inclusion of client transactions. We built and evaluated two Arma prototypes. The first is an independent system handling over 200,000 transactions per second, the second integrated into Hyperledger Fabric, speeding its consensus by an order of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "This paper deals with reducing the secret key computation time of small scale variants of the AES cipher using algebraic cryptanalysis, which is accelerated by data mining methods. This work is based on the known plaintext attack and aims to speed up the calculation of the secret key by processing the polynomial equations extracted from plaintext-ciphertext pairs. Specifically, we propose to transform the overdefined system of polynomial equations over GF(2) into a new system so that the computation of the Gr\u00f6bner basis using the F4 algorithm takes less time than in the case of the original system. The main idea is to group similar polynomials into clusters, and for each cluster, sum the two most similar polynomials, resulting in simpler polynomials. We compare different data mining techniques for finding similar polynomials, such as clustering or locality-sensitive hashing (LSH). Experimental results show that using the LSH technique, we get a system of equations for which we can calculate the Gr\u00f6bner basis the fastest compared to the other methods that we consider in this work. Experimental results also show that the time to calculate the Gr\u00f6bner basis for the transformed system of equations is significantly reduced compared to the case when the Gr\u00f6bner basis was calculated from the original non-transformed system. This paper demonstrates that reducing an overdefined system of equations reduces the computation time for finding a secret key.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the robustness of Kyber, the Learning With Errors (LWE)-based Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) chosen for standardization by NIST, against key mismatch attacks. We demonstrate that Kyber's security levels can be compromised with a few mismatch queries by striking a balance between the parallelization level and the cost of lattice reduction for post-processing. This highlights the imperative need to strictly prohibit key reuse in CPA-secure Kyber.\r\n\r\nWe further propose an adaptive method to enhance parallel mismatch\r\nattacks, initially proposed by Shao et al. at AsiaCCS 2024, thereby significantly reducing query complexity. This method combines the adaptive attack with post-processing via lattice reduction to retrieve the final secret key entries. Our method proves its efficacy by reducing query complexity by 14.6 % for Kyber512 and 7.5 % for Kyber768/Kyber1024.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this approach has the potential to substantially improve\r\nmulti-value Plaintext-Checking (PC) oracle-based side-channel attacks against the CCA-secure version of Kyber KEM.",

    "abstract": "Traceable threshold secret sharing schemes, introduced by Goyal, Song and Srinivasan (CRYPTO'21), allow to provably trace leaked shares to the parties that leaked them. The authors give the first definition and construction of traceable secret sharing schemes. However, the size of the shares in their construction are quadratic in the size of the secret. Boneh, Partap and Rotem (CRYPTO'24) recently proposed a new definition of traceable secret sharing and the first practical constructions. In their definition, one considers a reconstruction box $R$ that contains $f$ leaked shares and, on input $t-f$ additional shares, outputs the secret $s$. A scheme is traceable if one can find out the leaked shares inside the box $R$ by only getting black-box access to $R$. Boneh, Partap and Rotem give constructions from Shamir's secret sharing and Blakely's secret sharing. The constructions are efficient as the size of the secret shares is only twice the size of the secret.\r\n\r\nIn this work we present the first traceable secret sharing scheme based on the Chinese remainder theorem. This was stated as an open problem by Boneh, Partap and Rotem, as it gives rise to traceable secret sharing with weighted threshold access structures. The scheme is based on Mignotte's secret sharing and increases the size of the shares of the standard Mignotte secret sharing scheme by a factor of $2$.",

    "abstract": "In a recent Eurocrypt'24 paper, Manulis and Nguyen have proposed a new CCA security notion, vCCA, and associated construction blueprints to leverage both CPA-secure and correct FHE beyond the CCA1 security barrier. However, because their approach is only valid under the correctness assumption, it leaves a large part of the FHE spectrum uncovered as many FHE schemes used in practice turn out to be approximate and, as such, do not satisfy the correctness assumption. In this paper, we improve their work by defining and investigating a variant of their security notion which is suitable for a more general case where approximate FHE are included. As the passive security of approximate FHE schemes is more appropriately captured by CPAD rather than CPA security, we start from the former notion to define our vCCAD new security notion. Although, we show that vCCA and vCCAD are equivalent when the correctness assumption holds, we establish that vCCAD security is strictly stronger than vCCA security in the general case. In doing so, we interestingly establish several new separation results between variants of CPAD security of increasing strength. This allows us to clarify the relationship between vCCA security and CPAD security, and to reveal that the security notions landscape is much simpler for correct FHE than when approximate ones are included --- in which case, for example, we establish that multiple challenges security notions are strictly stronger than single-challenge ones for both CPAD and vCCAD security. Lastly, we also give concrete construction blueprints, showing how to leverage some of the blueprints proposed by Manulis and Nguyen to achieve vCCAD security. As a result, vCCAD security is the strongest CCA security notion so far known to be achievable by both correct and approximate FHE schemes.",

    "abstract": "We explain how to extend the Bitcoin backbone model of Garay et al. (Eurocrypt, 2015) to accommodate for redactable blockchains. Our extension captures fluid blockchain-based databases (with mutability requirements) and compliance with existing legislation, such as the GDPR right to be forgotten, or the need to erase offending data from nodes\u2019 databases that would otherwise provoke legal shutdowns. Our redactable backbone protocol retains the essential properties of blockchains. Leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, old data can be erased without requiring trusted third parties or heuristics about past chain validation. Our solution can be implemented on Bitcoin immediately without hard-forks, and it is scalable. It allows the redaction of data from UTXOs or unconfirmed transactions that have not yet flooded the network, while guaranteeing invariance of the Bitcoin state. Thus, offending data does not need to persist in the system, not even temporarily.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces homomorphic secret sharing (HSS) with succinct share size. In HSS, private inputs are shared between parties, who can then homomorphically evaluate a function on their shares, obtaining a share of the function output. In succinct HSS, a portion of the inputs can be distributed using shares whose size is sublinear in the number of such inputs. The parties can then locally evaluate a function $f$ on the shares, with the restriction that $f$ must be linear in the succinctly shared inputs.\r\n\r\nWe construct succinct, two-party HSS for branching programs, based on either the decisional composite residuosity assumption, a DDH-like assumption in class groups, or learning with errors with a superpolynomial modulus-to-noise ratio. We then give several applications of succinct HSS, which were only previously known using fully homomorphic encryption, or stronger tools:\r\n\r\n- Succinct vector oblivious linear evaluation (VOLE): Two parties can obtain secret shares of a long, arbitrary vector $\\vec x$, multiplied by a scalar $\\Delta$, with communication sublinear in the size of the vector.\r\n- Batch, multi-party distributed point functions: A protocol for distributing a batch of secret, random point functions among $N$ parties, for any polynomial $N$, with communication sublinear in the number of DPFs.\r\n- Sublinear MPC for any number of parties: Two new constructions of MPC with sublinear communication complexity, with $N$ parties for any polynomial $N$: (1) For general layered Boolean circuits of size $s$, with communication $O(N s/\\log\\log s)$, and (2) For layered, sufficiently wide Boolean circuits, with communication $O(N s/\\log s)$.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a new probability function parameter in the instantiations of the Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson with Fiat-Shamir and unbalanced challenges used in ALTEQ, a recent NIST PQC candidate in the call for additional signatures. This probability set at 100% does not bring any changes in the scheme, but modifies the public challenge generation process when below 100%, by injecting potential rejections in otherwise completely valid inputs.\r\nFrom a theoretical point of view, this does not improve the asymptotical hardness of the scheme and negatively affects the efficiency of the signatory, and might itself seem trivial. However, from a practical point of view, implementation-wise and performance-wise, this triviality allows an extra degree of freedom in optimizing parameters, as the heuristic security level is also increased against forgers: previously valid combinations now can be deemed invalid. This allows us to make trade-offs to reduce the computational load in verifiers, accelerating verifications, marginally reduce the signature size, at the cost of making signatures slower and unlikely to be constant-time.\r\nIn particular, this extra degree of freedom allows to make implementation choices that enable smoother and faster executions of the aforementioned protocols, especially in the context of parallelization using vectorized instructions. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our proposal to ALTEQ for other options, when slowing down the signing process is not an issue: significantly smaller signatures but longer verifications, or lower public key sizes.\r\nThe ideas presented apply to any primitive, and can be used beyond ALTEQ.",

    "abstract": "Interactive Oracle Proofs (IOPs) allow a probabilistic verifier interacting with a prover to verify the validity of an NP statement while reading only few bits from the prover messages. IOPs generalize standard Probabilistically-Checkable Proofs (PCPs) to the interactive setting, and in the few years since their introduction have already exhibited major improvements in main parameters of interest (such as the proof length and prover and verifier running times), which in turn led to significant improvements in constructions of succinct arguments. Zero-Knowledge (ZK) IOPs additionally guarantee that the view of any query-bounded (possibly malicious) verifier can be efficiently simulated. ZK-IOPs are the main building block of succinct ZK arguments which use the underlying cryptographic object (e.g., a collision-resistant hash function) as a black box.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we construct the first ZK-IOPs approaching the witness length for a natural NP problem. More specifically, we design constant-query and constant-round IOPs for 3SAT in which the total communication is $(1+\\gamma)m$, where $m$ is the number of variables and $\\gamma>0$ is an arbitrarily small constant, and ZK holds against verifiers querying $m^\\beta$ bits from the prover's messages, for a constant $\\beta>0$. This gives a ZK variant of a recent result of Ron-Zewi and Rothblum (FOCS `20), who construct (non-ZK) IOPs approaching the witness length for a large class of NP languages. Previous constructions of ZK-IOPs incurred an (unspecified) large constant multiplicative overhead in the proof length, even when restricting to ZK against the honest verifier.\r\n\r\nWe obtain our ZK-IOPs by improving the two main building blocks underlying most ZK-IOP constructions, namely ZK codes and ZK-IOPs for sumcheck. More specifically, we give the first ZK-IOPs for sumcheck that achieve both sublinear communication for sumchecking a general tensor code, and a ZK guarantee. We also show a strong ZK preservation property for tensors of ZK codes, which extends a recent result of Bootle, Chiesa, and Liu (EC `22). Given the central role of these objects in designing ZK-IOPs, these results might be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present three types of variations of the ALTEQ cryptosystem, a recent submission to the NIST's additional call for signatures. We name these Dangerous Variations of ALTEQ (DVA), as there is always a certain danger in stepping out of usual constructions, although we attempt to maintain heuristic security.\r\nFirst, we present DVA-GG (Graph Generalization), that can be seen as a more abstract point-of-view on the operations done in ALTEQ and encourages more research on the algebraic variants. In particular, we show this approach can lead to a patch counter to Beullens' recent seed collision attack on ALTEQ that only depends on the primitive, and showcase some fancy usages of the primitive for experimental protocols.\r\nSecond, we present DVA-PC (Precomputations) which is ``likely'' as secure as ALTEQ in the random oracle model, and allow to drastically reduce the intermediate memory requirements within both the signature and verification process through an easily parallelizable extra operation. In particular, this facilitates precomputation variants with online phases that only depends on the complexity of basic matrix operations. We can then choose between either a tiny offline memory per signature, or get one of the fastest online signing speed for post-quantum cryptography.\r\nThird, we present DVA-DM (Distinct Matrices), some cryptanalytic targets that deviates from ALTEQ's original algebraic structure. Those structures can serve as plain computational acceleration or just compress data sizes,\r\nand provide good options to motivate the study of specialized\r\ncryptanalysis for ALTEQ: if those are safe, then ALTEQ gain safe variants, and otherwise, we gain further understanding of the problems.\r\nIn particular, the ideas can be applied beyond ALTEQ and beyond, and hopefully extend to MEDS, LESS, and group-action-based cryptography.",

    "abstract": "The universal composability (UC) model provides strong security guarantees for protocols used in arbitrary contexts. While these guarantees are highly desirable, in practice, schemes with a standalone proof of security, such as the Groth16 proof system, are preferred. This is because UC security typically comes with undesirable overhead, sometimes making UC-secure schemes significantly less efficient than their standalone counterparts. We establish the UC security of Groth16 without any significant overhead. In the spirit of global random oracles, we design a global (restricted) observable generic group functionality that models a natural notion of observability: computations that trace back to group elements derived from generators of other sessions are observable. This notion turns out to be surprisingly subtle to formalize. We provide a general framework for proving protocols secure in the presence of global generic groups, which we then apply to Groth16.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new efficient stand-alone MAC construct based on processing using the FSM part of the stream cipher family SNOW, which in turn uses the AES round function. It offers a combination of very high speed in software and hardware with a truncatable tag. Three concrete versions of SMAC are proposed with different security levels, although other use cases are also possible. For example, SMAC can be combined with an external ciphering engine in AEAD mode. Every design choice is justified and supported by the results of our analysis and simulations. We also provide an aggregated mode version SMAC-1$\\times n$ whose performance in software reaches up to 925 Gbps (around 0.038 cpb) for long messages in a single thread. A novelty of the proposal is that it meets future performance requirements but is still not directly vulnerable to attacks using repeated nonce when the tag size is short, as is the case for other very fast MACs (MACs based on polynomial hashing). This can be an important aspect in practical applications.",

    "abstract": "We present a general framework for constructing attribute-based encryption (ABE) schemes for arbitrary function class based on lattices from two ingredients, i)\u00a0a noisy linear secret sharing scheme for the class and ii)\u00a0a new type of inner-product functional encryption (IPFE) scheme, termed *evasive* IPFE, which we introduce in this work.  We propose lattice-based evasive IPFE schemes and establish their security under simple conditions based on variants of evasive learning with errors (LWE) assumption recently proposed by Wee\u00a0[EUROCRYPT\u00a0\u201922] and Tsabary\u00a0[CRYPTO\u00a0\u201922].\r\n\r\nOur general framework is modular and conceptually simple, reducing the task of constructing ABE to that of constructing noisy linear secret sharing schemes, a more lightweight primitive.  The versatility of our framework is demonstrated by three new ABE schemes based on variants of the evasive LWE assumption.\r\n\r\n- We obtain two ciphertext-policy ABE schemes for all polynomial-size circuits with a predetermined depth bound.  One of these schemes has *succinct* ciphertexts and secret keys, of size polynomial in the depth bound, rather than the circuit size.  This eliminates the need for tensor LWE, another new assumption, from the previous state-of-the-art construction by Wee\u00a0[EUROCRYPT\u00a0\u201922].\r\n\r\n- We develop ciphertext-policy and key-policy ABE schemes for deterministic finite automata (DFA) and logspace Turing machines ($\\mathsf{L}$).  They are the first lattice-based public-key ABE schemes supporting uniform models of computation.  Previous lattice-based schemes for uniform computation were limited to the secret-key setting or offered only weaker security against bounded collusion.\r\n\r\nLastly, the new primitive of evasive IPFE serves as the lattice-based counterpart of pairing-based IPFE, enabling the application of techniques developed in pairing-based ABE constructions to lattice-based constructions.  We believe it is of independent interest and may find other applications.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present two early stopping Byzantine agreement protocols in the authenticated setting against a corrupt minority $t < n/2$, where $t$ represents the maximum number of malicious parties. Early stopping protocols ensure termination within a number of rounds determined solely by the actual number of malicious nodes $f$ present during execution, irrespective of $t$. \r\n\r\nOur first protocol is deterministic and ensures early stopping termination in $ (d+5) \\cdot (\\lfloor f/d \\rfloor +2)+2$ rounds, where $d$ is a fixed constant. For example, for all $d\\ge 6$, our protocol runs in at most $(1+\\epsilon )\\cdot f$ rounds (where $0<\\epsilon<1$), improving (for large $f$) upon the best previous early stopping deterministic broadcast protocol by Perry and Toueg 1984, which terminates in $min(2f+4,2t+2)$ rounds.  Additionally, our second protocol is randomized, ensuring termination in an expected constant number of rounds and achieving early stopping in $(d+9) \\cdot (\\lfloor f/d \\rfloor +1)+2$ rounds in the worst case. This marks a significant improvement over a similar result by Goldreich and Petrank 1990, which always requires an expected constant number of rounds and $O(t)$ rounds in the worst case, i.e., does not have the early stopping property.",

    "abstract": "A function secret sharing (FSS) scheme ($\\mathsf{gen},\\mathsf{eval}$) for a class of programs $\\mathcal{F}$ allows a dealer to secret share any function $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$, such that each function share hides the function, and the shares can be used to non-interactively compute additive shares of $f(x)$ for any input $x$. All FSS related applications often requires the dealer to generate and share secret sharings for a batch of functions. \r\nWe initiate the study of batched function secret sharing - where the objective is to secret share a set of functions from the class $\\mathcal{F}$ while minimizing the size of the collection of FSS keys. \r\n\r\nWe use standard homomorphic secret sharing (HSS) schemes, variant of the Learning with Parity Noise assumption and the Quadratic Residuosity assumption to construct batched FSS schemes for point functions with single-bit and multi-bit output. Our scheme is asymptotically superior than naively batching state of the art FSS schemes for point functions. Concretely our batch key sizes are smaller by a factor of  $3-80\\times$ as batch size is increased from $2^{13}$ to $2^{19}$. Although our protocol relies on public key operations, it exhibits inefficiency in a LAN setting. However, it demonstrates up to a 120-fold improvement in a WAN setting with slow network bandwidth.\r\n\r\nAs a building block in our protocols, we introduce a new HSS ciphertext compression algorithm, that can decompress a short compressed ciphertext to give low noise ciphertexts of array of input message bits. This primitive might be of independent interest for other HSS related applications.",

    "abstract": "The Learning with Errors (LWE) problem with its variants over structured lattices has been widely exploited in efficient post-quantum cryptosystems. Recently, May suggests the Meet-LWE attack, which poses a significant advancement in the line of work on the Meet-in-the-Middle approach to analyze LWE with ternary secrets. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we generalize and extend the idea of Meet-LWE by introducing ternary trees, which result in diverse representations of the secrets. More precisely, we split the secrets into three pieces with the same dimension and expand them into a ternary tree to leverage the increased representations to improve the overall attack complexity. We also suggest the matching criteria for the approximate matching of three lists via locality sensitive hash function accordingly. We carefully analyze and optimize the time and memory costs of our attack algorithm exploiting ternary trees, and compare them to those of the Meet-LWE attack. With asymptotic and non-asymptotic comparisons, we observe that our attack provides improved estimations for all parameter settings, including those of the practical post-quantum schemes, compared to the Meet-LWE attack. We also evaluate the security of the Round 2 candidates of the KpqC competition which aims to standardize post-quantum public key cryptosystems in the Republic of Korea and report that the estimated complexities for our attack applied to SMAUG-T are lower than the claimed for some of the recommended parameters.",

    "abstract": "Payment channel networks (e.g., the Lightning Network in Bitcoin) constitute one of the most popular scalability solutions for blockchains. Their safety relies on parties being online to detect fraud attempts on-chain and being able to timely react by publishing certain transactions on-chain. However, a cheating party may bribe miners in order to censor those transactions, resulting in loss of funds for the cheated party: these attacks are known in the literature as timelock bribing attacks. In this work, we present the first channel construction that does not require parties to be online and, at the same time, is resistant to timelock bribing attacks.\r\n\r\nWe start by proving for the first time that Lightning channels are secure against timelock bribing attacks in the presence of rational channel parties under the assumption that these parties constantly monitor the mempool and never deplete the channel in one direction. The latter underscores the importance of keeping a coin reserve in each channel as implemented in the Lightning Network, albeit for different reasons. We show, however, that the security of the Lightning Network against Byzantine channel parties does not carry over to a setting in which miners are rational and accept timelock bribes.\r\n\r\nNext, we introduce CRAB, the first Lightning-compatible channel construction that provides security against Byzantine channel parties and rational miners. CRAB leverages miners' incentives to safeguard the channel, thereby also forgoing the unrealistic assumption of channel parties constantly monitoring the mempool.\r\n\r\nFinally, we show how our construction can be refined to eliminate the major assumption behind payment channels, i.e., the need for online participation. To that end, we present Sleepy CRAB the first provably secure channel construction under rational miners that enables participants to go offline indefinitely. We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation of Sleepy CRAB and evaluate its cost in Bitcoin, thereby demonstrating its practicality.",

    "abstract": "We introduce and formally define Multivariate Multi-Polynomial (MMP) commitment, a commitment scheme on multiple multivariate polynomials, and illustrate the concept with an efficient construction, which enjoys constant commitment size and logarithmic proof size. We further enhance our MMP scheme to achieve the zero-knowledge property. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, combined with a novel zero-knowledge range proof for Pedersen subvector commitment, we present a Zero-Knowledge Range Proof (ZKRP) for MMP commitment. \r\n\r\nWe present two sample applications. Firstly, our MMP commitment can be used for efficient aggregation of SNARK based on multivariate polynomial commitments. As a showcase,  we apply MMP commitment to HyperPlonk and refer to this variant of HyperPlonk as aHyperPlonk.  For $k$ instances, each with circuit size $n$, the communication and verification complexity is reduced from $O(k \\cdot  \\log n)$ to $O(\\log k + \\log n)$, while the prover complexity remains the same. Secondly,  we propose a novel zero-knowledge proof for vehicle GPS traces based on  ZKRP for MMP, which allows vehicle owners to prove if a vehicle has/hasn't passed through some location during a specific time interval.",

    "abstract": "Extensible Markup Language (XML) is one of the most popular serialization languages. Since many security protocols are built using XML, it also provides cryptographic functionality. A central framework in this area is the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). This standard is one of the most widely used options for implementing Single Sign-On (SSO), which allows users to authenticate to different service providers using the credentials from a single identity provider. Like all other security protocols currently in use, the security and privacy of XML-based frameworks such as SAML is threatened by the development of increasingly powerful quantum computers. In fact, future attackers with access to scalable quantum computers will be able to break the currently used cryptographic building blocks and thus undermine the security of the SAML SSO to illegally access sensitive private information. Post-quantum cryptography algorithms have been developed to protect against such quantum attackers. While many security protocols have been migrated into the quantum age by using post-quantum cryptography, no such solutions for XML and the security protocols based on it have been developed, let alone tested. We make the following contributions to fill this gap. We have designed post-quantum solutions for the cryptographic building blocks in XML and integrated them into the SAML SSO protocol. We implemented our solutions in the OpenSAML, Apache Santuario, and BouncyCastle libraries and extensively tested their performance for various post-quantum instantiations. As a result, we have created a comprehensive and solid foundation for post-quantum XML and post-quantum SAML SSO migration.",

    "abstract": "Doubly Efficient Private Information Retrieval (DEPIR) pertains to a Private Information Retrieval (PIR) scheme with both near-linear server-side preprocessing time and sublinear query time. Very recently, Lin et al. (STOC '23) devised the first single-server DEPIR scheme from standard assumptions. However, their work left one major question open: can we build a DEPIR scheme in the multi-server setting, without relying on heavy cryptographic machinery?\r\n    \r\nIn this work, we propose the first doubly efficient information-theoretic PIR scheme, in the multi-server setting. For a database of size $N$, our scheme allows servers to answer an infinite number of client queries in $N^{o(1)}$ time, after a single preprocessing phase which takes $N^{1+o(1)}$ time. Our result is only a $N^{o(1)}$ factor from the lower bound proven by Persiano and Yeo (SODA '22) for this setting.\r\n    \r\nIn addition, we devise a second information-theoretic PIR scheme which pushes the state of the art for the setting where the number of servers is more constrained. It achieves equally fast query times as our first scheme above, and a preprocessing time of $N^{2+o(1)}$.",

    "abstract": "The seminal work by Impagliazzo and Rudich (STOC'89) demonstrated the impossibility of constructing classical public key encryption (PKE) from one-way functions (OWF) in a black-box manner. However, the question remains: can quantum PKE (QPKE) be constructed from quantumly secure OWF?\r\n\r\nA recent line of work has shown that it is indeed possible to build QPKE from OWF, but with one caveat --- they rely on quantum public keys, which cannot be authenticated and reused. In this work, we re-examine the possibility of perfect complete QPKE in the quantum random oracle model (QROM), where OWF exists.\r\n\r\nOur first main result: QPKE with classical public keys, secret keys and ciphertext, does not exist in the QROM, if the key generation only makes classical queries.\r\nTherefore, a necessary condition for constructing such QPKE from OWF is to have the key generation classically ``un-simulatable\u2019\u2019. Previous discussions (Austrin~et al. CRYPTO'22) on the impossibility of QPKE from OWF rely on a seemingly strong conjecture. Our work makes a significant step towards a complete and unconditional quantization of Impagliazzo and Rudich\u2019s results.\r\n\r\nOur second main result extends to QPKE with quantum public keys.\r\nThe second main result: QPKE with quantum public keys, classical secret keys and ciphertext, does not exist in the QROM, if the key generation only makes classical queries and the quantum public key is either pure or ``efficiently clonable''.\r\nThe result is tight due to all existing QPKEs constructions. Our result further gives evidence on why existing QPKEs lose reusability.\r\n\r\nTo achieve these results, we use a novel argument based on conditional mutual information and quantum Markov chain by Fawzi and Renner (Communications in Mathematical Physics). We believe the techniques used in the work will find other usefulness in separations in quantum cryptography/complexity.",

    "abstract": "We provide a wide systematic study of proximity proofs with one-sided error for the Hamming weight problem $\\mathsf{Ham}_{\\alpha}$ (the language of bit vectors with Hamming weight at least $\\alpha$), surpassing previously known results for this problem. We demonstrate the usefulness of the one-sided error property in applications: no malicious party can frame an honest prover as cheating by presenting verifier randomness that leads to a rejection.\r\n\r\nWe show proofs of proximity for $\\mathsf{Ham}_{\\alpha}$ with one-sided error and sublinear proof length in three models (MA, PCP, IOP), where stronger models allow for smaller query complexity. For $n$-bit input vectors, highlighting input query complexity, our MA has $O(\\mathrm{log} n)$ query complexity, the PCP makes $O(\\mathrm{loglog} n)$ queries, and the IOP makes a single input query. The prover in all of our applications runs in expected quasi-linear time.  Additionally, we show that any perfectly complete IP of proximity for $\\mathsf{Ham}_{\\alpha}$ with input query complexity $n^{1-\\epsilon}$ has proof length $\\Omega(\\mathrm{log} n)$.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we study PCPs of proximity where the verifier is restricted to making a single input query (SIQ). We show that any SIQ-PCP for $\\mathsf{Ham}_{\\alpha}$ must have a linear proof length, and complement this by presenting a SIQ-PCP with proof length $n+o(n)$.\r\n\r\nAs an application, we provide new methods that transform PCPs (and IOPs) for arbitrary languages with nonzero completeness error into PCPs (and IOPs) that exhibit perfect completeness. These transformations achieve parameters previously unattained.",

    "abstract": "Despite masking being a prevalent protection against passive side-channel attacks, implementing it securely in hardware remains a manual, challenging,  and error-prone process. \r\n\r\nThis paper introduces INDIANA, a comprehensive security verification tool for hardware masking. It provides a hardware verification framework, enabling a complete analysis of simulation-based security in the glitch-extended probing model, with cycle-accurate estimations for leakage probabilities in the random probing model. \r\nNotably, INDIANA is the first framework to analyze arbitrary masked circuits in both models, even at the scale of full SPN cipher rounds (e.g., AES), while delivering exact verification results.\r\n\r\nTo attain precise and extensive verifiability, we introduce a partitionable probing distinguisher that enables rapid verification of probe tuples, outperforming state-of-the-art methods based on statistical independence. Most interestingly, our approach inherently facilitates extensions to the random probing model by leveraging Fast Fourier-Hadamard Transformations (FFTs).\r\n\r\nBenchmark results show that INDIANA competes effectively with leading probing model verification tools, such as maskVerif and VERICA. Notably, INDIANA the first tool that is capable to provide cycle-accurate estimations of random probing leakage probabilities for large-scale masked circuits.",

    "abstract": "We revisit the construction of multiparty non-interactive key-exchange protocols with fine-grained security, which was recently studied in (Afshar et al., Eurocrypt 2023). Their work introduced a 4-party non-interactive key exchange with quadratic hardness, and proved it secure in Shoup's generic group model. This positive result was complemented with a proof that $n$-party non-interactive key exchange with superquadratic security cannot exist in Maurer's generic group model, for any $n\\geq 3$. Because Shoup's model is stronger than Maurer's model, this leaves a gap between the positive and the negative result, and their work left as an open question the goal of closing this gap, and of obtaining fine-grained non-interactive key exchange without relying on idealized models.\r\n\r\n    In this work, we make significant progress on both questions. We obtain two main results:\r\n\r\n A 4-party non-interactive key exchange protocol with quadratic security gap, assuming the existence of exponentially secure injective pseudorandom generators, and the subexponential hardness of the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption. In addition, our scheme is conceptually simpler, and can be generalized to other settings (with more parties or from other assumptions).\r\n\r\nAssuming the existence of non-uniformly secure injective pseudorandom generators with exponential hardness, we further show that our protocol is secure in Maurer's model, albeit with a smaller hardness gap (up to $N^{1.6}$), making progress on filling the gap between the positive and the negative result of (Afshar et al., Eurocrypt 2023). Somewhat intriguingly, proving the security of our scheme in Maurer's idealized model turns out to be significantly harder than proving its security in the standard model.",

    "abstract": "In a recent work, H\u00f6velmanns, H\u00fclsing and Majenz introduced a new security proof for the Fujisaki-Okamoto transform in the quantum-accessible random oracle model (QROM) used in post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms. While having a smaller security loss due to decryption failures present in many constructions, it requires two new security properties of the underlying public-key encryption scheme (PKE).\r\nIn this work, we show that one of the properties, Find Failing Plaintexts - Non Generic (FFP-NG) security, is achievable using a relatively efficient LWE-based PKE that does not have perfect correctness. In particular, we show that LWE reduces to breaking FFP-NG security of the PVW scheme, when all LWE errors are discrete Gaussian distributed. The reduction has an arbitrarily small constant multiplicative loss in LWE error size. For the proof, we make use of techniques by Genise, Micciancio, Peikert and Walter to analyze marginal and conditional distributions of sums of discrete Gaussians.",

Moreover, results such as QIP = QIP(3) (STOC'00) show that quantum resources significantly help in such a task.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we initiate the study of round compression of protocols in the bounded quantum storage model (BQSM). In this model, the malicious parties have a bounded quantum memory and they cannot store the all the qubits that are transmitted in the protocol.\r\n\r\nOur main results in this setting are the following:\r\n1. There is a non-interactive (statistical) witness indistinguishable proof for any language in NP (and even QMA) in BQSM in the plain model. We notice that in this protocol, only the memory of the verifier is bounded.\r\n2. Any classical proof system can be compressed in a two-message quantum proof system in BQSM. Moreover, if the original proof system is zero-knowledge, the quantum protocol is zero-knowledge too. In this result, we assume that the prover has bounded memory.\r\n\r\nFinally, we give evidence towards the \"tightness\" of our results. First, we show that NIZK in the plain model against BQS adversaries is unlikely with standard techniques.

    "abstract": "We revisit the question of the overhead to achieve full security (i.e., guaranteed output delivery) in secure multiparty computation (MPC). Recent works have closed the gap between full security and semi-honest security, by introducing protocols where the parties first compute the circuit using a semi-honest protocol and then run a verification step with sublinear communication in the circuit size. However, in these works the number of interaction rounds in the verification step is also sublinear in the circuit's size. Unlike communication, the round complexity of the semi-honest execution typically grows with the circuit's depth and not its size. Hence, for large but shallow circuits, this additional number of rounds incurs a significant overhead. Motivated by this gap, we make the following contributions:\r\n\r\n1. We present a new MPC framework to obtain full security, compatible with effectively any ring, that has an additive communication overhead of only $O(\\log |C|)$, where $|C|$ is the number of multiplication gates in the circuit, and a constant number of additional rounds beyond the underlying semi-honest protocol. Our framework works with any linear secret sharing scheme and relies on a new to utilize the machinery of zero-knowledge fully linear interactive oracle proofs (zk-FLIOP) in a black-box way. We present several instantiations to the building blocks of our compiler, from which we derive concretely efficient protocols in different settings.\r\n\r\n2. We present extensions to the zk-FLIOP primitive for very general settings. The first one is for proving statements over potentially non-commutative rings, where the only requirement is that the ring has a large enough set where (1) every element in the set commutes with every element in the ring, and (2) the difference between any two distinct elements is invertible. Our second zk-FLIOP extension is for proving statements over Galois Rings. For these rings, we present concrete improvements on the current state-of-the-art for the case of constant-round proofs, by making use of Reverse Multiplication Friendly Embeddings (RMFEs).",

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose verifiable secret sharing (VSS) schemes\r\nsecure for any honest majority in the synchronous model, and that only use symmetric-key cryptographic tools, therefore having plausibly post-quantum security. Compared to the state-of-the-art scheme with these features (Atapoor et al., Asiacrypt `23), our main improvement lies on the complexity of the ``optimistic'' scenario where the dealer and all but a small number of receivers behave honestly in the sharing phase: in this case, the running time and download complexity (amount of information read) of each honest verifier is polylogarithmic and the total amount of broadcast information by the dealer is logarithmic; all these complexities were linear in the aforementioned work by Atapoor et al. At the same time, we preserve these complexities with respect to the previous work for the ``pessimistic'' case where the dealer or $O(n)$ receivers cheat actively.\r\nThe new VSS protocol is of interest in multiparty computations where each party runs one VSS as a dealer, such as distributed key generation protocols.\r\n\r\nOur main technical handle is a distributed zero-knowledge proof of low degreeness of a polynomial, in the model of Boneh et al. (Crypto `19) where the statement (in this case the evaluations of the witness polynomial) is distributed among several verifiers, each knowing one evaluation. Using folding techniques similar to FRI (Ben-Sasson et al., ICALP `18) we construct such a proof where each verifier receives polylogarithmic information and runs in polylogarithmic time.",

    "abstract": "The significance of succinct zero-knowledge proofs has increased considerably in recent times. However, one of the major challenges that hinder the prover's efficiency is when dealing with Boolean circuits. In particular, the conversion of each bit into a finite field element incurs a blow-up of more than 100x in terms of both memory usage and computation time.\r\n\r\nThis work focuses on data-parallel Boolean circuits that contain numerous identical sub-circuits. These circuits are widely used in real-world applications, such as proving a large number of hash-preimages in zkEVM and zkBridge. We develop a method for constructing succinct arguments with $2^{-\\lambda}$ soundness error and $O(\\omega(1)\\frac{N}{\\log{N}} \\log{\\log{N}})$ RAM operations, or $O(\\frac{N}{\\log{N}}\\log\\log N)$ finite field additions, along with a negligible number of finite field multiplications.\r\n\r\nOur approach is based on using the GKR protocol to obtain the succinct argument.",

    "abstract": "RAM (random access memory) is an important primitive in verifiable computation. In this paper, we focus on realizing RAM with efficient batching property, i.e, proving a batch of $m$ updates on a RAM of size $N$ while incurring a cost that is sublinear in $N$. Classical approaches based on Merkle-trees or address ordered transcripts to model RAM correctness are either concretely inefficient, or incur linear overhead in the size of the RAM. Recent works explore cryptographic accumulators based on unknown-order groups (RSA, class-groups) to model the RAM state. While recent RSA accumulator based approaches offer significant improvement over classical methods, they incur linear overhead in the size of the accumulated set to compute witnesses, as well as prohibitive constant overheads.\r\n\r\nWe realize a batching-efficient RAM with superior asymptotic and concrete costs as compared to existing approaches. Towards this: (i) we build on recent constructions of lookup arguments to allow efficient lookups even in presence of table updates, and (ii) we realize a variant of sub-vector relation addressed in prior works, which we call committed index lookup. We combine the two building blocks to realize batching-efficient RAM with sublinear dependence on size of the RAM. Our construction incurs an amortized proving cost of $\\tilde{O}(m\\log m + \\sqrt{mN})$ for a batch of $m$ updates on a RAM of size $N$. Our results also benefit the recent arguments for sub-vector relation, by enabling them to be efficient in presence of updates to the table. We believe that this is a contribution of independent interest. \r\n\r\nWe implement our solution to evaluate its concrete efficiency. Our experiments show that it offers significant improvement over existing works on batching-efficient accumulators/RAMs, with a substantially reduced resource barrier.",

    "abstract": "Almost perfect nonlinear (in brief, APN) functions are vectorial functions $F:\\mathbb F_2^n\\rightarrow \\mathbb F_2^n$ playing roles in several domains of information protection, at the intersection of computer science and mathematics. Their definition comes from cryptography and is also related to coding theory. \r\nWhen they are used as substitution boxes (S-boxes, which are the only nonlinear components in block ciphers), APN functions contribute optimally to the resistance against differential attacks. This makes of course a strong cryptographic motivation for their study, which has been very active since the 90's, and has posed interesting and difficult mathematical questions, some of which are still unanswered. \\\\Since the introduction of differential attacks, more recent types of cryptanalyses have been designed, such as integral attacks. No notion about S-boxes has been identified which would play a similar role with respect to integral attacks. In this paper, we study two generalizations of APNness that are  natural from a mathematical point of view, since they directly extend classical characterizations  of APN functions. We call these two notions strong non-normality and sum-freedom. The former existed already for Boolean functions and the latter is new. We study how they are related to cryptanalyses (the relation is stronger for sum-freedom). \r\nThe two notions behave differently from each other while they have similar definitions. They behave differently from differential uniformity, which is a well-known generalization of APNness. We study the different ways to define them, and on the example of Kasami functions, how difficult they are. We prove their satisfiability, their monotonicity, their invariance under classical equivalence relations and we characterize them by the Walsh transform.\r\n  \\\\\r\nWe begin a study of the multiplicative inverse function (used as a substitution box in the Advanced Encryption Standard and other block ciphers) from the viewpoint of these two notions. In particular, we find a simple expression of the sum of the values taken by this function over affine subspaces of $\\mathbb F_{2^n}$ that are not vector subspaces. This formula shows that, in such case, the sum never vanishes (which is a remarkable property of the inverse function). We also give a formula for the case of a vector space defined by one of its bases.",

    "abstract": "Structure-Aware Private Set Intersection (sa-PSI), recently introduced by Garimella et al. (Crypto'22), is a PSI variant where Alice's input set $S_A$ has a publicly known structure (for example, interval, ball or union of balls) and Bob's input $S_B$ is an unstructured set of elements. Prior work achieves sa-PSI where the communication cost only scales with the description size of $S_A$ instead of the set cardinality. However, the computation cost remains linear in the cardinality of $S_A$, which could be prohibitively large.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we present a new semi-honest sa-PSI framework where both computation and communication costs only scale with the description size of $S_A$. Our main building block is a new primitive that we introduce called Incremental Boolean Function Secret Sharing (ibFSS), which is a generalization of FSS that additionally allows for evaluation on input prefixes. We formalize definitions and construct a weak ibFSS for a $d$-dimensional ball with $\\ell_\\infty$ norm, which may be of independent interest. Independently, we improve spatial hashing techniques (from prior work) when $S_A$ has structure union of $d$-dimensional balls in $(\\{0,1\\}^u)^d$, each of diameter $\\delta$, from $O(u \\cdot d \\cdot (\\log \\delta)^d)$ to $O(\\log \\delta \\cdot d)$ in terms of both computation and communication. Finally, we resolve the following open questions from prior work with communication and computation scaling with the description size of the structured set.\r\n- Our PSI framework can handle a union of overlapping structures, while prior work strictly requires a disjoint union. \r\n- We have a new construction that enables Bob with unstructured input $S_B$ to learn the intersection. \r\n- We extend to a richer class of functionalities like structure-aware PSI Cardinality and PSI-Sum of associated values.",

    "abstract": "We present a formally verified proof of the correctness and IND-CCA security of ML-KEM, the Kyber-based Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) undergoing standardization by NIST.\r\nThe proof is machine-checked in EasyCrypt and it includes: \r\n1) A formalization of the correctness (decryption failure probability) and IND-CPA security  of the Kyber base public-key encryption scheme, following Bos et al. at Euro S&P 2018;\r\n2) A formalization of the relevant variant of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transform in the Random Oracle Model (ROM), which follows closely (but not exactly) Hofheinz, Hovelmanns and Kiltz at TCC 2017; \r\n3) A proof that the IND-CCA security of the ML-KEM specification and its correctness as a KEM follows from the previous results; \r\n4) Two formally verified implementations of ML-KEM written in Jasmin that are provably constant-time, functionally equivalent to the ML-KEM specification and, for this reason, inherit the provable security guarantees established in the previous points.\r\nThe top-level theorems give self-contained concrete bounds for the correctness and security of MLKEM down to (a variant of) Module-LWE. We discuss how they are built modularly by leveraging various EasyCrypt features.",

We formulate an algebraic version of this event, the so-called Dense Submodule Discovery (DSD) event, and heuristically predict under which conditions this event happens. For that, we formulate an algebraic version of the Geometric Series Assumption -- an heuristic tool that describes the behaviour of algebraic lattice reduction algorithms. We verify this assumption by implementing an algebraic LLL -- an analog of classical LLL lattice reduction that operates on the module level. Our experiments verify the introduced heuristic, enabling us to predict the algebraic DSD event.",

    "abstract": "The increasing importance of graph databases and cloud storage services prompts the study of private queries on graphs. We propose PathGES, a graph encryption scheme (GES) for single-pair shortest path queries. PathGES is efficient and mitigates the state-of-the-art attack by Falzon and Paterson (2022) on the GES by Ghosh, Kamara, and Tamassia (2021), while only incurring an additional logarithmic factor in storage overhead. PathGES leverages a novel data structure that minimizes leakage and server computation. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe generalize what it means for one leakage function to leak less than another by defining a relation with respect to a family of query sequences and show that our scheme provably leaks less than the GKT scheme when all queries have been issued. We complement our security proof with a cryptanalysis that demonstrates an information-theoretic gap in the size of the query reconstruction space of our scheme as compared to the GKT scheme and provide concrete examples of the gap for several graph families. Our prototype implementation of PathGES is efficient in practice for real-world social network and geographic data sets. In comparison with the GKT scheme, PathGES has on average the same response size and up to 1.5$\\times$ faster round-trip query time.",

    "abstract": "Asynchronous Remote Key Generation (ARKG) is a primitive introduced by Frymann et al. at ACM CCS 2020. It enables a sender to generate a new public key $pk'$ for a receiver ensuring only it can, at a later time, compute the corresponding private key sk'. These key pairs are indistinguishable from freshly generated ones and can be used in various public-key cryptosystems such as digital signatures and public-key encryption. ARKG has been explored for applications in WebAuthn credential backup and delegation, as well as for enhancing receiver privacy via stealth addresses.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce distributed ARKG (dARKG) aiming to provide similar security properties in a distributed setting. Here, a sender generates $pk'$ for a group of $n$ receivers and the corresponding $sk'$ can only be computed by any sub-group of size $t\\leq n$. This introduces threshold-based access protection for $sk'$, enabling for instance a set of proxies to jointly access a WebAuthn account or claim blockchain funds.\r\n\r\nWe construct dARKG using one-round publicly verifiable asymmetric key agreement, called 1PVAKA, a new primitive formalized in this work.\r\nUnlike traditional distributed key generation protocols where users interact with one another, 1PVAKA is asynchronous and allows a third party to verify and generate a public key from users' outputs.\r\n\r\nWe discuss 1PVAKA and dARKG instantiations tailored for use with bilinear groups and demonstrate practicality with implementation and performance analysis for the BLS12-381 curve.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of artificial intelligence and big data has resulted in a surge in data demand and increased data dimensionality. This escalation has consequently heightened the costs associated with storage and processing. Concurrently, the confidential nature of data collected by various institutions, which cannot be disclosed due to personal privacy concerns, has exacerbated the challenges associated with data analysis and machine learning model training. Therefore, designing a secure and efficient high-dimensional data reduction method that supports multi-party joint participation becomes critical to solving these problems.\r\n\r\nThis paper proposes a novel homomorphic encryption dimensionality reduction scheme (HE-DR) based on CKKS, which modifies the Rank-Revealing (RR) method to make it more applicable to fully homomorphic encryption, thereby achieving fast and secure dimension reduction for high-dimensional data. Compared to traditional homomorphic encryption dimensionality reduction schemes, our approach does not transmit the user\u2019s original data to other participants in any format (Ciphertext or Plaintext). Moreover, our method's computational efficiency is nearly $60-200$ times faster than similar algorithms, and the communication overhead is only $1/3$ of theirs. Finally, we have shown that our proposed scheme can preserve its computational efficiency and accuracy even when dealing with high-dimensional data. As dimensionality escalates, the ratio of ciphertext to plaintext computational efficiency plateaus at approximately 5 times, while the computational error (distance between subspaces) remains around $1e^{-11}$",

    "abstract": "What are the minimal cryptographic assumptions that suffice for constructing efficient argument systems, and for which tasks? Recently, Amit and Rothblum [STOC 2023] showed that one-way functions suffice for constructing constant-round arguments for bounded-depth computations. In this work we ask: what other tasks have efficient argument systems based only on one-way functions? We show two positive results:\r\n\r\nFirst, we construct a new argument system for batch-verification of $k$ $UP$ statements ($NP$ statements with a unique witness) for witness relations that are verifiable in depth $D$. Taking $M$ to be the length of a single witness, the communication complexity is $O(\\log k) \\cdot  (M + k \\cdot D \\cdot n^{\\sigma})$, where $\\sigma > 0$ is an arbitrarily small constant. In particular, the communication is quasi-linear in the length of a single witness, so long as ${k < M / (D \\cdot n^{\\sigma})}$.\r\nThe number of rounds is constant and the honest prover runs in polynomial time given witnesses for all $k$ inputs' membership in the language. \r\n\r\nOur second result is a constant-round doubly-efficient argument system for languages in $P$ that are computable by bounded-space Turing machines. For this class of computations, we obtain an exponential improvement in the trade-off between the number of rounds and the (exponent of the) communication complexity, compared to known unconditionally sound protocols [Reingold, Rothblum and Rothblum, STOC 2016].",

    "abstract": "A primary challenge in isogeny-based cryptography lies in the substantial computational cost associated to computing and evaluating prime-degree isogenies. This computation traditionally relied on V\u00e9lu's formulas, an approach with time complexity linear in the degree but which was further enhanced by Bernstein, De Feo, Leroux, and Smith to a square-root complexity. The improved square-root V\u00e9lu's formulas exhibit a degree of parallelizability that has not been exploited in major implementations. In this study, we introduce a theoretical framework for parallelizing isogeny computations and provide a proof-of-concept implementation in C with OpenMP. While the parallelization effectiveness exhibits diminishing returns with the number of cores, we still obtain strong results when using a small number of cores. Concretely, our implementation shows that for large degrees it is easy to achieve speedup factors of up to $1.74$, $2.54$, and $3.44$ for two, four, and eight cores, respectively.",

    "abstract": "In this research, we introduce MIND-Crypt, a novel attack framework that uses deep learning (DL) and transfer learning (TL) to challenge the indistinguishability of block ciphers, specifically SPECK32/64 encryption algorithm in CBC mode (Cipher Block Chaining) against Known Plaintext Attacks (KPA). Our methodology includes training a DL model with ciphertexts of two messages encrypted using the same key. The selected messages have the same byte-length and differ by only one bit at the binary level. This DL model employs a residual network architecture. For the TL, we use the trained DL model as a feature extractor, and these features are then used to train a shallow machine learning, such as XGBoost. This dual strategy aims to distinguish ciphertexts of two encrypted messages, addressing traditional cryptanalysis challenges.\r\n\r\nOur findings demonstrate that the deep learning model achieves an accuracy of approximately 99% under consistent cryptographic conditions (Same Key or Rounds) with the SPECK32/64 cipher. However, performance degrades to random guessing levels (50%) when tested with ciphertext generated from different keys or different encryption rounds of SPECK32/64. To enhance the results, the DL model requires retraining with different keys or encryption rounds using larger datasets ($10^{7}$ samples). To overcome this limitation, we implement TL, achieving an accuracy of about 53% with just 10,000 samples, which is better than random guessing. Further training with 580,000 samples increases accuracy to nearly 99%, showing a substantial reduction in data requirements by over 94%. This shows that an attacker can utilize machine learning models to break indistinguishability by accessing pairs of plaintexts and their corresponding ciphertexts encrypted with the same key, without directly interacting with the communicating parties.",

    "abstract": "At Eurocrypt $2021$, Li and Micciancio demonstrated that the IND-CPA notion of security is not sufficient to cover the passive security of approximate homomorphic encryption schemes, by outlining a key recovery attack against the CKKS scheme (Cheon, Kim, Kim, Seong, Asiacrypt $2017$). They proposed the notion of $q$-IND-CPA-D security, which allows an adversary to make $q$ calls to a restricted decryption oracle. Li and Micciancio left achieving $q$-IND-CPA-D security as an open problem, but proposed two approaches: noise flooding and an exact version of CKKS.\r\nThe first approach was addressed by Li, Micciancio, Schultz and Sorrell (Crypto 2022), but leads to substantial efficiency loss.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we look at the second approach.\r\nWe define $(\\delta, r)$-exact CKKS, a version of CKKS that returns exact results on all except the least $r$ significant bits with (high) probability $\\delta$, based on bounds on the noise. We prove that the advantage of a $q$-IND-CPA-D attacker against $(\\delta, r)$-exact CKKS is determined by the failure probability of those bounds. We conduct a tight average-case and implementation-specific noise analysis of all elementary operations in CKKS, as implemented in the Lattigo library, including the bootstrapping operation. We propose bounds that have small enough failure probability for the advantage of a $q$-IND-CPA-D attacker against $(\\delta,r)$-exact CKKS to become smaller than $2^{-128}$, while the parameter sets needed remain practical. We furthermore present an estimator tool that combines the bounds on basic operations and returns tight noise estimates, even for large circuits. We validate our bounds by showcasing experimental results on different iterative algorithms, homomorphic encoding, decoding and bootstrapping.",

    "abstract": "HyperPlonk is a recent SNARK proposal  (Eurocrypt'23) that features a linear-time prover and  supports custom gates of larger degree than Plonk.  For the time being,  its instantiations are only proven to be knowledge-sound (meaning that soundness is only guaranteed when the prover runs in isolation) while many applications motivate the stronger notion of simulation-extractability (SE). Unfortunately, the most efficient SE compilers are not immediately applicable to multivariate polynomial interactive oracle proofs.  To address this problem, we provide an instantiation of HyperPlonk for which we can prove simulation-extractability in a strong sense. As a crucial building block, we describe  KZG-based commitments to multivariate polynomials that also provide    simulation-extractability while remaining as efficient as  malleable ones.  Our proofs stand  in the combined algebraic group and random oracle model and ensure straight-line extractability (i.e., without rewinding).",

    "abstract": "The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) brings about transformative potential across sectors, but its dual-use nature also amplifies risks. Governments globally are grappling with the challenge of regulating GenAI, balancing innovation against safety. China, the United States (US), and the European Union (EU) are at the forefront with initiatives like the Management of Algorithmic Recommendations, the Executive Order, and the AI Act, respectively. However, the rapid evolution of GenAI capabilities often outpaces the development of comprehensive safety measures, creating a gap between regulatory needs and technical advancements.\r\n\r\nA workshop co-organized by Google, University of Wisconsin, Madison (UW-Madison), and Stanford University aimed to bridge this gap between GenAI policy and technology. The diverse stakeholders of the GenAI space\u2014from the public and governments to academia and industry\u2014make any safety measures under consideration more complex, as both technical feasibility and regulatory guidance must be realized. This paper summarizes the discussions during the workshop which addressed questions, such as: How regulation can be designed without hindering technological progress? How technology can evolve to meet regulatory standards? The interplay between legislation and technology is a very vast topic, and we don\u2019t claim that this paper is a comprehensive treatment on this topic. This paper is meant to capture findings based on the workshop, and hopefully, can guide discussion on this topic.",

    "abstract": "We construct an indistinguishability obfuscation (IO) scheme from the sub-exponential hardness of the decisional linear problem on bilinear groups together with two variants of the learning parity with noise (LPN) problem, namely large-field LPN and (binary-field) sparse LPN. This removes the need to assume the existence pseudorandom generators (PRGs) in $\\mathsf{NC}^0$ with polynomial stretch from the state-of-the-art construction of IO (Jain, Lin, and Sahai, EUROCRYPT 2022). As an intermediate step in our construction, we abstract away a notion of structured-seed polynomial-stretch PRGs in $\\mathsf{NC}^0$ which suffices for IO and is implied by both sparse LPN and the existence of polynomial-stretch PRGs in $\\mathsf{NC}^0$.\r\n\r\nAs immediate applications, from the sub-exponential hardness of the decisional linear assumption on bilinear groups, large-field LPN, and sparse LPN, we get alternative constructions of (a) fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) without lattices or circular security assumptions (Canetti, Lin, Tessaro, and Vaikuntanathan, TCC 2015), and (b) perfect zero-knowledge adaptively-sound succinct non-interactive arguments (SNARGs) for NP (Waters and Wu, STOC 2024).",

    "abstract": "We present a framework for speeding up the search for preimages of candidate one-way functions based on highly biased differential-linear distinguishers. It is naturally applicable to preimage attacks on hash functions. Further, a variant of this framework applied to keyed functions leads to accelerated key-recovery attacks. Interestingly, our technique is able to exploit related-key differential-linear distinguishers in the single-key model without querying the target  encryption oracle with unknown but related keys. This is in essence similar to how we speed up the key search based on the well known complementation property of DES, which calls for caution from the designers in building primitives meant to be secure in the single-key setting without a thorough cryptanalysis in the related-key model. We apply the method to sponge-based hash function Ascon-HASH, XOFs XOEsch/Ascon-XOF and AEAD Schwaemm, etc. Accelerated preimage or key-recovery attacks are obtained. Note that all the differential-linear distinguishers employed in this work are highly biased and thus can be experimentally verified.",

    "abstract": "The Ascon specification defines among others an encryption scheme offering authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) which is based on a duplex mode of a sponge. With that it is the first of such algorithm selected and about to be standardized by NIST.\r\nThe sponge size is comparatively small, 320 bits, as expected for lightweight cryptography. With that, the strength of the defined AEAD algorithm is limited to 128 bits. Albeit, the definition of the Ascon AEAD algorithm integrates with the associated sponge, it is mathematically not bound to exactly this sponge function. Thus, the Ascon AEAD specification can be used with a different sponge and still operate as defined by the Ascon authors.\r\nThis specification defines the Ascon-Keccak AEAD algorithm which replaces the Ascon sponge with the Keccak sponge, leaving the Ascon AEAD algorithm unchanged. The selected parameters for Ascon-Keccak AEAD offer two algorithm strengths: Ascon-Keccak 256 with a classic security strength of 256 bits and a quantum security strength of 128 bits. In addition, Ascon-Keccak 512 provides an algorithm with 512 bit classic security strength and 256 bit quantum security strength. The selected parameters for Ascon-Keccak 256 offer a significant higher performance on 64-bit architectures than Ascon-128 and Ascon-128a. The performance of Ascon-Keccak 512 is in league with Ascon-128. Yet, with the Keccak sponge size of 1600 bits, Ascon-Keccak cannot be considered a lightweight cryptographic algorithm any more. A reference implementation of the algorithm is provided as referenced in the document.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the computation of complex mathematical functions in statements executed on top of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP); these functions may include roots, exponentials and logarithms, trigonometry etc. While existing approaches to these functions in privacy-preserving computations (and sometimes also in general-purpose processors) have relied on polynomial approximation, more powerful methods are available for ZKP. In this paper, we note that in ZKP, all algebraic functions are exactly computable. Recognizing that, we proceed to the approximation of transcendental functions with algebraic functions. We develop methods of approximation, instantiate them on a number of common transcendental functions, and benchmark their precision and efficiency in comparison with best polynomial approximations.",

    "abstract": "We present the first comprehensive approach for detecting and analyzing symmetric cryptographic primitives in gate-level descriptions of hardware. To capture both ASICs and FPGAs, we model the hardware as a directed graph, where gates become nodes and wires become edges. For modern chips, those graphs can easily consist of hundreds of thousands of nodes. More abstractly, we find subgraphs corresponding to cryptographic primitives in a potentially huge graph, the sea-of-gates, describing an entire chip. As we are particularly interested in unknown cryptographic algorithms, we cannot rely on searching for known parts such as S-boxes or round constants. \r\nInstead, we are looking for parts of the chip that perform highly local computations. A major result of our work is that many symmetric algorithms can be reliably located and sometimes even identified by our approach, which we call HAWKEYE. Our findings are verified by extensive experimental results, which involve SPN, ARX, Feistel, and LFSR-based ciphers implemented for both FPGAs and ASICs. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of HAWKEYE by evaluating it on OpenTitan's Earl Grey chip, an open-source secure micro-controller design. HAWKEYE locates all major cryptographic primitives present in the netlist comprising 424341 gates in 44.3 seconds.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate Cryptography is one of the main candidates for Post-quantum Cryptography. Multivariate schemes are usually constructed by applying two secret affine invertible transformations $\\mathcal S,\\mathcal T$ to a set of multivariate polynomials $\\mathcal{F}$ (often quadratic). The secret polynomials  $\\mathcal{F}$ posses a trapdoor that allows the legitimate user to find a solution of the corresponding system, while the public polynomials $\\mathcal G=\\mathcal S\\circ\\mathcal F\\circ\\mathcal T$ look like random polynomials. The polynomials $\\mathcal G$ and $\\mathcal F$ are said to be affine equivalent.

    "abstract": "In a federated learning (FL) system, decentralized data owners (clients) could upload their locally trained models to a central server, to jointly train a global model. Malicious clients may plant backdoors into the global model through uploading poisoned local models, causing misclassification to a target class when encountering attacker-defined triggers. Existing backdoor defenses show inconsistent performance under different system and adversarial settings, especially when the malicious updates are made statistically close to the benign ones. In this paper, we first reveal the fact that planting subsequent backdoors with the same target label could significantly help to maintain the accuracy of previously planted back- doors, and then propose a novel proactive backdoor detection mechanism for FL named BackdoorIndicator, which has the server inject indicator tasks into the global model leveraging out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and then utilizing the fact that any backdoor samples are OOD samples with respect to benign samples, the server, who is completely agnostic of the potential backdoor types and target labels, can accurately detect the presence of backdoors in uploaded models, via evaluating the indicator tasks. We perform systematic and extensive empirical studies to demonstrate the consistently superior performance and practicality of BackdoorIndicator over baseline defenses, across a wide range of system and adversarial settings.",

We show that designing mechanisms that prevent both length leakage and access pattern leakage requires navigating a three-way tradeoff between storage footprint, bandwidth footprint, and the information leaked to the adversary.

    "abstract": "Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) allows a (host) device with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to prove that it has a certified configuration of hardware and software whilst preserving the privacy of the device. All deployed DAA schemes are based on classical security assumptions. Despite a long line of works proposing post-quantum designs, the vast majority give only theoretical schemes and where concrete parameters are computed, their efficiency is far from practical.\r\n \r\nOur first contribution is to define collaborative, segregated, non-interactive zero knowledge (CoSNIZK). This notion generalizes the property of collaborative zero-knowledge as formalised by Ozdemir and Boneh (USENIX \u201922) so that the zero-knowledge property need only apply to a subset of provers during collaborative proof generation. This if of particular interest for proxy-cryptography in which part of an expensive but sensitive computation may be delegated to another party. We give a lattice-based CoSNIZK based on the highly efficient proof framework in (Crypto \u201922). \r\n\r\nOur main contribution is the construction of a DAA based on the hardness of problems over module lattices as well as the ISISf assumption recently introduced by Bootle et al. (Crypto \u201923). A key component of our work is the CoSNIZK construction which allows the TPM and host to jointly create attestations whilst protecting TPM key material from a potentially corrupt host. We prove the security of our DAA scheme according to the well-established UC definition of Camenisch et al. (PKC \u201916). Our design achieves DAA signatures more than 1.5 orders of magnitude smaller than previous works at only 38KB making it the first truly practical candidate for post-quantum DAA.",

    "abstract": "Boolean Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) enables secure outsourcing of databases to an untrusted server in encrypted form and allows the client to execute secure Boolean queries involving multiple keywords. The leakage of keyword pair result pattern (KPRP) in a Boolean search poses a significant threat, which reveals the intersection of documents containing any two keywords involved in a search and can be exploited by attackers to recover plaintext information about searched keywords (USENIX Security\u201916). However, existing KPRP-hiding schemes either rely on Bloom filters (S&P\u201914, CCS\u201918), leading to high false positive search results (where non-matching documents could be erroneously identified as matches) that hinder the extension to multi-client settings (CCS\u201913), or require excessive server storage (PETS\u201923), making them impractical for large-scale sparse databases.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we introduce Hidden Boolean Search (HBS), the first KPRP-hiding Boolean SSE scheme with both negligible false positives (essential for satisfying the standard correctness definition of SSE) and low server storage requirements. HBS leverages a novel cryptographic tool called Result-hiding Filter (RH-filter). It distinguishes itself as the first tool that supports computationally correct membership queries with hiding results at nearly constant overhead. With the help of RH-filter, compared to the most efficient KPRP-hiding scheme (CCS\u201918) in terms of overall storage and search efficiency, HBS surpasses it across all performance metrics, mitigates false positives, and achieves significantly stronger query expressiveness. We further extend HBS to the dynamic setting, resulting in a scheme named DHBS, which maintains KPRP-hiding while ensuring forward and backward privacy\u2014two critical security guarantees in the dynamic setting.",

    "abstract": "Homomorphic encryption can address key privacy challenges in cloud-based outsourcing by enabling potentially untrusted servers to perform meaningful computation directly on encrypted data. While most homomorphic encryption schemes offer addition and multiplication over ciphertexts natively, any non-linear functions must be implemented as costly polynomial approximations due to this restricted computational model. Nevertheless, the CGGI cryptosystem is capable of performing arbitrary univariate functions over ciphertexts in the form of lookup tables through the use of programmable bootstrapping. While promising, this procedure can quickly become costly when high degrees of precision are required. To address this challenge, we propose Ripple: a framework that introduces different approximation methodologies based on discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) to decrease the number of entries in homomorphic lookup tables while maintaining high accuracy. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate significant error reduction compared to plain quantization methods across multiple non-linear functions. Notably, Ripple improves runtime performance for several realistic benchmarks, such as logistic regression and cross-correlation, among others.",

    "abstract": "We design and implement a novel post-quantum signature scheme based on the Legendre PRF, named Loquat. Prior to this work, efficient approaches for constructing post-quantum signatures with comparable security assumptions mainly used the MPC-in-the-head paradigm or hash trees. Our method departs from these paradigms and, notably, is SNARK-friendly, a feature not commonly found in earlier designs. Loquat requires significantly fewer computational operations for verification than other symmetric-key-based post-quantum signature schemes that support stateless many-time signing. Notably, the performance of Loquat remains practical even when employing algebraic hash functions. Our Python-based implementations of Loquat demonstrate a signature size of 46KB, with a signing time of 5.04 seconds and a verification time of merely 0.21 seconds. Instantiating the random oracle with an algebraic hash function results in the R1CS constraints for signature verification being about 148K, 7 to 175 times smaller than those required for state-of-the-art MPC-in-the-head-based signatures and 3 to 9 times less than those for SPHINCS+ [Bernstein et al. CCS\u201919].\r\n\r\nWe explore two applications of Loquat. First, we incorporate it into the ID-based ring signature scheme [Buser et al. ACNS\u201922], achieving a significant reduction in signature size from 1.9 MB to 0.9 MB with stateless signing and practical master key generation. Our second application presents a SNARK-based aggregate signature scheme. We use the implementations of Aurora [Ben-Sasson et al. EC\u201919] and Fractal [Chiesa et al. EC\u201920] to benchmark our aggregate signature\u2019s performance. Our findings show that aggregating 32 Loquat signatures using Aurora results in a proving time of about 7 minutes, a verification time of 66 seconds, and an aggregate signature size of 197 KB. Furthermore, by leveraging the recursive proof composition feature of Fractal, we achieve an aggregate signature with a constant size of 145 KB, illustrating Loquat\u2019s potential for scalability in cryptographic applications.",

    "abstract": "One of the most promising avenues for realizing scalable proof systems relies on the existence of 2-cycles of pairing-friendly elliptic curves. Such a cycle consists of two elliptic curves E/GF(p) and E'/GF(q) that both have a low embedding degree and also satisfy q = #E and p = #E'. These constraints turn out to be rather restrictive; in the decade that has passed since 2-cycles were first proposed for use in proof systems, no new constructions of 2-cycles have been found.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we generalize the notion of cycles of pairing-friendly elliptic curves to study cycles of pairing-friendly abelian varieties, with a view towards realizing more efficient pairing-based SNARKs. We show that considering abelian varieties of dimension larger than 1 unlocks a number of interesting possibilities for finding pairing-friendly cycles, and we give several new constructions that can be instantiated at any security level.",

    "abstract": "The shuffle model has recently emerged as a popular setting for differential privacy, where clients can communicate with a central server using anonymous channels or an intermediate message shuffler. This model was also explored in the context of cryptographic tasks such as secure aggregation and private information retrieval (PIR). However, this study was almost entirely restricted to the stringent notion of information-theoretic security. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we study computationally secure aggregation protocols and PIR in the shuffle model. Our starting point is the insight that the previous technique of shuffling additive shares can be improved in the computational setting. We show that this indeed holds under the standard learning parity with noise (LPN) assumption, but even better efficiency follows from plausible conjectures about the multi-disjoint syndrome decoding (MDSD) problem that we introduce and study in this work.\r\n\r\nWe leverage the above towards improving the efficiency of secure aggregation and PIR in the shuffle model. For secure aggregation of long vectors, our protocols require $9\\times$-$25\\times$ less communication than the previous information-theoretic solutions. Our PIR protocols enjoy the simplicity and concrete efficiency benefits of multi-server PIR while only requiring a single server to store the database. Under the MDSD assumption, they improve over recent single-server PIR constructions by up to two orders of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "Differential-linear cryptanalysis was introduced by Langford and Hellman in 1994 and has been extensively studied since then. In 2019, Bar-On et al. presented the Differential-Linear Connectivity Table (DLCT), which connects the differential part and the linear part, thus an attacked cipher is divided to 3 subciphers: the differential part, the DLCT part, and the linear part. \r\nIn this paper, we firstly present an accurate mathematical formula which establishes a relation between differential-linear and truncated differential cryptanalysis. Using the formula, the bias estimate of a differential-linear distinguisher can be converted to the probability calculations of a series of truncated differentials. Then, we propose a novel and natural concept, the TDT, which can be used to accelerate the calculation of the probabilities of truncated differentials. Based on the formula and the TDT, we propose two novel approaches for estimating the bias of a differential-linear distinguisher. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our new approaches by applying them to 5 symmetric-key primitives: Ascon, Serpent, KNOT, AES, and CLEFIA. For Ascon and Serpent, we update the best known differential-linear distinguishers. For KNOT AES, and CLEFIA, for the first time we give the theoretical differential-linear biases for different rounds.",

    "abstract": "We study elastic SNARKs, a concept introduced by the elegant work of Gemini (EUROCRYPTO 2022). The prover of elastic SNARKs has multiple configurations with different time and memory tradeoffs and the output proof is independent of the chosen configuration. In addition, during the execution of the protocol, the space-efficient prover can pause the protocol and save the current state. The time-efficient prover can then resume the protocol from that state. Gemini constructs an elastic SNARK for R1CS.\r\n\r\n    We present Epistle, an elastic SNARK for Plonk constraint system. For an instance with size $N$, in the time-efficient configuration, the prover uses $O_{\\lambda} (N)$ cryptographic operations and $O(N)$ memory; in the space-efficient configuration, the prover uses $O_{\\lambda} (N \\log N)$ cryptographic operations and $O(\\log N)$ memory. Compared to Gemini, our approach reduces the asymptotic time complexity of the space-efficient prover by a factor of $\\log N$. The key technique we use is to make the toolbox for multivariate PIOP provided by HyperPlonk (EUROCRYPTO 2023) elastic, with the most important aspect being the redesign of each protocol in the toolbox in the streaming model.\r\n    \r\n    We implement Epistle in Rust. Our benchmarks show that Epistle maintains a stable memory overhead of around $1.5$ GB for instance sizes exceeding $2^{21}$, while the time overhead shows a linear growth trend.",

They are useful in blockchain protocols, and several practical candidates have been proposed based on exponentiation in a large finite field: Sloth++, Veedo, MinRoot.  The underlying assumption of these constructions is that computing an exponentiation $x^e$ requires at least $\\log_2 e$ sequential multiplications.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we analyze the security of these algebraic VDF candidates.

    "abstract": "The Bluetooth protocol for wireless connection between devices comes with several security measures to protect confidentiality and integrity of data. At the heart of these security protocols lies the Secure Simple Pairing, wherewith the devices can negotiate a shared key before communicating sensitive data. Despite the good intentions, the Bluetooth security protocol has repeatedly been shown to be vulnerable, especially with regard to active attacks on the Secure Simple Pairing.\r\n\r\nWe propose here a mechanism to limit active attacks on the Secure Connections protocol (the more secure version of the Secure Simple Pairing protocol), without infringing on the current Bluetooth protocol stack specification. The idea is to run an authentication protocol, like a classical challenge-response step for certified keys, within the existing infrastructure, even at a later, more convenient point in time. We prove that not only does this authentication step ensure freshness of future encryption keys, but an interesting feature is that it\u2014a posteriori\u2014also guarantees security of previously derived encryption keys. We next argue that this approach indeed prevents a large set of known attacks on the Bluetooth protocol.",

    "abstract": "Recent attacks and applications have led to the need for symmetric encryption schemes that, in addition to providing the usual authenticity and privacy, are also committing. In response, many committing authenticated encryption schemes have been proposed. However, all known schemes, in order to provide s bits of committing security, suffer an expansion---this is the length of the ciphertext minus the length of the plaintext---of 2s bits. This incurs a cost in bandwidth or storage. (We typically want s=128, leading to 256-bit expansion.) However, it has been considered unavoidable due to birthday attacks. We show how to bypass this limitation. We give authenticated encryption (AE) schemes that provide s bits of committing security, yet suffer expansion only around s as long as messages are long enough, namely more than s bits. We call such schemes succinct. We do this via a generic, ciphertext-shortening transform called SC: given an AE scheme with 2s-bit expansion, SC returns an AE scheme with s-bit expansion while preserving committing security. SC is very efficient; an AES-based instantiation has overhead just two AES calls. As a tool, SC uses a collision-resistant invertible PRF called HtM, that we design, and whose analysis is technically difficult. To add the committing security that SC assumes to a base scheme, we also give a transform CTY that improves Chan and Rogaway's CTX. Our results hold in a general framework for authenticated encryption, called AE3, that includes both AE1 (also called AEAD) and AE2 (also called nonce-hiding AE) as special cases, so that we in particular obtain succinctly-committing AE schemes for both these settings.",

    "abstract": "In the *Distributed Secret Sharing Generation* (DSG) problem $n$ parties wish to obliviously sample a secret-sharing of a random value $s$ taken from some finite field, without letting any of the parties learn $s$. *Distributed Key Generation* (DKG) is a closely related variant of the problem in which, in addition to their private shares, the parties also generate a public ``commitment'' $g^s$ to the secret. Both DSG and DKG are central primitives in the domain of secure multiparty computation and threshold cryptography. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we study the communication complexity of DSG and DKG. Motivated by large-scale cryptocurrency and blockchain applications, we ask whether it is possible to obtain protocols in which the communication per party is a constant that does not grow with the number of parties. We answer this question to the affirmative in a model where broadcast communication is implemented via a public bulletin board (e.g., a ledger). Specifically, we present a constant-round DSG/DKG protocol in which the number of bits that each party sends/receives from the public bulletin board is a constant that depends only on the security parameter and the field size but does not grow with the number of parties $n$. In contrast, in all existing solutions at least some of the parties send $\\Omega(n)$ bits.\r\n\r\nOur protocol works in the near-threshold setting. Given arbitrary privacy/correctness parameters $0<\\tau_p<\\tau_c<1$, the protocol tolerates up to $\\tau_p n$ actively corrupted parties and delivers shares of a random secret according to some $\\tau_p n$-private $\\tau_c n$-correct secret sharing scheme, such that the adversary cannot bias the secret or learn anything about it. The protocol is based on non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, non-interactive commitments and a novel secret-sharing scheme with special robustness properties that is based on Low-Density Parity-Check codes. As a secondary contribution, we extend the formal MPC-based treatment of DKG/DSG, and study new aspects of Affine Secret Sharing Schemes.",

    "abstract": "The fast correlation attack (FCA) is a powerful cryptanalysis technique that targets stream ciphers based on linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs). Several FCAs were applied to small state stream ciphers (SSCs). In this paper, the idea of multiple sampling is proposed to use the available keystream bits more efficiently and decrease the data complexity of the attacks. This idea helps to overcome the limitation of SSCs on the number of output keystream bits. Moreover, we classify the parity check equations obtained from the different sampling rounds into different groups to ensure that the round keys used in these equations are the same. Our attack is applied to the Fruit-80 and reduces the data complexity from 2^56.82 to 2^49.82. This modified FCA can be applied to all SSCs with limited round key periods. Finally, we suggest a new design idea to strengthen SSCs against FCAs.",

    "abstract": "We provide explicit radical $N$-isogeny formulae for all odd integers $N$. The formulae are compact closed-form expressions which require one $N$th root computation and $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ basic field operations. The formulae are highly efficient to compute a long chain of $N$-isogenies, and have the potential to be extremely beneficial for speeding up certain cryptographic protocols such as CSIDH. Unfortunately, the formulae are conjectured, but we provide ample supporting evidence which strongly suggests their correctness.\r\n\r\nFor CSIDH-512, we notice an additional 35% speed-up when using radical isogenies up to $N=199$, compared to the work by Castryck, Decru, Houben and Vercauteren, which uses radical isogenies up to $N=19$ only. The addition of our radical isogenies also speeds up the computation of larger class group actions in a comparable fashion.",

We discuss why current approaches are not suitable and then propose a novel notion,  GOD-less broadcast, that solves the issue. Like conventional notions of broadcast,  GOD-less broadcast guarantees consistency. However, it does not provide Guaranteed Output Delivery (GOD). We provide an efficient realization of this new notion using a hidden committee of randomly selected and initially undisclosed users which endorse the current view. We also introduce and analyze a new concept of a quorum which ensures consistency among all honest active users. Our  GOD-less broadcast protocol is practical and applicable to existing large scale Key Transparency systems, e.g. the Key Transparency used in WhatsApp.",

    "abstract": "Atomic cross-chain swap, which allows users to exchange coins securely, is critical functionality to facilitate inter-currency exchange and trading. Although most classic atomic swap protocols based on Hash Timelock Contracts have been applied and deployed in practice, they are substantially far from universality due to the inherent dependence of rich scripting language supported by the underlying blockchains. The recently proposed Universal Atomic Swaps protocol [IEEE S\\&P'22] takes a novel path to scriptless cross-chain swap, and it ingeniously delegates scripting functionality to cryptographic lock mechanisms, particularly the adaptor signature and timed commitment schemes designed to guarantee atomicity. However, in this work, we discover a new form of attack called double-claiming attack, such that the honest user would lose coins with overwhelming probability and atomicity is directly broken. Moreover, this attack is easy to carry out and can be naturally generalized to other cross-chain swap protocols as well as the payment channel networks, highlighting a general difficulty in designing universal atomic swap.\r\n\r\nWe present pipeSwap, a cross-chain swap protocol that satisfies both security and practical universality. To avoid transactions of the same frozen coins being double-claimed to violate the atomicity property, pipeSwap proposes a novelly designed paradigm of pipelined coins flow by using two-hop swap and two-hop refund techniques. pipeSwap achieves universality by not relying on any specific script language, aside from the basic ability to verify signatures. Furthermore, we analyze why existing ideal functionality falls short in capturing the atomicity property of Universal Atomic Swaps, and define for the first time ideal functionality to guarantee atomicity. In addition to a detailed security analysis in the Universal Composability framework, we develop a proof-of-concept implementation of pipeSwap with Schnorr/ECDSA signatures, and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the overhead. The experimental results show that pipeSwap can be performed in less than 1.7 seconds and requires less than 7 kb of communication overhead on commodity machines, which demonstrates its high efficiency.",

    "abstract": "ECMQV is a standardized key agreement protocol based on ECC with an additional implicit signature authentication. In this paper we investigate the vulnerability of ECMQV against fault attacks and propose two efficient lattice-based fault attacks. In our attacks, by inducing a storage fault to the ECC parameter $a$ before the execution of ECMQV, we can construct two kinds of weak curves and successfully pass the public-key validation step in the protocol. Then, by solving ECDLP and using a guess-and-determine  method, some information of the victim's temporary private key and the implicit-signature result can be deduced. Based on the retrieved information, we build two new lattice-attack models and recover the upper half of the static private key. Compared with the previous lattice-attack models, our models relax the attack conditions and do not require the exact partial knowledge of the nonces. The validity of the attacks is proven by experimental simulations, which show our attacks pose real threats to the unprotected ECMQV implementations since only one permanent fault is sufficient to retrieve half  bits of the secret key.",

    "abstract": "In the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), convolution operations have primarily been used in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, its utility is increasing with the appearance of convolution integrated transformers or state space models where convolution is a constituent element. In the field of private AI, generalized algorithm, multiplexed parallel convolution was recently proposed to implement CNNs based on the Homomorphic Encryption scheme, residue number system variant Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song. Multiplexed parallel convolution is highly applicable, but its usage has been partly limited due to requiring many rotation operations. In this paper, we propose rotation optimized convolution, which reduces the rotation required for multiplexed parallel convolution, thus lowering latency, enhancing usability, and additionally decreasing the required rotation key. We additionally reduce the size of rotation keys by applying the hierarchical rotation key system, and our proposed small level key system. We also propose a new form of matrix-vector multiplication called Parallel Baby-Step Giant-Step matrix-vector multiplication which also reduces the number of\r\nrotations. In our experiment case, rotation optimized convolution achieved a maximum 70% reduction in execution time and 29\u00d7 reduction for rotation keys using our method. Also, our proposed matrix-vector multiplication method achieved a reduction of execution time by up to 64%.",

    "abstract": "Interactive proofs are a cornerstone of modern cryptography and as such used in many areas, from digital signatures to multy-party computation. Often the knowledge error $\\kappa$ of an interactive proof is not small enough, and thus needs to be reduced. This is usually achieved by repeating the interactive proof in parallel t times. Recently, it was shown that parallel repetition of any $(k_1, \\ldots , k_\\mu)$-special-sound multi-round public-coin interactive proof reduces the knowledge error from $\\kappa$ to $\\kappa^t$, which is optimal. However, in many cases parallel repetitions lead to a significant increase in transcript size. A common technique to mitigate this drawback, which is often used in digital signatures obtained by using the Fiat-Shamir transform, is to use fixed-weight challenges, i.e. vectors of challenges having a constant number of entries equal to a fixed value. While widely used, this method has not been fully assessed from a security standpoint. In particular, the effect of the technique on the knowledge error of the special-sound repeated interactive proof has remained unstudied. In this work, we fill the gap and prove that a fixed-weight repetition of a $(k_1, \\ldots, k_\\mu)$-special-sound multi-round public-coin interactive proof is still knowledge sound. We provide an explicit bound for the knowledge error of the protocol, proving that it matches with the cheating probability of a dishonest prover. Our results apply to some recently-proposed digital signatures which are supposed to be quantum resistant, for example CROSS.",

    "abstract": "In onion routing, a message travels through the network via a series of intermediaries, wrapped in layers of encryption to make it difficult to trace. Onion routing is an attractive approach to realizing anonymous channels because it is simple and fault tolerant. Onion routing protocols provably achieving anonymity in realistic adversary models are known for the synchronous model of communication so far.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we give the first onion routing protocol that achieves anonymity in the asynchronous model of communication. The key tool that our protocol relies on is the novel cryptographic object that we call bruisable onion encryption. The idea of bruisable onion encryption is that even though neither the onion\u2019s path nor its message content can be altered in transit, an intermediate router on the onion\u2019s path that observes that the onion is delayed can nevertheless slightly damage, or bruise it. An onion that is chronically delayed will have been bruised by many intermediaries on its path and become undeliverable. This prevents timing attacks and, as we show, yields a provably secure onion routing protocol in the asynchronous setting.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of advanced cryptographic applications like multi-party computation (MPC), fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs have motivated the designs of the so-called arithmetic-oriented (AO) primitives. Efficient AO primitives typically build over large fields and use large S-boxes. Such design philosophy brings difficulties in the cryptanalysis of these primitives as classical cryptanalysis methods do not apply well. The generally recognized attacks against these primitives are algebraic attacks, especially Groebner basis attacks. Thus, the numbers of security rounds are usually derived through the complexity of solving the system of algebraic equations using Groebner bases. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for algebraic attacks against AO primitives. Instead of using Groebner basis, we use resultants to solve a system of multivariate equations that can better exploit the algebraic structures of AO primitives. We employ several techniques to reduce the dimensions of the resultants and avoid rapid increases in degrees, including meet-in-the-middle modeling, variable substitutions, and fast Lagrange interpolation. We apply our attack to three mainstream AO cryptographic primitives: Rescue-Prime, Anemoi, and Jarvis. For Rescue-Prime, we theoretically prove that the final univariate equation has a degree of at most a specific power of three and practically attack five rounds for the first time. We attack the full-round of Anemoi with complexity 2^110.10, which has been claimed to provide 127 bits of security. We also give the first practical attack against eight rounds of Anemoi over a 55-bit prime field. For Jarvis, we improve the existing practical attack by a factor of 100. Therefore, we point out that our analysis framework can be used as a new evaluation method for AO designs.",

    "abstract": "End-to-end encrypted messaging applications ensure that an attacker cannot read a user's message history without their decryption keys. While this provides strong privacy, it creates a usability problem: if a user loses their devices and cannot access their decryption keys, they can no longer access their account. To solve this usability problem, users should be able to back up their account information with the messaging provider. For privacy, this backup should be encrypted and the provider should not have access to users' decryption keys. To solve this problem, we present Secure Value Recovery 3 (SVR3), a secret key recovery system that distributes trust across different types of hardware enclaves run by different cloud providers in order to protect users' decryption keys. SVR3 is the first deployed secret key recovery system to split trust across heterogeneous enclaves managed by different cloud providers: this design ensures that a single type of enclave does not become a central point of attack. SVR3 protects decryption keys via rollback protection and fault tolerance techniques tailored to the enclaves' security guarantees. SVR3 costs \\$0.0025/user/year and takes 365ms for a user to recover their key, which is a rare operation. A part of SVR3 has been rolled out to millions of real users in a deployment with capacity for over 500 million users, demonstrating the ability to operate at scale.",

    "abstract": "One of the key areas of focus in blockchain research is how to realize privacy-preserving auditing without sacrificing the system\u2019s security and trustworthiness. However, simultaneously achieving auditing and privacy protection, two seemingly contradictory objectives, is challenging because an auditing system would require transparency and accountability which might create privacy and security vulnerabilities. This becomes worse in cross-chain scenarios, where the information silos from multiple chains further complicate the problem. In this paper, we identify three important challenges in cross-chain privacy-preserving auditing, namely Cross-chain Linkability Exposure (CLE), Incompatibility of Privacy and Auditing (IPA), and Full Auditing Inefficiency (FAI). To overcome these challenges, we propose $\\mathsf{zkCross}$, which is a novel two-layer cross-chain architecture equipped with three cross-chain protocols to achieve privacy-preserving cross-chain auditing. Among these three protocols, two are privacy-preserving cross-chain protocols for transfer and exchange, respectively; the third one is an efficient cross-chain auditing protocol. These protocols are built on solid cross-chain schemes to guarantee privacy protection and audit efficiency. We implement $\\mathsf{zkCross}$ on both local and cloud servers and perform comprehensive tests to validate that $\\mathsf{zkCross}$ is well-suited for processing large-scale privacy-preserving auditing tasks. We evaluate the performance of the proposed protocols in terms of run time, latency, throughput, gas consumption, audit time, and proof size to demonstrate their practicality.",

    "abstract": "As blockchain technology continues to transform the realm of digital transactions, scalability has emerged as a critical issue. This challenge has spurred the creation of innovative solutions, particularly Layer 2 scalability techniques like rollups. Among these, ZK-Rollups are notable for employing Zero-Knowledge Proofs to facilitate prompt on-chain transaction verification, thereby improving scalability and efficiency without sacrificing security. Nevertheless, the intrinsic complexity of ZK-Rollups has hindered an exhaustive evaluation of their efficiency, economic impact, and performance.\r\n\r\nThis paper offers a theoretical and empirical examination aimed at comprehending and evaluating ZK-Rollups, with particular attention to ZK-EVMs. We conduct a qualitative analysis to break down the costs linked to ZK-Rollups and scrutinize the design choices of well-known implementations. Confronting the inherent difficulties in benchmarking such intricate systems, we introduce a systematic methodology for their assessment, applying our method to two prominent ZK-Rollups: Polygon zkEVM and zkSync Era. Our research provides initial findings that illuminate trade-offs and areas for enhancement in ZK-Rollup implementations, delivering valuable insights for future research, development, and deployment of these systems.",

    "abstract": "Ring signatures, a cryptographic primitive introduced by Rivest, Shamir and Tauman (ASIACRYPT 2001), offer signer anonymity within dynamically formed user groups. Recent advancements have focused on lattice-based constructions to improve efficiency, particularly for large signing rings. However, current state-of-the-art solutions suffer from significant overhead, especially for smaller rings.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we present a novel NTRU-based ring signature scheme, Gandalf, tailored towards small rings. Our post-quantum scheme achieves a 50% reduction in signature sizes compared to the linear ring signature scheme Raptor (ACNS 2019). For rings of size two, our signatures are approximately a quarter the size of DualRing (CRYPTO 2021), another linear scheme, and remain more compact for rings up to size seven. Compared to the sublinear scheme Smile (CRYPTO 2021), our signatures are more compact for rings of up to 26. In particular, for rings of size two, our ring signatures are only 1236 bytes.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we explore the use of ring signatures to obtain deniability in authenticated key exchange mechanisms (AKEMs), the primitive behind the recent HPKE standard used in MLS and TLS. We take a fine-grained approach at formalising sender deniability within AKEM and seek to define the strongest possible notions. Our contributions extend to a black-box construction of a deniable AKEM from a KEM and a ring signature scheme for rings of size two. Our approach attains the highest level of confidentiality and authenticity, while simultaneously preserving the strongest forms of deniability in two orthogonal settings. Finally, we present parameter sets for our schemes, and show that our deniable AKEM, when instantiated with our ring signature scheme, yields ciphertexts of 2004 bytes.",

    "abstract": "Masking is one of the most popular countermeasures to protect implementations against power and electromagnetic side channel attacks, because it offers provable security. Masking has been shown secure against d-threshold probing adversaries by Ishai et al. at CRYPTO'03, but this adversary's model doesn't consider any physical hardware defaults and thus such masking schemes were shown to be still vulnerable when implemented as hardware circuits. To addressed these limitations glitch-extended probing adversaries and correspondingly glitch-immune masking schemes have been introduced. This paper introduces glitch-stopping circuits which, when instantiated with registers, coincide with circuits protected via glitch-immune masking. Then we show that one can instantiate glitch-stopping circuits without registers by using clocked logic gates or latches. This is illustrated for both ASIC and FPGA, offering a promising alternative to conventional register-based masked implementations. Compared to the traditional register-based approach, these register-free solutions can reduce the latency to a single cycle and achieve a lower area cost. We prove and experimentally confirm that the proposed solution is as secure as the register-based one. In summary, this paper proposes a novel method to address the latency of register-based hardware masking without jeopardising their security. This method not only reduces the latency down to one clock, but also improves the areas costs of the  implementations.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have exhibited an increase in applications that distribute trust across $n$ servers to protect user data from a central point of attack. However, these deployments remain limited due to a core obstacle: establishing $n$ distinct trust domains. An application provider, a single trust domain, cannot directly deploy multiple trust domains. As a result, application providers forge business relationships to enlist third-parties as trust domains, which is a manual, lengthy, and expensive process, inaccessible to many application developers. \r\n\r\nWe introduce the on-demand distributed-trust architecture that enables an application provider to deploy distributed trust automatically and immediately without controlling the other trust domains. The insight lies in reversing the deployment method such that each user's client drives deployment instead of the application provider. While at a first glance, this approach appears infeasible due to cost, performance, and resource abuse concerns, our system Flock resolves these challenges. We implement and evaluate Flock on 3 major cloud providers and 8 distributed-trust applications. On average, Flock achieves 1.05x the latency and 0.68-2.27x the cloud cost of a traditional distributed-trust deployment, without reliance on third-party relationships.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents quantum algorithms for fast correlation attacks, one of the most powerful techniques for cryptanalysis on LFSR-based stream ciphers in the classical setting.\r\nTypical fast correlation attacks recover a value related to the initial state of the underlying LFSR by solving a decoding problem on a binary linear code with the Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform (FWHT).\r\nApplying the FWHT on a function in the classical setting is mathematically equivalent to applying the Hadamard transform on the corresponding state in quantum computation.\r\nWhile the classical FWHT on a function with $\\ell$-bit inputs requires $O(\\ell 2^\\ell)$ operations, the Hadamard transform on $\\ell$-qubit states requires only a parallel application of $O(\\ell)$ basic gates.\r\nThis difference leads to the exponential speed-up by some quantum algorithms, including Simon's period finding algorithm.\r\n\r\nGiven these facts, the question naturally arises of whether a quantum speedup can also be achieved for fast correlations by replacing the classical FWHT with the quantum Hadamard transform.\r\nWe show quantum algorithms achieving speed-up in such a way, introducing a new attack model in the Q2 setting.\r\nThe new model endows adversaries with a quite strong power, but we demonstrate its feasibility by showing that certain members of the ChaCha and Salsa20 families will likely be secure in the new model.\r\nOur attack exploits the link between LFSRs' state update and multiplication in a fine field to apply Shor's algorithm for the discrete logarithm problem.\r\nWe apply our attacks on SNOW 2.0, SNOW 3G, and Sosemanuk, observing a large speed-up from classical attacks.",

    "abstract": "Multi-Key Homomorphic Signatures (MKHS) allow one to evaluate a function on data signed by distinct users while producing a succinct and publicly-verifiable certificate of the correctness of the result. All the constructions of MKHS in the state of the art achieve a weak level of succinctness where signatures are succinct in the total number of inputs but grow linearly with the number of users involved in the computation. The only exception is a SNARK-based construction which relies on a strong notion of knowledge soundness in the presence of signing oracles that not only requires non-falsifiable assumptions but also encounters some impossibility results.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we present the first construction of MKHS that are fully succinct (also with respect to the number of users) while achieving adaptive security under standard falsifiable assumptions. Our result is achieved through a novel combination of batch arguments for NP (BARGs) and functional commitments (FCs), and yields diverse MKHS instantiations for circuits of unbounded depth based on either pairing or lattice assumptions. Additionally, our schemes support efficient verification with pre-processing, and they can easily be extended to achieve multi-hop evaluation and context-hiding.",

    "abstract": "Threshold signatures enable any subgroup of predefined cardinality $t$ out of a committee of $n$ participants to generate a valid, aggregated signature. \r\nAlthough several $(t,n)$-threshold signature schemes exist, most of them assume that the threshold $t$ and the set of participants do not change over time. \r\nPractical applications of threshold signatures might benefit from the possibility of updating the threshold or the committee of participants. Examples of such applications are consensus algorithms and blockchain wallets.\r\nIn this paper, we present Dynamic-FROST (D-FROST, for short) that combines FROST, a Schnorr threshold signature scheme, with CHURP, a dynamic proactive secret sharing scheme. The resulting protocol is the first Schnorr threshold signature scheme that  accommodates changes in both the committee and the threshold value without relying on a trusted third party.\r\nBesides detailing the protocol, we present a proof of its security: as the original signing scheme, D-FROST preserves the property of Existential Unforgeability under Chosen-Message Attack.",

    "abstract": "Laconic function evaluation (LFE) allows us to compress a circuit $f$ into a short digest. Anybody can use this digest as a public-key to efficiently encrypt some input $x$. Decrypting the resulting ciphertext reveals the output $f(x)$, while hiding everything else about $x$.  In this work we consider LFE for Random-Access Machines (RAM-LFE) where, instead of a circuit $f$, we have a RAM program $f_{\\mathsf{DB}}$ that potentially contains some large hard-coded data $\\mathsf{DB}$. The decryption run-time to recover $f_{\\mathsf{DB}}(x)$ from the ciphertext should be roughly the same as a plain evaluation of $f_{\\mathsf{DB}}(x)$ in the RAM model, which can be sublinear in the size of $\\mathsf{DB}$. Prior works constructed LFE for circuits under LWE, and RAM-LFE under indisitinguishability obfuscation (iO) and Ring-LWE. In this work, we construct RAM-LFE with essentially optimal encryption and decryption run-times from just Ring-LWE and a standard circular security assumption, without iO. \r\n\r\nRAM-LFE directly yields 1-key succinct functional encryption and reusable garbling for RAMs with similar parameters. \r\n\r\nIf we only want an attribute-based LFE for RAMs  (RAM-AB-LFE), then we can replace Ring-LWE with plain LWE in the above. Orthogonally, if we only want leveled schemes, where the encryption/decryption efficiency can scale with the depth of the RAM computation, then we can remove the need for a circular-security. Lastly, we also get a leveled many-key attribute-based encryption for RAMs (RAM-ABE), from LWE.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the problem of detecting AI-generated text, we consider the problem of watermarking the output of language models with provable guarantees. We aim for watermarks which satisfy: (a) undetectability, a cryptographic notion introduced by Christ, Gunn & Zamir (2024) which stipulates that it is computationally hard to distinguish watermarked language model outputs from the model's actual output distribution; and (b) robustness to channels which introduce a constant fraction of adversarial insertions, substitutions, and deletions to the watermarked text. Earlier schemes could only handle stochastic substitutions and deletions, and thus we are aiming for a more natural and appealing robustness guarantee that holds with respect to edit distance.\r\n\r\nOur main result is a watermarking scheme which achieves both undetectability and robustness to edits when the alphabet size for the language model is allowed to grow as a polynomial in the security parameter. To derive such a scheme, we follow an approach introduced by Christ & Gunn (2024), which proceeds via first constructing pseudorandom codes satisfying undetectability and robustness properties analogous to those above; our key idea is to handle adversarial insertions and deletions by interpreting the symbols as indices into the codeword, which we call indexing pseudorandom codes. Additionally, our codes rely on weaker computational assumptions than used in previous work. Then we show that there is a generic transformation from such codes over large alphabets to watermarking schemes for arbitrary language models.",

    "abstract": "The notion of aggregate signatures allows for combining signatures from different parties into a short certificate that attests that *all* parties signed a message. In this work, we lift this notion to capture different, more expressive signing policies. For example, we can certify that a message was signed by a (weighted) threshold of signers. \r\n\r\nWe present the first constructions of aggregate signatures for monotone policies based on standard polynomial-time cryptographic assumptions. The aggregate signatures in our schemes are succinct, i.e., their size is *independent* of the number of signers. Moreover, verification is also succinct if all parties sign the same message (or if the messages have a succinct representation). All prior work requires either interaction between the parties or non-standard assumptions (that imply SNARKs for NP). \r\n\r\nOur signature schemes are based on non-interactive batch arguments (BARGs) for monotone policies [Brakerski-Brodsky-Kalai-Lombardi-Paneth, Crypto'23]. In contrast to previous constructions, our BARGs satisfy a new notion of *adaptive* security which is instrumental to our application. Our new BARGs for monotone policies can be constructed from standard BARGs and other standard assumptions.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing demand for Bluetooth devices, various Bluetooth devices support a power-saving mode to reduce power consumption. One of the features of the power-saving mode is that the Bluetooth sessions among devices are temporarily disconnected or close to being disconnected. Prior works have analyzed that the power-saving mode is vulnerable to denial of sleep (DoSL) attacks that interfere with the transition to the power-saving mode of Bluetooth devices, thereby increasing its power consumption. However, to the best of our knowledge, no prior work has analyzed vulnerabilities or attacks on the state after transitioning to the power-saving mode.\r\n\r\nTo address this issue, we present an attack that abuses two novel vulnerabilities in sleep mode, which is one of the Bluetooth power-saving modes, to break Bluetooth sessions. We name the attack Breaktooth. The attack is the first to abuse the vulnerabilities as an entry point to hijack Bluetooth sessions between victims. The attack also allows overwriting the link key between the victims using the hijacked session, enabling arbitrary command injection on the victims. Furthermore, while many prior attacks assume that attackers can forcibly disconnect the Bluetooth session using methods such as jamming to launch their attacks, our attack does not require such assumptions, making it more realistic.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present the root causes of the Breaktooth attack and their impact. We also provide the technical details of how attackers can secretly detect the sleep mode of their victims. The attackers can easily recognize the state of the victim's Bluetooth session remotely using a standard Linux command. Additionally, we develop a low-cost toolkit to perform our attack and confirm the effectiveness of our attack. Then, we evaluate the attack on 13 types of commodity Bluetooth keyboards and mice that support the sleep mode and show that the attack poses a serious threat to Bluetooth devices supporting the sleep mode. To fix our attack, we present defenses and its proof-of-concept. We responsibly disclosed our findings to the Bluetooth SIG.",

    "abstract": "The field of verifiable secret sharing schemes was introduced by Verheul et al. and has evolved over time, including well-known examples by Feldman and Pedersen. Stinson made advancements in combinatorial design-based secret sharing schemes in 2004. Desmedt et al. introduced the concept of frameproofness in 2021, while recent research by Sehrawat et al. in 2021 focuses on LWE-based access structure hiding verifiable secret sharing with malicious-majority settings. Furthermore, Roy et al. combined the concepts of reparable threshold schemes by Stinson et al. and frameproofness by Desmedt et al. in 2023, to develop extendable tensor designs built from balanced incomplete block designs, and also presented a frameproof version of their design.\r\nThis paper explores ramp-type verifiable secret sharing schemes, and the application of hidden access structures in such cryptographic protocols. Inspired by Sehrawat et al.'s access structure hiding scheme, we develop an $\\epsilon$-almost access structure hiding scheme, which is verifiable as well as frameproof. We detail how the concept $\\epsilon$-almost hiding is important for incorporating ramp schemes, thus making a fundamental generalisation of this concept.",

    "abstract": "Decentralized payments have evolved from using pseudonymous identifiers to much more elaborate mechanisms to ensure privacy. They can shield the amounts in payments and achieve untraceability, e.g., decoy-based untraceable payments use decoys to obfuscate the actual asset sender or asset receiver. There are two types of decoy-based payments:  full decoy set payments that use all other available users as decoys, e.g., Zerocoin, Zerocash, and ZCash, and  user-defined decoy set payments where the users select small decoy sets from available users, e.g., Monero, Zether, and QuisQuis. \r\n\r\nExisting decoy-based payments face at least two of the following problems: (1) degrading untraceability due to the possibility of payment-graph analysis in user-defined decoy payments, (2) trusted setup, (3) availability issues due to expiring transactions in full decoy sets and epochs, and (4) an ever-growing set of unspent outputs since transactions keep generating outputs without saying which ones are spent. QuisQuis is the first one to solve all these problems; however, QuisQuis requires large cryptographic proofs for validity. \r\n\r\nWe introduce Nopenena (means ``cannot see''): account-based, confidential, and user-defined decoy set payment protocol, that has short proofs and also avoids these four issues. Additionally, Nopenena can be integrated with zero-knowledge contracts like Zether's $\\Sigma-$Bullets and Confidential Integer Processing (CIP) to build decentralized applications. Nopenena payments are about 80% smaller than QuisQuis payments due to Nopenena's novel cryptographic protocol. Therefore, decentralized systems benefit from Nopenena's untraceability and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "A popular way to build post-quantum signature schemes is by first constructing an identification scheme (IDS) and applying the Fiat-Shamir transform to it. In this work we tackle two open questions related to the general applicability of techniques around this approach that together allow for efficient post-quantum signatures with optimal security bounds in the QROM. \r\n\r\nFirst we consider a recent work by Aguilar-Melchor, H\u00fclsing, Joseph, Majenz, Ronen, and Yue (Asiacrypt'23) that showed that an optimal bound for three-round commit & open IDS by Don, Fehr, Majenz, and Schaffner (Crypto'22) can be applied to the five-round Syndrome-Decoding in the Head (SDitH) IDS. For this, they first applied a transform that replaced the first three rounds by one. They left it as an open problem if the same approach applies to other schemes beyond SDitH. We answer this question in the affirmative, generalizing their round-elimination technique and giving a generic security proof for it. Our result applies to any IDS with $2n+1$ rounds for $n>1$. However, a scheme has to be suitable for the resulting bound to not be trivial. We find that IDS are suitable when they have a certain form of special-soundness which many commit & open IDS have.  \r\n\r\nSecond, we consider the hypercube technique by Aguilar-Melchor, Gama, Howe, H\u00fclsing, Joseph, and Yue (Eurocrypt'23). An optimization that was proposed in the context of SDitH and is now used by several of the contenders in the NIST signature on-ramp. It was conjectured that the technique applies generically for the MPC-in-the-Head (MPCitH) technique that is used in the design of many post-quantum IDS if they use an additive secret sharing scheme but this was never proven. In this work we show that the technique generalizes to MPCitH IDS that use an additively homomorphic MPC protocol, and we prove that security is preserved.        \r\n\r\nWe demonstrate the application of our results to the identification scheme of RYDE, a contender in the recent NIST signature on-ramp. While RYDE was already specified with the hypercube technique applied, this gives the first QROM proof for RYDE with an optimally tight bound.",

    "abstract": "We present an efficient quantum algorithm for solving the semidirect discrete logarithm problem (SDLP) in any finite group. The believed hardness of the semidirect discrete logarithm problem underlies more than a decade of works constructing candidate post-quantum cryptographic algorithms from nonabelian groups.  We use a series of reduction results to show that it suffices to consider SDLP in finite simple groups. We then apply the celebrated Classification of Finite Simple Groups to consider each family. The infinite families of finite simple groups admit, in a fairly general setting, linear algebraic attacks providing a reduction to the classical discrete logarithm problem.  For the sporadic simple groups, we show that their inherent properties render them unsuitable for cryptographically hard SDLP instances, which we illustrate via a Baby-Step Giant-Step style attack against SDLP in the Monster Group.\r\n\r\nOur quantum SDLP algorithm is fully constructive, up to the compu-\r\ntation of maximal normal subgroups, for all but three remaining cases that appear to be gaps in the literature on constructive recognition of groups; for these cases SDLP is no harder than finding a linear representation. We conclude that SDLP is not a suitable post-quantum hardness assumption for any choice of finite group.",

    "abstract": "Side channel attacks, and in particular timing attacks, are a fundamental obstacle to obtaining secure implementation of algorithms and cryptographic protocols, and have been widely researched for decades.\r\nWhile cryptographic definitions for the security of cryptographic systems have been well established for decades, none of these accepted definitions take into account the running time information leaked from executing the system.\r\nIn this work, we give the foundation of new cryptographic definitions for cryptographic systems that take into account information about their leaked running time, focusing mainly on keyed functions such as signature and encryption schemes. Specifically, \r\n\r\n(1) We define several cryptographic properties to express the claim that the timing information does not help an adversary to extract sensitive information, e.g. the key or the queries made. We highlight the definition of key-obliviousness, which means that an adversary cannot tell whether it received the timing of the queries with the actual key or the timing of the same queries with a random key. \r\n\r\n(2) We present a construction of  key-oblivious pseudorandom permutations on a small or medium-sized domain. This construction is not ``fixed-time,'' and at the same time is secure against any number of queries even in case the adversary knows the running time exactly. Our construction, which we call Janus Sometimes Recurse, is a variant of the ``Sometimes Recurse''  shuffle by Morris and Rogaway.\r\n\r\n(3) We suggest a new security notion for keyed functions, called noticeable security, and prove that cryptographic schemes that have noticeable security remain secure even when the exact timings are leaked, provided the implementation is key-oblivious. We show that our notion applies to cryptographic signatures, private key encryption and PRPs.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an optimization of the memory cost of the quantum Information Set Decoding (ISD) algorithm proposed by Bernstein (PQCrypto 2010), obtained by combining Prange's ISD with Grover's quantum search.\r\n\r\nWhen the code has constant rate and length $n$, this algorithm essentially performs a quantum search which, at each iteration, solves a linear system of dimension $\\mathcal{O}(n)$. The typical code lengths used in post-quantum public-key cryptosystems range from $10^3$ to $10^5$. Gaussian elimination, which was used in previous works, needs $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ space to represent the matrix, resulting in millions or billions of (logical) qubits for these schemes.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose instead to use the algorithm for sparse matrix inversion of Wiedemann (IEEE Trans. inf. theory 1986).  The interest of Wiedemann's method is that one relies only on the implementation of a matrix-vector product, where the matrix can be represented in an implicit way. This is the case here.\r\n\r\nWe give two main trade-offs, which we have fully implemented, tested on small instances, and benchmarked for larger instances. The first one is a quantum circuit using $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ qubits, $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ Toffoli gates like Gaussian elimination, and depth $\\mathcal{O}(n^2 \\log n)$. The second one is a quantum circuit using $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log^2 n)$ qubits, $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ gates in total but only $\\mathcal{O}( n^2 \\log^2 n)$ Toffoli gates, which relies on a different representation of the search space.\r\n\r\nAs an example, for the smallest Classic McEliece parameters we estimate that the Quantum Prange's algorithm can run with 18098 qubits, while previous works would have required at least half a million qubits.",

    "abstract": "One of the main issues to deal with for fully homomorphic encryption is the noise growth when operating on ciphertexts. To some extent, this can be controlled thanks to a so-called gadget decomposition. A gadget decomposition typically relies on radix- or CRT-based representations to split elements as vectors of smaller chunks whose inner products with the corresponding gadget vector rebuilds (an approximation of) the original elements. Radix-based gadget decompositions present the advantage of also supporting the approximate setting: for most homomorphic operations, this has a minor impact on the noise propagation but leads to substantial savings in bandwidth, memory requirements and computational costs. A typical use-case is the blind rotation as used for example in the bootstrapping of the TFHE scheme. On the other hand, CRT-based representations are convenient when machine words are too small for directly accommodating the arithmetic on large operands. This arises in two typical cases: (i) in the hardware case with multipliers of restricted size, e.g., 17 bits; (ii) in the software case for ciphertext moduli above, e.g., 128 bits.\r\n\r\nThis paper presents new CRT-based gadget decompositions for the approximate setting, which combines the advantages of non-exact decompositions with those of CRT-based decompositions.  Significantly, it enables certain hardware or software realizations otherwise hardly supported like the two aforementioned cases.  In particular, we show that our new gadget decompositions provide implementations of the (programmable) bootstrapping in TFHE relying solely on native arithmetic and offering extra degrees of parallelism.",

    "abstract": "$\\mathrm{SPHINCS^{+}}$ is a post-quantum signature scheme that, at the time of writing, is being standardized as $\\mathrm{SLH\\text{-}DSA}$. It is the most conservative option for post-quantum signatures, but the original tight proofs of security were flawed\u2014as reported by Kudinov, Kiktenko and Fedorov in 2020. In this work, we formally prove a tight security bound for $\\mathrm{SPHINCS^{+}}$ using the EasyCrypt proof assistant, establishing greater confidence in the general security of the scheme and that of the parameter sets considered for standardization. To this end, we reconstruct the tight security proof presented by H\u00fclsing and Kudinov (in 2022) in a modular way. A small but important part of this effort involves a complex argument relating four different games at once, of a form not yet formalized in EasyCrypt (to the best of our knowledge). We describe our approach to overcoming this major challenge, and develop a general formal verification technique aimed at this type of reasoning.\r\nEnhancing the set of reusable EasyCrypt artifacts previously produced in the formal verification of stateful hash-based cryptographic constructions, we (1) improve and extend the existing libraries for hash functions and (2) develop new libraries for fundamental concepts related to hash-based cryptographic constructions, including Merkle trees. These enhancements, along with the formal verification technique we develop, further ease future formal verification endeavors in EasyCrypt, especially those concerning hash-based cryptographic constructions.",

    "abstract": "Cryptographic hash functions are said to be the work-horses of modern cryptography. One of the strongest approaches to assess a cryptographic hash function's security is indifferentiability. Informally, indifferentiability measures to what degree the function resembles a random oracle when instantiated with an ideal underlying primitive. However, proving the indifferentiability security of hash functions has been challenging due to complex simulator designs and proof arguments. The Sponge construction is one of the prevalent hashing method used in various systems. The Sponge has been shown to be indifferentiable from a random oracle when initialized with a random permutation. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we first introduce $\\mathsf{GSponge}$, a generalized form of the Sponge construction offering enhanced flexibility in input chaining, field sizes, and padding types. $\\mathsf{GSponge}$ not only captures all existing sponge variants but also unveils new, efficient ones. The generic structure of $\\mathsf{GSponge}$ facilitates the discovery of two micro-optimizations for already deployed sponges. Firstly, it allows a new padding rule based on zero-padding and domain-separated inputs, saving one full permutation call in certain cases without increasing the generation time of zero-knowledge proofs. Secondly, it allows to absorb up to $\\mathsf{c}/2$ more elements (that can save another permutation call for certain message lengths) without compromising the indifferentiability security. These optimizations enhance hashing time for practical use cases such as Merkle-tree hashing and short message processing. \r\n\r\nWe then propose a new efficient instantiation of $\\mathsf{GSponge}$ called $\\mathsf{Sponge2}$ capturing these micro-optimizations and provide a formal indifferentiability proof to establish both $\\mathsf{Sponge2}$ and $\\mathsf{GSponge}$'s security. This proof, simpler than the original for Sponges, offers clarity and ease of understanding for real-world practitioners. Additionally, it is demonstrated that $\\mathsf{GSponge}$ can be safely instantiated with permutations defined over large prime fields, a result not previously formally proven.",

    "abstract": "In the useful and well studied model of secret-sharing schemes, there are $n$ parties and a dealer, which holds a secret. The dealer applies some randomized algorithm to the secret, resulting in $n$ strings, called shares; it gives the $i$'th share to the $i$'th party. There are two requirements. (1) correctness: some predefined subsets of the parties can jointly reconstruct the secret from their shares, and (2) security: any other set gets no information on the secret. The collection of predefined qualified sets is called an access structure (AS).\r\n\r\nThis model assumes that the number of parties is known when preparing the shares and giving the shares to the parties; furthermore, the sharing algorithm and the share size are determined by the number of parties, e.g. in the best-known \r\nsecret-sharing scheme for an arbitrary $n$-party access structure the share size is $1.5^{n}$ by Appelbaum and Nir. \r\n\r\nThe assumption that the number of parties is known in advance is problematic in many scenarios. Of course, one can take some upper bound on the number of parties. On one hand, if this bound is big, then the share size will be large even if only few parties actually participate in the scheme.   On the other hand, if this bound is small, then there is a  risk that too many parties will arrive and no further shares can be produced; this will require an expensive re-sharing of the secret and updating all shares (which can be impossible if some parties are temporally off-line). Thus, we need to consider models with an unbounded number of parties. \r\n\r\nTo address these concrens, Komargodski, Naor, and Yogev defined \\emph{evolving secret-sharing schemes} with an unbounded number of parties. In a nutshell, evolving AS's are defined as a monotone\r\ncollection of finite qualified sets, such that at any time $t$ a set $A\\subseteq [t]$ is either qualified or not, depending only on $A$ itself, and not on $t$ (a `global' monotonicity notion).\r\n\r\nQuantum secret sharing (QSS) in the standard $n$-party setting, where the secret is an arbitrary quantum state (say, qbit), rather than classical data. In face of recent advancements in quantum computing, this is a natural notion to consider, and has been studied before.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we explore the natural notion of quantum evolving secret sharing (QESS). While this notion has been studied by Samadder 20', we make several new contributions.\r\n(1) The notion of QESS was only implicit in the above work. We formalize this notion (as well as AS's for which it is applicable), and in particular argue that the variant implied by the above work did not require `global monotonicity' of the AS, which was the standard in the evolving secret sharing literature, and appears to be useful for QESS as well.\r\n(2) Discuss the applicability and limitations of the notion in the quantum setting that follow from the no-cloning theorem, and make its usability more limited. Yet, we argue that fundamental advantages of the evovling setting, such as keeping parties' shares independent of the total number of parties that arrive can be mantainted in the quantum setting.\r\n(3) We characterize the AS's ammenable to construction of QSSS - so called `no cloning' evolving AS's, and point out that this class is not severly restricted relatively to the class of all evolving AS's. On the positive side, our construction combines the compiler of [Smith 00'] with ideas of hybrid secret sharing of [Goyal et. al 23'], to obtain a construction with share size comparable to the best classical linear share complexity of the scheme.",

    "abstract": "There has been significant progress over the past seven years in model reverse engineering (RE) for neural network (NN) hardware. Although there has been systematization of knowledge (SoK) in an overall sense, however, the treatment from the hardware perspective has been far from adequate. To bridge this gap, this paper systematically categorizes the types of NN hardware used prevalently by the industry/academia, and also the model RE attacks/defenses published in each category. Further, we sub-categorize existing NN model RE attacks based on different criteria including the degree of hardware parallelism, threat vectors like side channels, fault-injection, scan-chain attacks, system-level attacks, type of asset under attack, the type of NN, exact versus approximate recovery, etc.\r\n\r\nWe make important technical observations and identify key open research directions. Subsequently, we discuss the state-of-the-art defenses against NN model RE, identify certain categorization criteria, and compare the existing works based on these criteria. We note significant qualitative gaps for defenses, and suggest recommendations for important open research directions for protection of NN models. Finally, we discuss limitations of existing work in terms of the types of models where security evaluation or defenses were proposed, and suggest open problems in terms of protecting practically expensive model IPs.",

    "abstract": "End-to-End (E2E) encrypted messaging, which prevents even the service provider from learning communication contents, is gaining popularity. Since users care about maintaining access to their data even if their devices are lost or broken or just replaced, these systems are often paired with cloud backup solutions: Typically, the user will encrypt their messages with a fixed key, and upload the ciphertexts to the server. Unfortunately, this naive solution has many drawbacks. First, it often undermines the fancy security guarantees of the core application, such as forward secrecy (FS) and post-compromise security (PCS), in case the single backup key is compromised. Second, they are wasteful for backing up conversations in large groups, where many users are interested in backing up the same sequence of messages. \r\n\r\nInstead, we formalize a new primitive called Compact Key Storage (CKS) as the \"right\" solution to this problem. Such CKS scheme allows a mutable set of parties to delegate to a server storage of an increasing set of keys, while each client maintains only a small state. Clients update their state as they learn new keys (maintaining PCS), or whenever they want to forget keys (achieving FS), often without the need to interact with the server. Moreover, access to the keys (or some subset of them) can be efficiently delegated to new group members, who all efficiently share the same server's storage. \r\n\r\nWe carefully define syntax, correctness, privacy, and integrity of CKS schemes, and build two efficient schemes provably satisfying these notions. Our line scheme covers the most basic \"all-or-nothing\" flavor of CKS, where one wishes to compactly store and delegate the entire history of past secrets. Thus, new users enjoy the efficiency and compactness properties of the CKS only after being granted access to the entire history of keys. In contrast, our interval scheme is only slightly less efficient but allows for finer-grained access, delegation, and deletion of past keys.",

    "abstract": "For more than forty years, two principal questions have been asked when designing verifiable election systems: how will the integrity of the results be demonstrated and how will the privacy of votes be preserved? Many approaches have been taken towards answering the first question such as use of MixNets and homomorphic tallying. But in the academic literature, the second question has always been answered in the same way: decryption capabilities are divided amongst multiple independent \u201ctrustees\u201d so that a collusion is required to compromise privacy.\r\n\r\nIn practice, however, this approach can be fairly challenging to deploy. Human trustees rarely have a clear understanding of their responsibilities, and they typically all use identical software for their tasks. Rather than exercising independent judgment to maintain privacy, trustees are often reduced to automata who just push the buttons they are told to when they are told to, doing little towards protecting voter privacy. This paper looks at several aspects of the trustee experience. It begins by discussing various cryptographic protocols that have been used for key generation in elections, explores their impact on the role of trustees, and notes that even the theory of proper use of trustees is more challenging than it might seem. This is illustrated by showing that one of the only references defining a full threshold distributed key generation (DKG) for elections defines an insecure protocol. Belenios claims to rely on that reference for its DKG and security proof. Fortunately, it does not inherit the same vulnerability. We offer a security proof for the Belenios DKG. \r\n\r\nThe paper then discusses various practical contexts, in terms of humans, software, and hardware, and their impact on the practical deployment of a trustee-based privacy model.",

    "abstract": "Shortening the argument (three group elements or 1536 / 3072 bits over the BLS12-381/BLS24-509 curves) of the Groth16 zk-SNARK for R1CS is a long-standing open problem.  We propose a zk-SNARK Polymath for the Square Arithmetic Programming constraint system using the KZG polynomial commitment scheme.  Polymath has a shorter argument (1408 / 1792 bits over the same curves) than Groth16.  At 192-bit security, Polymath's argument is nearly half the size, making it highly competitive for high-security future applications.  Notably, we handle public inputs in a simple way.  We optimized Polymath's prover through an exhaustive parameter search. Polymath's prover does not output $\\mathbb{G}_{2}$ elements, aiding in batch verification, SNARK aggregation, and recursion.  Polymath's properties make it highly suitable to be the final SNARK in SNARK compositions.",

Decryption of a ciphertext for $\\vec{x}$ is allowed by a key for $\\vec{y}$ if and only if the inner product $\\langle{\\vec{x}},{\\vec{y}}\\rangle \\neq 0$.  \r\nExisting constructions of NIPE assume the length of the vectors are fixed apriori.   \r\nWe present the first constructions of $ unbounded $ non-zero inner product encryption (UNIPE) with constant sized keys. Unbounded here refers to the size of vectors not being pre-fixed during setup. Both constructions, based on bilinear maps, are proven selectively secure under the decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption.\r\n\r\nOur constructions are obtained by transforming the unbounded inner product functional encryption (IPFE) schemes of Dufour-Sans and Pointcheval (ACNS 2019), one in the $strict ~ domain$ setting and the other in the $permissive ~ domain$ setting. Interestingly, in the latter case, we prove security from DBDH, a static assumption while the original IPE scheme relied on an interactive parameterised assumption. In terms of efficiency, features of the IPE constructions are retrained after transformation to NIPE. Notably, the public key and decryption keys have constant size.",

    "abstract": "We analyse the cryptographic protocols underlying Delta Chat, a decentralised messaging application which uses e-mail infrastructure for message delivery. It provides end-to-end encryption by implementing the Autocrypt standard and the SecureJoin protocols, both making use of the OpenPGP standard. Delta Chat's adoption by categories of high-risk users such as journalists and activists, but also more generally users in regions affected by Internet censorship, makes it a target for powerful adversaries. Yet, the security of its protocols has not been studied to date. We describe five new attacks on Delta Chat in its own threat model, exploiting cross-protocol interactions between its implementation of SecureJoin and Autocrypt, as well as bugs in rPGP, its OpenPGP library. The findings have been disclosed to the Delta Chat team, who implemented fixes.",

    "abstract": "We show that the smallness of message spaces can be used as a checksum allowing to hedge against CCA1 attacks in additively homomorphic encryption schemes. We first show that the additively homomorphic variant of Damg\u00e5rd's Elgamal provides IND-CCA1 security under the standard DDH assumption. Earlier proofs either required non-standard assumptions or only applied to hybrid versions of Damg\u00e5rd's Elgamal, which are not additively homomorphic. Our security proof builds on hash proof systems and exploits the fact that encrypted messages must be contained in a polynomial-size interval in order to enable decryption. With $3$ group elements per ciphertext, this positions Damg\u00e5rd's Elgamal as the most efficient/compact DDH-based additively homomorphic CCA1 cryptosystem. Under the same assumption, the best candidate so far was the lite Cramer-Shoup cryptosystem, where ciphertexts consist of $4$ group elements. We extend this observation to build an IND-CCA1 variant of the Boneh-Goh-Nissim encryption scheme, which allows evaluating 2-DNF formulas on encrypted data. By computing tensor products of Damg\u00e5rd's Elgamal ciphertexts, we obtain product ciphertexts consisting of $9$ group elements (instead of $16$ elements if we were tensoring lite Cramer-Shoup ciphertexts) in the target group of a bilinear map. Using similar ideas, we also obtain a CCA1 variant of the Elgamal-Paillier cryptosystem by forcing $\\lambda$ plaintext bits to be zeroes, which yields CCA1 security almost for free. In particular, the message space remains exponentially large and ciphertexts are as short as in the IND-CPA scheme. We finally adapt the technique to the Castagnos-Laguillaumie system.",

    "abstract": "Private Set Union (PSU) protocol allows parties, each holding an input set, to jointly compute the union of the sets without revealing anything else. In the literature, scalable PSU protocols follow the \u201csplit-execute-assemble\u201d paradigm (Kolesnikov et al., ASIACRYPT 2019); in addition, those fast protocols often use Oblivious Transfer as building blocks. Kolesnikov et al. (ASIACRYPT 2019) and Jia et al. (USENIX Security 2022), pointed out that certain security issues can be introduced in the \u201csplit-execute-assemble\u201d paradigm. In this work, surprisingly, we observe that the typical way of invoking Oblivious Transfer also causes unnecessary leakage, and only the PSU protocols based on additively homomorphic encryption (AHE) can avoid the leakage. However, the AHE-based PSU protocols are far from being practical.\r\n\r\nTo bridge the gap, we also design a new PSU protocol that can avoid the unnecessary leakage. Unlike the AHE-based PSU protocols, our new construction only relies on symmetric-key operations other than base OTs, thereby being much more scalable. The experimental results demonstrate that our protocol can obtain at least 873.74\u00d7 speedup over the best-performing AHE-based scheme. Moreover, our performance is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art PSU protocol (Chen et al., USENIX Security 2023), which also suffers from the unnecessary leakage.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces and develops the concept of ``ticketing'', through which atomic broadcasts are orchestrated by nodes in a distributed system. The paper studies different ticketing regimes that allow parallelism, yet prevent slow nodes from hampering overall progress. It introduces a hybrid scheme which combines managed and unmanaged ticketing regimes, striking a balance between adaptivity and resilience. The performance evaluation demonstrates how managed and unmanaged ticketing regimes benefit throughput in systems with heterogeneous resources both in static and dynamic scenarios, with the managed ticketing regime performing better among the two as it adapts better. Finally, it demonstrates how using the hybrid ticketing regime performance can enjoy both the adaptivity of the managed regime and the liveness guarantees of the unmanaged regime.",

    "abstract": "We revisit the question of relating the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) between ordinary elliptic curves over finite fields with the same number of points. This problem was considered in 1999 by Galbraith and in 2005 by Jao, Miller, and Venkatesan. We apply recent results from isogeny cryptography and cryptanalysis, especially the Kani construction, to this problem. We improve the worst case bound in Galbraith's 1999 paper from $\\tilde{O}( q^{1.5} )$ to (heuristically) $\\tilde{O}( q^{0.4} )$ operations.\r\n\r\nThe two cases of main interest for discrete logarithm cryptography are random curves (flat volcanoes) and pairing-based crypto (tall volcanoes with crater of constant or polynomial size). In both cases we show a rigorous $\\tilde{O}( q^{1/4})$ algorithm to compute an isogeny between any two curves in the isogeny class. We stress that this paper is motivated by pre-quantum elliptic curve cryptography using ordinary elliptic curves, which is not yet obsolete.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel approach to small area and low-latency first-order masking in hardware. The core idea is to separate the processing of shares in time in order to achieve non-completeness. Resulting circuits are proven first-order glitch-extended PINI secure. This means the method can be straightforwardly applied to mask arbitrary functions without constraints which the designer must take care of. Furthermore we show that an implementation can benefit from optimization through EDA tools without sacrificing security. We provide concrete results of several case studies. Our low-latency implementation of a complete PRINCE core shows a 32% area improvement (44% with optimization) over the state-of-the-art. Our PRINCE S-Box passes formal verification with a tool and the complete core on FPGA shows no first-order leakage in TVLA with 100 million traces. Our low-latency implementation of the AES S-Box costs roughly one third (one quarter with optimization) of the area of state-of-the-art implementations. It shows no first-order leakage in TVLA with 250 million traces.",

    "abstract": "Vote-by-mail is increasingly used in Europe and worldwide for government elections. Nevertheless, very few attempts have been made towards the design of verifiable vote-by-mail, and none of them come with a rigorous security analysis. Furthermore, the ballot privacy of the currently deployed (non-verifiable) vote-by-mail systems relies on procedural means that a single malicious operator can bypass.\r\n\r\nWe propose a verifiable vote-by-mail system that can accommodate the constraints of many of the large ballots that are common in Europe. Verifiability and privacy hold unless multiple system components collude to cheat on top of the postal channel. These security notions are expressed and analyzed in the simplified UC security framework.\r\n\r\nOur vote-by-mail system only makes limited requirements on the voters: voters can verify their vote by copying and comparing short strings and verifying the computation of a single hash on a short input, and they can vote normally if they want to ignore the verification steps completely. Our system also relies on common cryptographic components, all available in the ElectionGuard verifiable voting SDK for instance, which limits the risks of errors in the implementation of the cryptographic aspects of the system.",

    "abstract": "The current cryptographic frameworks like RSA, ECC, and AES are potentially under quantum threat. Quantum cryptographic and post-quantum cryptography are being extensively researched for securing future information. The quantum computer and quantum algorithms are still in the early developmental stage and thus lack scalability for practical application. As a result of these challenges, most researched PQC  methods are lattice-based, code-based, ECC isogeny, hash-based, and multivariate crypto schemes. In this paper, we explore other athematical topics such as stereographic projection, Mobius transformation, change of basis, Apollonian circle, Binary Quadratic form equivalence, Gauss composition law, and its conjunctions. It fulfills preliminary conditions like bijection, primality, and np-hard problems, and the feasibility of one-way functions along with its interconnection. Thus allowing the exploration of new realms of mathematics for the development of secure protocols for future communication.",

    "abstract": "Message Authentication Codes (MACs) are ubiquitous primitives deployed in multiple flavors through standards such as HMAC, CMAC, GMAC, LightMAC, and many others. Its versatility makes it an essential building block in applications necessitating message authentication and integrity checks, in authentication protocols, authenticated encryption schemes, or as a pseudorandom or key derivation function. Its usage in this variety of settings makes it susceptible to a broad range of attack scenarios. The latest attack trends leverage a lack of commitment or context-discovery security in AEAD schemes and these attacks are mainly due to the weakness in the underlying MAC part. However, these new attack models have been scarcely analyzed for MACs themselves. This paper provides a thorough treatment of MACs committing and context-discovery security. We reveal that commitment and context-discovery security of MACs have their own interest by highlighting real-world vulnerable scenarios. We formalize the required security notions for MACs, and analyze the security of standardized MACs for these notions. Additionally, as a constructive application, we analyze generic AEAD composition and provide simple and efficient ways to build committing and context-discovery secure AEADs.",

    "abstract": "We consider constructions that combine outputs of a single permutation $\\pi:\\{0,1\\}^n \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}^n$ using a public function. These are popular constructions for achieving security beyond the birthday bound when implementing a pseudorandom function using a block cipher (i.e., a pseudorandom permutation). One of the best-known constructions (denoted SXoP$[2,n]$) XORs the outputs of 2 domain-separated calls to $\\pi$.\r\n\r\nModeling $\\pi$ as a uniformly chosen permutation, several previous works proved a tight information-theoretic indistinguishability bound for SXoP$[2,n]$ of about $q/2^{n}$, where $q$ is the number of queries. On the other hand, tight bounds are unknown for the generalized variant (denoted SXoP$[r,n]$) which XORs the outputs of $r>2$ domain-separated calls to a uniform permutation. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we obtain two results. Our first result improves the known bounds for SXoP$[r,n]$ for all (constant) $r \\geq 3$ (assuming $q \\leq O(2^n/r)$ is not too large) in both the single-user and multi-user settings. In particular, for $q=3$, our bound is about $\\sqrt{u}q_{\\max}/2^{2.5n}$ (where $u$ is the number of users and $q_{\\max}$ is the maximal number of queries per user), improving the best-known previous result by a factor of at least $2^n$. \r\n\r\nFor odd $r$, our bounds are tight for $q > 2^{n/2}$, as they match known attacks. For even $r$, we prove that our single-user bounds are tight by providing matching attacks.\r\n\r\nOur second and main result is divided into two parts. First, we devise a family of constructions that output $n$ bits by efficiently combining outputs of 2 calls to a permutation on $\\{0,1\\}^n$, and achieve multi-user security of about $\\sqrt{u} q_{\\max}/2^{1.5n}$. Then, inspired by the CENC construction of Iwata [FSE'06], we further extend this family to output $2n$ bits by efficiently combining outputs of 3 calls to a permutation on $\\{0,1\\}^n$. The extended construction has similar multi-user security of $\\sqrt{u} q_{\\max}/2^{1.5n}$.\r\n\r\nThe new single-user ($u=1$) bounds of $q/2^{1.5n}$ for both families should be contrasted with the previously best-known bounds of $q/2^n$, obtained by the comparable constructions of SXoP$[2,n]$ and CENC. \r\n\r\nAll of our bounds are proved by Fourier analysis, extending the provable security toolkit in this domain in multiple ways.",

    "abstract": "We revisit the problem of private information retrieval (PIR) in the shuffle model, where queries can be made anonymously by multiple clients. We present the first single-server PIR protocol in this model that has sublinear per-client communication and information-theoretic security. Moreover, following one-time preprocessing on the server side, our protocol only requires sublinear per-client computation. Concretely, for every $\\gamma>0$, the protocol has $O(n^{\\gamma})$ communication and computation costs per (stateless) client, with $1/\\text{poly}(n)$ statistical security, assuming that a size-$n$ database is simultaneously accessed by $\\text{poly}(n)$ clients. This should be contrasted with the recent breakthrough result of Lin, Mook, and Wichs (STOC 2023) on doubly efficient PIR in the standard model,  which is (inherently) limited to computational security.",

Today, we have multiple approaches to design fully homomorphic signatures such as from lattices, or succinct functional commitments, or indistinguishability obfuscation, or mutable batch arguments.

We do not have homomorphic signatures with features such as multi-hop evaluation, context hiding, and fast amortized verification, while relying on standard falsifiable assumptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this work, we design homomorphic signatures satisfying all above properties. We construct homomorphic signatures for polynomial-sized circuits from a variety of standard assumptions such as sub-exponential DDH, standard pairing-based assumptions, or learning with errors. We also discuss how our constructions can be easily extended to the multi-key setting.",

While CISE is widely used to develop security solutions, side-channel analysis of CISE-based devices is in its infancy. Specifically, it is important to evaluate whether the power usage and electromagnetic emissions of CISE-based devices have any correlation with its internal operations, which an adversary can exploit to deduce cryptographic secrets. \r\nIn this paper, we propose a test vector leakage assessment framework to evaluate the pre-silicon prototypes at the early stages of the design life-cycle. Specifically, we first identify functional units with the potential for leaking information through power side-channel signatures and then evaluate them on system prototypes by generating the necessary firmware to maximize the side-channel signature. Our experimental results on two RISC-V based cryptographic extensions, RISCV-CRYPTO and XCRYPTO, demonstrated that seven out of eight prototype AES- and SHA-related functional units are vulnerable to leaking cryptographic secrets through their power side-channel signature even in full system mode with a statistical significance of $\\alpha = 0.05$.",

    "abstract": "In this work we first present an explicit forking lemma that distills the information-theoretic essence of the high-moment technique introduced by Rotem and Segev (CRYPTO '21), who analyzed the security of identification protocols and Fiat-Shamir signature schemes. Whereas the technique of Rotem and Segev was particularly geared towards two specific cryptographic primitives, we present a stand-alone probabilistic lower bound, which does not involve any underlying primitive or idealized model. The key difference between our lemma and previous ones is that instead of focusing on the tradeoff between the worst-case or expected running time of the resulting forking algorithm and its success probability, we focus on the tradeoff between higher moments of its running time and its success probability. \r\n \r\nEquipped with our lemma, we then establish concrete security bounds for the BN and BLS multi-signature schemes that are significantly tighter than the concrete security bounds established by  Bellare and Neven (CCS '06) and Boneh, Drijvers and Neven (ASIACRYPT '18), respectively. Our analysis does not limit adversaries to any idealized algebraic model, such as the algebraic group model in which all algorithms are assumed to provide an algebraic justification for each group element they produce. Our bounds are derived in the random-oracle model based on the standard-model second-moment hardness of the discrete logarithm problem (for the BN scheme) and the computational co-Diffie-Hellman problem (for the BLS scheme). Such second-moment assumptions, asking that the success probability of any algorithm in solving the underlying computational problems is dominated by the second moment of the algorithm's running time, are particularly plausible in any group where no better-than-generic algorithms are currently known.",

    "abstract": "A common drawback of secure vector summation protocols in the single-server model is that they impose at least one synchronization point between all clients contributing to the aggregation. This results in clients waiting on each other to advance through the rounds of the protocol, leading to large latency (or failures due to too many dropouts) even if the protocol is computationally efficient. In this paper we propose protocols in the single-server model where clients contributing data to the aggregation (i) send a single message to the server and (ii) can join aggregation sessions dynamically whenever they have resources, i.e., without  the need for synchronizing their reporting time with any other clients. Our approach is based on a committee of parties that aid in the computation by running a setup phase before data collection starts, and a verification/decryption phase once it ends. Unlike existing committee-based protocols such as Flamingo (S\\&P 2023), the cost for committee members can be made sub-linear in the number of clients, and does not depend on the size of the input client vectors. Our experimental evaluation shows that our protocol, even while allowing dynamic client participation, is competitive with the state of the art protocols that do not have that feature in both computation and communication.",

    "abstract": "Distributed Point Function (DPF) provides a way for a dealer to split a point function $f_{\\alpha, \\beta}$ into multiple succinctly described function-shares, where  the function $f_{\\alpha, \\beta}$ for a special input $\\alpha$, returns a special output value $\\beta$, and returns a fixed value $0$ otherwise. As the security requirement, any strict subset of the function-shares reveals nothing about the function $f_{\\alpha,\\beta}$. However, each function-share can be individually evaluated on the common input $x$, and these evaluation results can then be merged together to reconstruct the value $f_{\\alpha, \\beta}(x)$. \r\n\r\nRecently, Servan-Schreiber et al. (S&P 2023) investigate the access control problem for  DPF; namely, the DPF evaluators can ensure that the DPF dealer is authorized to share the given function with privacy assurance. In this work, we revisit this problem, introducing a new notion called DPF with constraints; meanwhile, we identify that there exists a subtle flaw in their privacy definition as well as a soundness issue in one of their proposed schemes due to the lack of validation of the special output value $\\beta$. Next, we show how to reduce both the storage size of the constraint representation and the server's computational overhead from $O(N)$ to $O(\\log N)$, where $N$ is the number of authorized function sets. In addition, we show how to achieve fine-grained private access control, that is, the wildcard-style constraint for the choice of the special output $\\beta$. Our benchmarks show that the amortized running time of our logarithmic storage scheme is $2\\times$ - $3\\times$ faster than the state-of-the-art when $N=2^{15}$. Furthermore, we provide the first impossibility and feasibility results of the DPF with constraints where the evaluators do not need to communicate with each other.",

    "abstract": "In past years, entire research communities have arisen to address concerns of privacy and fairness in data analysis. At present, however, the public must trust that institutions will re-implement algorithms voluntarily to account for these social concerns. Due to additional cost, widespread adoption is unlikely without effective legal enforcement. A technical challenge for enforcement is that the methods proposed are often probabilistic mechanisms, whose output must be drawn according to precise, and sometimes secret, distributions. The Differential Privacy (DP) case is illustrative: if a cheating curator answers queries according to an overly-accurate mechanism, privacy violations could go undetected. The need for effective enforcement raises the central question of our paper: Can we efficiently certify the output of a probabilistic mechanism enacted by an untrusted party? To this end:\r\n\r\n(1) We introduce two new notions: Certified  Probabilistic Mechanisms (CPM) and Random Variable Commitment Schemes (RVCS). A CPM is an interactive protocol that forces a prover to enact a given probabilistic mechanism or be caught; importantly, the interaction does not reveal secret parameters of the mechanism. An RVCS\u2014a key primitive for constructing CPMs\u2014is a commitment scheme where the verifier is convinced that the commitment is to an RV sampled according to an agreed-upon distribution, but learns nothing else.\r\n\r\n(2) We instantiate the general notion of CPM for the special case of  Certifying DP. We build a lightweight, doubly-efficent interactive proof system to certify arbitrary-predicate counting queries released via the DP Binomial mechanism. The construction relies on a commitment scheme with perfect hiding and additive homomorphic properties that can be used to release a broad class of queries about a committed database, which we construct on top of Pedersen commitments. \r\n\r\n(3) Finally, we demonstrate the immediate feasibility of Certified DP via a highly-efficient and scalable prototype implementation to answer counting queries of arbitrary predicates. The mechanism is composed of an offline and online stage, where the online phase allows for non-interactive certification of queries. For example, we show that CDP queries over a US Census Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) ($n=7000$) can be completed in only 1.6 ms and verified in just 38 $\\mu \\text{s}$.

    "abstract": "Collaborative zk-SNARK (USENIX'22) allows multiple parties to jointly create a zk-SNARK proof over distributed secrets (also known as the witness). It provides a promising approach to proof outsourcing, where a client wishes to delegate the tedious task of proof generation to many servers from different locations, while ensuring no corrupted server can learn its witness (USENIX'23). Unfortunately, existing work remains a significant efficiency problem, as the protocols rely heavily on a particularly powerful server, and thus face challenges in achieving scalability for complex applications.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we address this problem by extending the existing zk-SNARKs Libra (Crypto'19) and HyperPlonk (Eurocrypt'23) into scalable collaborative zk-SNARKs. Crucially, our collaborative proof generation does not require a powerful server, and all servers take up roughly the same proportion of the total workload. In this way, we achieve privacy and scalability simultaneously for the first time in proof outsourcing. To achieve this, we develop an efficient MPC toolbox for a number of useful multivariate polynomial primitives, including sumcheck, productcheck, and multilinear polynomial commitment, which can also be applied to other applications as independent interests. For proof outsourcing purposes, when using $128$ servers to jointly generate a proof for a circuit size of $2^{24}$ gates, our benchmarks for these two collaborative proofs show a speedup of $21\\times$ and $24\\times$ compared to a local prover, respectively. Furthermore, we are able to handle enormously large circuits, making it practical for real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "The trading of data is becoming increasingly important as it holds substantial value. A blockchain-based data marketplace can provide a secure and transparent platform for data exchange. To facilitate this, developing a fair data exchange protocol for digital goods has garnered considerable attention in recent decades. The Zero Knowledge Contingent Payment (ZKCP) protocol enables trustless fair exchanges with the aid of blockchain and zero-knowledge proofs. However, applying this protocol in a practical data marketplace is not trivial.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, several potential attacks are identified when applying the ZKCP protocol in a practical public data marketplace. To address these issues, we propose SmartZKCP, an enhanced solution that offers improved security measures and increased performance. The protocol is formalized to ensure fairness and secure against potential attacks. Moreover, SmartZKCP offers efficiency optimizations and minimized communication costs. Evaluation results show that SmartZKCP is both practical and efficient, making it applicable in a data exchange marketplace.",

    "abstract": "Secure Aggregation (SA) stands as a crucial component in modern Federated Learning (FL) systems, facilitating collaborative training of a global machine learning model while protecting the privacy of individual clients' local datasets. Many existing SA protocols described in the FL literature operate synchronously, leading to notable runtime slowdowns due to the presence of stragglers (i.e. late-arriving clients).\r\nTo address this challenge, one common approach is to consider stragglers as client failures and use SA solutions that are robust against dropouts. While this approach indeed seems to work, it unfortunately affects the performance of the protocol as its cost strongly depends on the dropout ratio and this ratio has increased significantly when taking stragglers into account. \r\nAnother approach explored in the literature to address stragglers is to introduce asynchronicity into the FL system. Very few SA solutions exist in this setting and currently suffer from high overhead.\r\nIn this paper, similar to related work, we propose to handle stragglers as client failures but design SA solutions that do not depend on the dropout ratio so that an unavoidable increase on this metric does not affect the performance of the solution. We first introduce Eagle, a synchronous SA scheme designed not to depend on the client failures but on the online users' inputs only. This approach offers better computation and communication costs compared to existing solutions under realistic settings where the number of stragglers is high. We then propose Owl, the first SA solution that is suitable for the asynchronous setting and once again considers online clients' contributions only.\r\n We implement both solutions and show that: (i) in a synchronous FL with realistic dropout rates (taking potential stragglers into account), Eagle outperforms the best SA solution, namely Flamingo, by X4; (ii) In the asynchronous setting, Owl exhibits the best performance compared to the state-of-the-art solution LightSecAgg.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce a primitive called a dual polynomial commitment scheme that allows linking together a witness committed to using a univariate polynomial commitment scheme with a witness inside a multilinear polynomial commitment scheme. This yields commit-and-prove (CP) SNARKs with the flexibility of going back and forth between univariate and multilinear encodings of witnesses. This is in contrast to existing CP frameworks that assume compatible polynomial commitment schemes between different components of the proof systems. In addition to application to CP, we also show that our notion yields a version of Spartan with better proof size and verification complexity, at the cost of a more expensive prover.\r\n\r\nWe achieve this via a combination of the following technical contributions: (i) we construct a new univariate commitment scheme in the updatable SRS setting that has better prover complexity than KZG (ii) we construct a new multilinear commitment scheme in the updatable setting that is compatible for linking with our univariate scheme  (iii) we construct an argument of knowledge to prove a given linear relationship between two witnesses committed using a two-tiered commitment scheme (Pedersen+AFG) using Dory as a black-box. These constructions are of independent interest.\r\n\r\nWe implement our commitment schemes and report on performance. We also implement the version of Spartan with our dual polynomial commitment scheme and demonstrate that it outperforms Spartan in proof size and verification complexity.",

    "abstract": "Security against chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCA) concerns privacy of messages even if the adversary has access to the decryption oracle. While the classical notion of CCA security seems to be strong enough to capture many attack scenarios, it falls short of preserving the privacy of messages in the presence of quantum decryption queries, i.e., when an adversary can query a superposition of ciphertexts.\r\n\r\nBoneh and Zhandry (CRYPTO 2013) defined the notion of quantum CCA (qCCA) security to guarantee privacy of messages in the presence of quantum decryption queries. However, their construction is based on an exotic cryptographic primitive (namely, identity-based encryption with security against quantum queries), for which only one instantiation is known. In this work, we comprehensively study qCCA security for public-key encryption (PKE) based on both generic cryptographic primitives and concrete assumptions, yielding the following results:\r\n\r\n* We show that key-dependent message secure encryption (along with PKE) is sufficient to realize qCCA-secure PKE. This yields the first construction of qCCA-secure PKE from the LPN assumption.\r\n\r\n* We prove that hash proof systems imply qCCA-secure PKE, which results in the first instantiation of PKE with qCCA security from (isogeny-based) group actions.\r\n\r\n* We extend the notion of adaptive TDFs (ATDFs) to the quantum setting by introducing quantum ATDFs, and we prove that quantum  ATDFs are sufficient to realize qCCA-secure PKE. We also show how to instantiate quantum ATDFs from the LWE assumption.\r\n\r\n* We show that a single-bit qCCA-secure PKE is sufficient to realize a multi-bit qCCA-secure PKE by extending the completeness of bit encryption for CCA security to the quantum setting.",

    "abstract": "Key blinding produces pseudonymous digital identities by rerandomizing public keys of a digital signature scheme. It is used in anonymous networks to provide the seemingly contradictory goals of anonymity and authentication. Current key blinding schemes are based on the discrete log assumption. Eaton, Stebila and Stracovsky (LATINCRYPT 2021) proposed the first key blinding schemes from lattice assumptions. However, the large public keys and lack of QROM security means they are not ready to replace existing solutions.\r\n\r\nWe present a new way to build key blinding schemes form any MPC-in-the-Head signature scheme. These schemes rely on well-studied symmetric cryptographic primitives and admit short public keys. We prove a general framework for constructing key blinding schemes and for proving their security in the quantum random oracle model (QROM).\r\n\r\nWe instantiate our framework with the recent AES-based Helium signature scheme (Kales and Zaverucha, 2022). Blinding Helium only adds a minor overhead to the signature and verification time. Both Helium and the aforementioned lattice-based key blinding schemes were only proven secure in the ROM. This makes our results the first QROM proof of Helium and the first fully quantum-safe public key blinding scheme.",

Our work builds upon the CRYSTALS family of post-quantum algorithms that have been selected for standardization by NIST. We extend those schemes by imbuing them with the additional functionality of public key expansion: a process by which pseudonymous public keys can be derived by a single public key. Our work is the most detailed analysis yet of BKE: we formally define desired properties of BKE -- unforgeability and unlinkability -- as cryptographic games, and prove that BKE implemented with our modified CRYSTALS schemes satisfy those properties. We implemented our scheme by modifying the Kyber and Dilithium algorithms from the LibOQS project, and we report on our parameter choices and the performance of the schemes.",

    "abstract": "Registered attribute-based encryption (Reg-ABE), introduced by Hohenberger et al. (Eurocrypt\u201923), emerges as a pivotal extension of attribute-based encryption (ABE), aimed at mitigating the key-escrow problem. Although several Reg-ABE schemes with black-box use of cryptography have been proposed so far, there remains a signi\ufb01cant gap in the class of achievable predicates between vanilla ABE and Reg-ABE. To narrow this gap, we propose a modular framework for constructing Reg-ABE schemes for a broader class of predicates. Our framework\r\nis a Reg-ABE analog of the predicate transformation framework for ABE introduced by Attrapadung (Eurocrypt\u201919) and later re\ufb01ned by Attrapadung and Tomida (Asiacrypt\u201920) to function under the standard MDDH assumption. As immediate applications, our framework implies the following new Reg-ABE schemes under the standard MDDH assumption:\r\n\u2013 the \ufb01rst Reg-ABE scheme for (non-)monotone span programs with the traditional completely unbounded property.\r\n\u2013 the \ufb01rst Reg-ABE scheme for general non-monotone span programs (also with the completely unbounded property) as de\ufb01ned in the case of vanilla ABE by Attrapadung and Tomida (Asiacrypt\u201920).\r\nHere, the term \u201ccompletely unbounded\u201d signi\ufb01es the absence of restrictions on attribute sets for users and policies associated with ciphertexts. From a technical standpoint, we \ufb01rst substantially modify pair encoding schemes (PES), originally devised for vanilla ABE by Attrapadung (Eurocrypt\u201914), to make them compatible with\r\nReg-ABE. Subsequently, we present a series of predicate transformations through which we can construct complex predicates, particularly those with an \u201cunbounded\u201d characteristic, starting from simple ones. Finally, we de\ufb01ne new properties of PES necessary for constructing Reg-ABE schemes and prove that these properties are preserved through the transformations. This immediately implies that we can obtain Reg-ABE schemes for any predicates derived via predicate\r\ntransformations.",

Kummer surfaces have been suggested in hyper-elliptic curve cryptography since at least the 1980s and recently these surfaces have reappeared to efficiently compute $(2,2)$-isogenies. We construct several essential analogues of techniques used in one-dimensional isogeny-based cryptography, such as pairings, deterministic point sampling and point compression and give an overview of $(2,2)$-isogenies on Kummer surfaces. We furthermore show how Scholten's construction can be used to transform isogeny-based cryptography over elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ into protocols over Kummer surfaces over $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$\r\n\r\nAs an example of this approach, we demonstrate that SQIsign verification can be performed completely on Kummer surfaces, and, therefore, that one-dimensional SQIsign verification can be viewed as a two-dimensional isogeny between products of elliptic curves. Curiously, the isogeny is then defined over $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ rather than $\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$. Contrary to expectation, the cost of SQIsign verification using Kummer surfaces does not explode: verification costs only 1.5$\\times$ more in terms of finite field operations than the SQIsign variant Apr\u00e8sSQI, optimised for fast verification. Furthermore, it is plausible that arithmetic on Kummer surfaces can be efficiently vectorised, giving Kummer-based protocols over $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ a potential performance boost on modern architectures, possibly surpassing the performance of elliptic-curve analogues over $\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$",

    "abstract": "Secure equality testing and comparison are two important primitives that have been widely used in many secure computation scenarios, such as privacy-preserving machine learning,  private set intersection, secure data mining, etc. In this work, we propose new constant-round two-party computation (2PC) protocols for secure equality testing and secure comparison. Our protocols are designed in the online/offline paradigm. Theoretically, for 32-bit integers, the online communication for our equality testing is only 76 bits, and the cost for our secure comparison is only 384 bits.Our benchmarks show that (i) our equality is $9 \\times$ faster than the Guo \\emph{et al.} (EUROCRYPT 2023) and $15 \\times$ of the garbled circuit scheme (EMP-toolkit). (ii) our secure comparison protocol is $3 \\times$ faster than Guo et al.(EUROCRYPT 2023), $6 \\times$ faster than both Rathee et al. (CCS 2020) and garbled circuit scheme.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic searchable encryption (DSE) with forward and backward privacy reduces leakages in early-stage schemes. Security enhancement comes with a price -- maintaining updatable keyword-wise state information. State information, if stored locally, incurs significant client-side storage overhead for keyword-rich datasets, potentially hindering real-world deployments. \r\n\r\nWe propose DISCO, a simple and efficient framework for designing DSE schemes using constant client state. DISCO combines range-constrained pseudorandom functions (RCPRFs) over a global counter and leverages nice properties from the underlying primitives and index structure to simultaneously achieve forward-and-backward privacy and constant client state. To configure DISCO concretely, we identify a set of RCPRF properties that are vital for the resulting DISCO instantiations. By configuring DISCO with different RCPRFs, we resolve efficiency and usability issues in existing schemes. We further optimize DISCO's concrete efficiency without downgrading security. We implement DISCO constructions and report performance, showing trade-offs from different DISCO constructions. Besides, we compare the practical efficiency of DISCO with existing non-constant-state DSE schemes, demonstrating  DISCO's competitive efficiency.",

    "abstract": "In this note, we study the interplay between the communication from a verifier in a general private-coin interactive protocol and the number of random bits it uses in the protocol. Under worst-case derandomization assumptions, we show that it is possible to transform any $I$-round interactive protocol that uses $\\rho$ random bits into another one for the same problem with the additional property that the verifier's communication is bounded by $O(I\\cdot \\rho)$. Importantly, this is done with a minor, logarithmic, increase in the communication from the prover to the verifier and while preserving the randomness complexity. Along the way, we introduce a new compression game between computationally-bounded compressor and computationally-unbounded decompressor and a new notion of  conditioned efficient distributions that may be of independent interest. Our solutions are based on a combination of perfect hashing and pseudorandom generators.",

    "abstract": "A contingent payment protocol involves two mutually distrustful parties,  a buyer and a seller, operating on the same blockchain, and a digital product, whose ownership is not tracked on a blockchain (e.g. a digital book, but not a NFT). The buyer holds coins on the blockchain and transfers them to the seller in exchange for the product. However, if the blockchain does not hide transaction details, any observer can learn that a buyer purchased some product from a seller. In this work, we take contingent payment a step further: we consider a buyer who wishes to buy a digital product from a seller routing the payment via an untrusted mixer. Crucially, we require that said payment is unlinkable, meaning that the mixer (or any other observer) does not learn which buyer is paying  which seller. We refer to such setting as unlinkable contingent payment (UCP).\r\n    \r\n    We present MixBuy,  a system that realizes UCP. Mixbuy relies on \\emph{oracle-based unlinkable contingent payment} (O-UCP), a novel four-party cryptographic protocol where the mixer pays the seller and the seller provides the buyer with the product only if a semi-trusted notary attests that the buyer has paid the mixer. More specifically, we require four security notions: (i) mixer security that guarantees that if the mixer pays the seller, the intermediary must get paid from the buyer; (ii) seller security that guarantees that if the seller delivers the product to the buyer, the seller must get paid from the intermediary; (iii) buyer security that guarantees that if the buyer pays the intermediary, the buyer must obtain the product; and  (iv) unlinkability that guarantees that given a set of buyers and sellers, the intermediary should not learn which buyer paid which seller.\r\n\r\n    We present a provably secure and efficient cryptographic construction for O-UCP. Our construction can be readily used to realize UCP on most blockchains, as it has minimal functionality requirements (i.e., digital signatures and timelocks). To demonstrate the practicality of our construction, we provide a proof of concept for O-UCP and our benchmarks in commodity hardware show that the communication overhead is small (a few kB per message) and the running time is below one second.",

    "abstract": "We propose a compositional shallow translation from a first-order logic with equality, into polynomials; that is, we arithmetise the semantics of first-order logic.  Using this, we can translate specifications of mathematically structured programming into polynomials, in a form amenable to succinct cryptographic verification.  We give worked example applications, and we propose a proof-of-concept succinct verification scheme based on inner product arguments.\r\n\r\nFirst-order logic is widely used, because it is simple, highly expressive, and has excellent mathematical properties.  Thus a compositional shallow embedding into polynomials suggests a simple, high-level, yet potentially very practical new method for expressing verifiable computation.",

    "abstract": "ElectionGuard is a flexible set of open-source tools that---when used with traditional election systems---can produce end-to-end verifiable elections whose integrity can be verified by observers, candidates, media, and even voters themselves.  ElectionGuard has been integrated into a variety of systems and used in actual public U.S. elections in Wisconsin, California, Idaho, Utah, and Maryland as well as in caucus elections in the U.S. Congress.  It has also been used for civic voting in the Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine and for an online election by a Switzerland/Denmark-based organization.\r\n\r\nThe principal innovation of ElectionGuard is the separation of the cryptographic tools from the core mechanics and user interfaces of voting systems.  This separation allows the cryptography to be designed and built by security experts without having to re-invent and replace the existing infrastructure.  Indeed, in its preferred deployment, ElectionGuard does not replace the existing vote counting infrastructure but instead runs alongside and produces its own independently-verifiable tallies. Although much of the cryptography in ElectionGuard is, by design, not novel, some significant innovations are introduced which greatly simplify the process of verification.\r\n    \r\nThis paper describes the design of ElectionGuard, its innovations, and many of the learnings from its implementation and growing number of real-world deployments.",

    "abstract": "We construct a succinct non-interactive argument (SNARG) system for every NP language $\\mathcal{L}$ that has a propositional proof of non-membership for each $x\\notin \\mathcal{L}$. The soundness of our SNARG system relies on the hardness of the learning with errors (LWE) problem.  The common reference string (CRS) in our construction grows with the space required to verify the propositional proof, and the size of the proof grows poly-logarithmically in the length of the propositional proof.\r\n\r\nUnlike most of the literature on SNARGs, our result implies SNARGs for languages $\\mathcal L$ with proof length shorter than logarithmic in the deterministic time complexity of $\\mathcal L$. Our SNARG improves over prior SNARGs for such ``hard'' NP languages (Sahai and Waters, STOC 2014, Jain and Jin, FOCS 2022) in several ways:\r\n\r\n- For languages with polynomial-length propositional proofs of non-membership, our SNARGs are based on a single, polynomial-time falsifiable assumption, namely LWE. \r\n- Our construction handles propositional proofs of super-polynomial length, as long as they have bounded space, under the subexponential LWE assumption. \r\n- Our SNARGs have a transparent setup, meaning that no private randomness is required to generate the CRS. \r\n\r\nMoreover, our approach departs dramatically from these prior works: we show how to design SNARGs for hard languages without publishing a program (in the CRS) that has the power to verify $\\mathsf{NP}$ witnesses. \r\n\r\nThe key new idea in our cryptographic construction is what we call a ``locally unsatisfiable extension'' of the $\\mathsf{NP}$ verification circuit $\\{C_x\\}_x$. We say that an $\\mathsf{NP}$ verifier has a locally unsatisfiable extension if for every $x\\not\\in \\mathcal L$, there exists an extension $E_x$ of $C_x$ that is not even locally satisfiable in the sense of a local assignment generator [Paneth-Rothblum, TCC 2017]. Crucially, we allow $E_x$ to be depend arbitrarily on $x$ rather than being efficiently constructible.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we show -- via a ``hash-and-BARG'' for a hidden, encrypted computation -- how to build SNARGs for all languages with locally unsatisfiable extensions. We additionally show that propositional proofs of unsatisfiability generically imply the existence of locally unsatisfiable extensions, which allows us to deduce our main results.\r\n\r\nAs an illustrative example, our results imply a SNARG for the decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) language under the LWE assumption.",

    "abstract": "Web3 applications, such as on-chain games, NFT minting, and leader elections necessitate access to unbiased, unpredictable, and publicly verifiable randomness. Despite its broad use cases and huge demand, there is a notable absence of comprehensive treatments of on-chain verifiable randomness services. To bridge this, we offer an extensive formal analysis of on-chain verifiable randomness services. \r\n\r\n    We present the $first$ formalization of on-chain verifiable randomness in the blockchain setting by introducing the notion of Verifiable Randomness as a Service (VRaaS). We formally define VRaaS using an ideal functionality $\\mathcal{F}_{\\sf VRaaS}$ in the Universal Composability model. Our definition not only captures the core features of randomness services, such as unbiasability, unpredictability, and public verifiability, but also accounts for many other crucial nuances pertaining to different entities involved, such as smart contracts. \r\n\r\n    Within our framework we study a generic design of Verifiable Random Function~(VRF)-based randomness service -- where the randomness requester provides an input on which the randomness is evaluated as VRF output. We show that it does satisfy our formal VRaaS definition. Furthermore, we show that the generic protocol captures many real-world randomness services like Chainlink VRF and Supra dVRF.\r\n\r\n    We investigate whether our definition is minimalistic in terms of the desired security properties - towards that, we show that a couple of insecure constructions fall short of realizing our definition. Using our definition we also discover practical vulnerabilities in other designs such as Algorand beacon, Pyth VRF and Band VRF that offer on-chain verifiable randomness.",
