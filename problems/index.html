  <h1><u>The Isogeny Problems</u></h1>

  <blockquote>
    <em>
    What particular goals will there be toward which the leading cryptographical spirits of coming
    generations will strive?
    </em>
  </blockquote>


  <p>
    As lofty minds are led to strive for the advance of science by nothing more than by laying before
    them difficult and at the same time useful problems,
    this page lists the most important open problems in the field of isogeny-based cryptography.
    Gathered by an inquiry among the field, a solution to any of these hard problems 
    signifies a major breakthrough in our field. We hear
    within us the perpetual call: There is the problem. Seek its solution. 
    You can find it by pure reason, for in isogeny-based cryptography, as in mathematics, 
    there is no <i>ignorabimus</i>.

  <h3>Problem 1: The Supersingular Isogeny Problem</h3>

  <h3>Problem 3: Hashing into Supersingular Curves</h3>
  <p>
    Define a cryptographic hash function \( \mathcal{H} \) that takes a binary string \( \mathtt{m} \)
    and returns a supersingular \( j \)-invariant over \(\mathbb{F}_{p^2} \). A correct solution contains the
    description of a hash function that satisfies the following properties:
  <ol>
    <li>It is efficient and deterministic.</li>
    <li>It is hard to find a collision, that is, two binary strings \( \mathtt{m}_1 \) and \( \mathtt{m}_2 \) such that
      \( \mathcal{H}( \mathtt{m}_1 ) = \mathcal{H}( \mathtt{m}_2 ) \).</li>
    <li>It is hard to invert: given an \( h \) in the codomain, it is hard to compute a binary string \( \mathtt{m} \)
      such that \( \mathcal{H}( \mathtt{m} ) = h \).</li>
    <li>The \(j\)-invariants are uniformly distributed in the codomain.</li>
