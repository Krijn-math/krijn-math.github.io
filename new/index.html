            <p>This is my website, which serves to host some of my (professional)
                writings, some thoughts that I have at times and an online version of my
                cv. </p>

            <h2>post-quantum cryptography</h2>
            <p>My research focuses on <b>post-quantum cryptography</b>,
                and at this moment specifically code-based and
                isogeny-based schemes. You could say that I look at <b>isogenies</b> and
                <b>isometries</b>. Both admit a cryptographic group action on which you can
                design all sorts of schemes, although the former is commutative and the
                latter non-commutative.</p>

            <p>
                Within isogenies, my more specific research interests are (applications
                of) <b>pairings</b> and <b>Kummer surfaces</b>. Within isometries, I focus on the
                interplay between automorphism groups and <b>matrix code equivalence</b>.
            </p>

            <h2>the isogeny club</h2>
            <p>For the first two years, I organized <a href="https://isogeny.club" target="_blank">The Isogeny Club</a>,
                together with Jonathan Eriksen.
                Since, May 2024, I have stepped back and taken a more advisory role.
                Currently, Jonathan and Maria Corte-Real Santos host the bi-weekly
                virtual seminar for young isogenists. The Isogeny Club also hosts the
                Brainstorm Days as an affiliated event (for all isogenists) at
                Eurocrypt, where we brainstorm on cutting-edge ideas in isogeny-based
                cryptography.</p>
