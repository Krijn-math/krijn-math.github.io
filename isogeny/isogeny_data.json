        "abstract": "The Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) scheme is a public key cryptosystem that was submitted to the National Institute of Standards and Technology's competition for the standardization of post-quantum cryptography protocols. The private key in SIDH consists of an isogeny whose degree is a prime power. In July 2022, Castryck and Decru discovered an attack that completely breaks the scheme by recovering Bob's secret key, using isogenies between higher dimensional abelian varieties to interpolate and reconstruct the isogenies comprising the SIDH private key. The original attack applies in theory to any prime power degree, but the implementation accompanying the original attack required one of the SIDH keys involved in a key exchange to have degree equal to a power of 2. An implementation of the power of 3 case was published subsequently by Decru and Kunzweiler. However, despite the passage of several years, nobody has published any implementations for prime powers other than 2 or 3, and for good reason --- the necessary higher dimensional isogeny computations rapidly become more complicated as the base prime increases. In this paper, we provide for the first time a fully general isogeny interpolation implementation that works for any choice of base prime, and provide timing benchmarks for various combinations of SIDH base prime pairs. We remark that the technique of isogeny interpolation now has constructive applications as well as destructive applications, and that our methods may open the door to increased flexibility in constructing isogeny-based digital signatures and cryptosystems.",

Recently, Cong, Lai and Levin (ACNS'23) have investigated the use of general-purpose (non-interactive) zero-knowledge proof systems for proving the knowledge of an isogeny of degree 2\u1d4f between supersingular elliptic curves. In particular, their approach is to model this relation via a sequence of k successive steps of a walk in the supersingular isogeny graph and to show that the respective j-invariants are roots of the second modular polynomial. They then arithmetize this relation and show that this approach, when compared to state-of-the-art tailor-made proofs of knowledge by Basso et al. (EUROCRYPT'23), gives a 3-10\u00d7 improvement in proof and verification times, with comparable proof sizes. \r\n\r\n In this paper we ask whether we can further improve the modular polynomial-based approach and generalize its application to primes {\u2113>2}, as used in some recent isogeny-based constructions. We will answer these questions affirmatively, by designing efficient arithmetizations for each {\u2113 \u2208 {2, 3, 5, 7, 13}} that achieve an improvement over Cong, Lai and Levin of up to 48%.\r\n\r\n Our main technical tool and source of efficiency gains is to switch from classical modular polynomials to canonical modular polynomials. Adapting the well-known results on the former to the latter polynomials, however, is not straight-forward and requires some technical effort. We prove various interesting connections via novel use of resultant theory, and advance the understanding of canonical modular polynomials, which might be of independent interest.",

The attack was executed on a cluster and required less than 10 core-years and 256TiB of high-performance network storage (GPFS). Different trade-offs allow execution of the attack with similar time complexity and reduced storage requirements of only about 70TiB.",

Recently, many isogeny-based cryptosystems  using  isogenies between Kummer surfaces were proposed. Most of those cryptosystems use (2,2)-isogenies. However, to enhance the possibility of cryptosystems, higher degree isogenies, say (\u2113,\u2113)-isogenies for an odd \u2113, is also crucial. For an odd \u2113, the Lubicz-Robert gave a  formula to compute (\u2113)\u1d4d-isogenies in general dimension g.  In this paper, we propose explicit and efficient algorithms to compute (\u2113,\u2113)-isogenies  between Kummer surfaces, based on the Lubicz-Robert formula.In particular, we propose two algorithms for computing the codomain of the isogeny and two algorithms for evaluating the image of a point under the isogeny. Then, we count the number of arithmetic operations required for each of our proposed algorithms, and determine the most efficient algorithm in terms of the number of arithmetic operations from each of two types of algorithms for each \u2113.

        "abstract": "We extend the usual ideal action on oriented elliptic curves to a (Hermitian) module action on oriented (polarised) abelian varieties. Oriented abelian varieties are naturally enriched in R-modules, and our module action comes from the canonical power object construction on categories enriched in a closed symmetric monoidal category. In particular our action is canonical and gives a fully fledged symmetric monoidal action. Furthermore, we give algorithms to compute this action in practice, generalising the usual algorithms in rank~1.\r\n\r\nThe action allows us to unify in the same framework, on the one hand isogeny based cryptography based on ordinary or oriented elliptic curves, and on the other hand the one based on supersingular elliptic curves defined over \ud835\udd3d_{p\u00b2}. In particular, from our point of view, supersingular elliptic curves over \ud835\udd3d\u209a are given by a rank~1 module action, while (the Weil restriction) of those defined over \ud835\udd3d_{p\u00b2} are given by a rank~2 module action. As a consequence, rank~2 module action inversion is at least as hard as the supersingular isogeny path problem.\r\n\r\nWe thus propose to use Hermitian modules as an avatar of a cryptographic symmetric monoidal action framework. This generalizes the more standard cryptographic group action framework, and still allows for a NIKE (Non Interactive Key Exchange). The main advantage of our action is that, presumably, Kuperberg's algorithm does not apply. Compared to CSIDH, this allows for more compact keys and much better scaling properties. \r\n\r\nIn practice, we propose the key exchange scheme \u2297-MIKE (Tensor Module Isogeny Key Exchange). Alice and Bob start from a supersingular elliptic curve E\u2080/\ud835\udd3d\u209a and both compute a 2\u207f-isogeny over \ud835\udd3d_{p\u00b2}. They each send the j-invariant of their curve. Crucially, unlike SIDH, no torsion information at all is required. Their common secret, given by the module action, is then a dimension~4 principally polarised abelian variety. We obtain a very compact post-quantum NIKE: only 64B for NIST level~1 security.",

The main advantage of this new scheme is its compactness, with combined public key and proof size of roughly 450 bytes, which is orders of magnitude smaller than other generic purpose post-quantum VRF constructions. This scheme is also the first post-quantum VRF satisfying unconditional uniqueness. We show that this scheme is practical by providing a first non-optimized C implementation that runs in roughly 20ms for verification and 175ms for evaluation. \r\n\r\n    The function at the heart of our construction is the one that computes the codomain of an isogeny of big prime degree from its kernel. The evaluation can be performed efficiently with the knowledge of the endomorphism ring using a new ideal-to-isogeny algorithm introduced recently by Basso, Dartois, De Feo, Leroux, Maino, Pope, Robert and Wesolowski that uses computation of dimension 2 isogenies between elliptic products to compute effectively the translation through the Deuring correspondence of any ideal. On the other hand, without the knowledge of the endomorphism ring, this computation appears to be hard. The security of our \\mathsf{DeuringVUF} holds under a new assumption call the one-more isogeny problem (OMIP). \r\n\r\n    Another application of \\mathsf{DeuringVUF} is the first hash-and-sign signature based on isogenies in the standard model. While we don't expect the signature in itself to outperform the recent variants of SQIsign, it remains very competitive in both compactness and efficiency while providing a new framework to build isogeny-based signature that could lead to new interesting applications.  \r\n\r\n    We also introduce several new algorithms for the effective Deuring correspondence. In particular, we introduce an algorithm to translate an ideal of norm a big power of a small prime \u2113 into the corresponding isogeny of dimension 1 using isogenies between abelian variety of dimension 2 as a tool.\r\n    This algorithm can be used to improve the SQIsign signature scheme.",

Intriguingly, this includes  the challenge isogeny which is also a non-smooth degree isogeny, but has an accessible kernel.

The second variant, SQIPrime2D,  solely uses dimension 2 isogenies. This is achieved by setting the degree of the secret isogeny to be equal to that of the challenge isogeny and  further exploiting Kani's Lemma.

In particular, SQIsign2D's efficient signing and verification times have made it a focal point of recent research. However, the absence of an optimized one-dimensional verification implementation hampers a thorough comparison between these different variants.\r\n\r\nThis work bridges this gap in the literature: we provide a state-of-the-art implementation of one-dimensional SQIsign verification, including novel optimizations. We report a record-breaking one-dimensional SQIsign verification time of 8.55 Mcycles on a Raptor Lake Intel processor, closely matching SQIsign2D on the same processor. For uncompressed signatures, the signature size doubles and we verify in only 5.6 Mcycles. Taking advantage of the inherent parallelism available in isogeny computations, we present 5-core variants that can go as low as 1.3 Mcycles. Furthermore, we present the first implementation that supports both 32-bit and 64-bit processors. It includes optimized assembly code for the Cortex-M4 and has been integrated with the pqm4 project.

On a Montgomery curve with full rational 2-torsion, our half ladder first build a succession of isogeny images P\u1d62=\u03d5\u1d62(P\u1d62\u208b\u2081), which only depends on the base point P and not the scalar n, for a pre-computation cost of 2S+1m\u2080 by bit. Then we use half doublings and half differential additions to compute any scalar multiplication n \u22c5 P, for a cost of 4M+2S+1m\u2080 by bit. The total cost is then 4M+4S+2m\u2080, even when the base point P is not normalized. By contrast, the usual Montgomery ladder costs 4M+4S+1m+1m\u2080 by bit, for a normalized point.\r\n\r\nIn the appendix, we extend our approach to higher dimensional ladders in theta coordinates or twisted theta coordinates. In dimension~2, after a precomputation step which depends on the base point~P, our half ladder only costs 7M + 4S+3m\u2080, compared to 10M+9S+6m\u2080 for the standard ladder.",

SQIsign has attracted much attention because of its very short signature and key size among the candidates for the NIST PQC standardization.

Under this correspondence, an isogeny between elliptic curves corresponds to a quaternion ideal. This correspondence plays an important role in isogeny-based cryptography and several algorithms to compute an isogeny corresponding to a quaternion ideal (ideal-to-isogeny algorithms) have been proposed. In particular, SQIsign is a signature scheme based on the Deuring correspondence and uses an ideal-to-isogeny algorithm. In this paper, we propose a novel ideal-to-isogeny algorithm using isogenies of dimension 2. Our algorithm is based on Kani's reducibility theorem, which gives a connection between isogenies of dimension 1 and 2. By using the characteristic p of the base field of the form 2\u1da0g \u2212 1 for a small odd integer g, our algorithm works by only 2-isogenies and (2, 2)-isogenies in the operations in \ud835\udd3d_{p\u00b2}. We apply our algorithm to SQIsign and compare the efficiency of the new algorithm with the existing one. Our analysis shows that the key generation and the signing in our algorithm are at least twice as fast as those in the existing algorithm at the NIST security level 1. This advantage becomes more significant at higher security levels. In addition, our algorithm also improves the efficiency of the verification in SQIsign.",

SQIsignHD overcomes the main drawbacks of SQIsign. First, it scales well to high security levels, since the public parameters for SQIsignHD are easy to generate: the characteristic of the underlying field needs only be of the form 2\u1da03^{f'}\u22121. Second, the signing procedure is simpler and more efficient. Our signing procedure implemented in C runs in 28 ms, which is a significant improvement compared to SQISign. Third, the scheme is easier to analyse, allowing for a much more compelling security reduction. Finally, the signature sizes are even more compact than (the already record-breaking) SQIsign, with compressed signatures as small as 109 bytes for the post-quantum NIST-1 level of security.\r\nThese advantages may come at the expense of the verification, which now requires the computation of an isogeny in dimension 4, a task whose optimised cost is still uncertain, as it has been the focus of very little attention. Our experimental sagemath implementation of the verification runs in around 600 ms, indicating the potential cryptographic interest of dimension 4 isogenies after optimisations and low level implementation.",

Currently, SQIsign and its variants are the most promising isogeny-based digital signature schemes.\r\nIn this paper, we propose a new structure for the SQIsign family: Pentagon Isogeny-based Signature in High Dimension (referred to as \u03a0-signHD). \r\n The new structure separates the hash of the commitment and that of the message by employing two  cryptographic  hash functions. This feature is desirable in reality, particularly for applications based on mobile low-power devices or for those deployed interactively over the Internet or in the cloud computing setting. This structure can be generally applicable to all the variants of SQIsign. In this work, we focus on the instance based on SQIsignHD, proposed by Dartois, Leroux, Robert and Wesolowski (Eurocrypt 2024).

For the NIST-I security level, the signature size of \u03a0-signHD can be reduced to 519 bits, while the SQIsignHD signature takes 870 bits.

The framework enables two parties to manipulate higher-dimensional representations of isogenies to efficiently compute their pushforwards, and ultimately to obtain a shared secret.\r\n\r\nWe provide three constructions based on POKE: the first is a PKE protocol, which is one of the most compact post-quantum PKEs and possibly the most efficient isogeny-based PKE to date. We then introduce a validation technique to ensure the correctness of uniSIDH public keys: by combining the validation method with a POKE-based construction, we obtain a split KEM, a primitive that generalizes NIKEs and can be used to instantiate a post-quantum version of the Signal's X3DH protocol. The third construction builds upon the split KEM and its validation method to obtain a round-optimal verifiable OPRF. It is the first such construction that does not require more than \u03bb isogeny computations, and it is significantly more compact and more efficient than all other isogeny-based OPRFs.",

        "abstract": "This work expands the machinery we have for isogeny-based cryptography in genus 2 by developing a toolbox of several essential algorithms for Kummer surfaces, the dimension-2 analogue of x-only arithmetic on elliptic curves. Kummer surfaces have been suggested in hyper-elliptic curve cryptography since at least the 1980s and recently these surfaces have reappeared to efficiently compute (2,2)-isogenies. We construct several essential analogues of techniques used in one-dimensional isogeny-based cryptography, such as pairings, deterministic point sampling and point compression and give an overview of (2,2)-isogenies on Kummer surfaces. We furthermore show how Scholten's construction can be used to transform isogeny-based cryptography over elliptic curves over \ud835\udd3d_{p\u00b2} into protocols over Kummer surfaces over \ud835\udd3d\u209a\r\n\r\nAs an example of this approach, we demonstrate that SQIsign verification can be performed completely on Kummer surfaces, and, therefore, that one-dimensional SQIsign verification can be viewed as a two-dimensional isogeny between products of elliptic curves. Curiously, the isogeny is then defined over \ud835\udd3d\u209a rather than \ud835\udd3d_{p\u00b2}. Contrary to expectation, the cost of SQIsign verification using Kummer surfaces does not explode: verification costs only 1.5\u00d7 more in terms of finite field operations than the SQIsign variant Apr\u00e8sSQI, optimised for fast verification. Furthermore, it is plausible that arithmetic on Kummer surfaces can be efficiently vectorised, giving Kummer-based protocols over \ud835\udd3d\u209a a potential performance boost on modern architectures, possibly surpassing the performance of elliptic-curve analogues over \ud835\udd3d_{p\u00b2}",

Such operations heavily depend on the sizes of prime fields. At the 192-bit security level, Gasnier and Guillevic presented a curve named GG22D7-457 with CM-discriminant D = 7 and embedding degree k = 22. Compared to other well-known pairing-friendly curves at the same security level, the curve GG22D7-457 has smaller  prime field size and \u03c1-value, which benefits from  the fast operations on  \ud835\udd3e\u2081. However, the pairing computation on GG22D7-457 is not efficient. \r\n        In this paper, we investigate to derive a higher performance for the pairing computation on GG22D7-457. We first propose novel formulas of the super-optimal pairing on this curve by utilizing a 2-isogeny as GLV-endomorphism. Besides, this tool can be generalized to more generic families of pairing-friendly curves with n-isogenies as endomorphisms. In our paper, we provide the explicit formulas for the super-optimal pairings exploiting 2, 3-isogenies. Finally, we make a concrete computational cost analysis and  implement the pairing computations on curve GG22D7-457  using our approaches. In terms of Miller function evaluation, employing the techniques in this paper obtain a  saving of  24.44%   in  \ud835\udd3d\u209a-multiplications  compared to the  optimal ate pairing.  As for the running time, the experimental results illustrate that the Miller loop on GG22D7-457 by utilizing our methods is 26.0% faster than the state-of-the-art. Additionally, the performance of the super-optimal pairing on GG22D7-457 is competitive compared to  the well-known pairing-friendly curves at the 192-bit security level. These results show that GG22D7-457  becomes an attractive candidate for the pairing-based protocols.

Quantum cryptographic and post-quantum cryptography are being extensively researched for securing future information. The quantum computer and quantum algorithms are still in the early developmental stage and thus lack scalability for practical application. As a result of these challenges, most researched PQC  methods are lattice-based, code-based, ECC isogeny, hash-based, and multivariate crypto schemes. In this paper, we explore other athematical topics such as stereographic projection, Mobius transformation, change of basis, Apollonian circle, Binary Quadratic form equivalence, Gauss composition law, and its conjunctions. It fulfills preliminary conditions like bijection, primality, and np-hard problems, and the feasibility of one-way functions along with its interconnection. Thus allowing the exploration of new realms of mathematics for the development of secure protocols for future communication.",

We start by developing a basic and easy-to-implement divstep version of the algorithm defined in terms of full-precision division steps. We then describe an optimized version due to Hamburg over word-sized inputs, similar to the jumpdivstep version of the BY algorithm, and formally verify its correctness. Along the way, we introduce a number of optimizations for implementing both versions in constant time and at high-speed. The resulting algorithms are particularly suitable for the special case of computing the Legendre symbol with dense prime p, where no efficient addition chain is known for the conventional approach by exponentiation to \\frac{p\u22121}{2}. This is often the case for the base field of popular pairing-friendly elliptic curves. Our high-speed implementation for a range of parameters shows that the new algorithm is up to 40 times faster than the conventional exponentiation approach, and up to 25.7\\% faster than the previous state of the art. We illustrate the performance of the algorithm with an application for hashing to elliptic curves, where the observed savings amount to 14.7\\% -- 48.1\\% when used for testing quadratic residuosity within the SwiftEC hashing algorithm. We also apply our techniques to the CTIDH isogeny-based key exchange, with savings of 3.5--13.5\\%.",

Those twins whose sum is a prime are of interest in the parameter setup of certain isogeny-based cryptosystems such as SQIsign. The approach to find such twins is to find two polynomials in \u211a[x] that split into a product of small degree factors and differ by 1. Then evaluate them on a particular smooth integer. This was first explored by Costello, Meyer and Naehrig at EUROCRYPT'21 using polynomials that split completely into linear factors which were found using Diophantine number theory. The polynomials used in this work split into mostly linear factors with the exception of a few quadratic factors. Some of these linear factors are repeated and so the overall smoothness probability is either better or comparable to that of the prior polynomials. We use these polynomials to search for large smooth twins whose sum is prime. In particular, the smoothness bounds of the 384 and 512-bit twins that we find are significantly smaller than those found in EUROCRYPT'21.",

To optimize the partition, we adjust it to enhance the utilization of x-coordinates and eliminate the computational redundancy, which can ultimately reduce the number of  \ud835\udd3d\u209a-multiplications. The speedup of the sums of products is to employ two techniques: lazy reduction (abbreviated as LZYR) and generalized interleaved Montgomery multiplication (abbreviated as INTL). These techniques aim to minimize the underlying operations such as \ud835\udd3d\u209a-reductions and assembly memory instructions. We  present an optimized C and assembly code implementation of \u221a\\'{e}lu for the  CTIDH512 instantiation. In terms of \u2113-isogeny computations in CTIDH512,  the performance of clock cycles  applying new partition + INTL (resp. new partition + LZYR) offers an improvement up to 16.05% (resp.  10.96%) compared to the previous work.",

By injecting a fault into the ideal generator during the commitment phase, we demonstrate a meaningful probability of inducing the generation of order \ud835\udcaa\u2080. The probability is bounded by one parameter, the degree of commitment isogeny. We also show that the probability can be reasonably estimated by assuming uniform randomness of a random variable, and provide empirical evidence supporting the validity of this approximation. In addition, we identify a loop-abort vulnerability due to the iterative structure of the isogeny operation. Exploiting these vulnerabilities, we present key recovery fault attack scenarios for two versions of SQIsign---one deterministic and the other randomized. We then analyze the time complexity and the number of queries required for each attack. Finally, we discuss straightforward countermeasures that can be implemented against the attack.",

However, in most isogeny-based protocols, the performance of pairing computations is unsatisfactory due to the high computational cost of the Miller function. Reducing the computational expense of the Miller function is crucial for enhancing the overall performance of pairing computations in isogeny-based cryptography.\r\n\r\nThis paper addresses this efficiency bottleneck. To achieve this, we propose several techniques for a better implementation of pairings in isogeny-based cryptosystems. We use (modified) Jacobian coordinates and present new algorithms for Miller function computations to compute pairings of order 2^\u2022 and 3^\u2022. For pairings of arbitrary order, which are crucial for key compression in some SIDH-based schemes (such as M-SIDH and binSIDH), we combine Miller doublings with Miller additions/subtractions, leading to a considerable speedup. Moreover, the optimizations for pairing applications in CSIDH-based protocols are also considered in this paper. In particular, our approach for supersingularity verification in CSIDH is 15.3% faster than Doliskani's test, which is the state-of-the-art.",

For this scheme to be binding, one relies on a  trusted party to generate a starting supersingular elliptic curve of unknown endomorphism ring.  In fact, the knowledge of the endomorphism ring allows one to compute an endomorphism of degree a power of a given small prime. Such an endomorphism can then be split into two to obtain two different messages with the same commitment. This is the reason why one needs a curve of unknown endomorphism ring, and the only known way to generate such supersingular curves is to rely on a trusted party or on some expensive multiparty computation.  We observe that if the degree of the endomorphism in play is well chosen, then the knowledge of the endomorphism ring is not sufficient to efficiently compute such an endomorphism and in some particular cases, one can even prove that endomorphism of a certain degree do not exist. Leveraging these observations, we adapt Sterner's commitment scheme in such a way that the endomorphism ring of the starting curve can be known and public. This allows us to obtain isogeny-based commitment schemes which can be instantiated without  trusted setup requirements.",

While lattices offer the necessary homomorphic properties, the introduced noise allows only a bounded number of updates. Group actions have become an important alternative, however, their structure is limited. The only known UE scheme by Leroux and Rom\u00e9as (IACR ePrint 2022/739) uses effective triple orbital group actions which uses additional algebraic structure of CSIDH. Using an ideal cipher, similar to the group-based scheme \\mathsf{SHINE} (Boyd et al., CRYPTO 2020), requires the group action to be mappable, a property that natural isogeny-based group actions do not satisfy.

        "abstract": "Isogeny-based cryptography is one of the candidates for post-quantum cryptography. One of the benefits of using isogeny-based cryptography is its compactness. In particular, a key exchange scheme SIDH allowed us to use a 4\u03bb-bit prime for the security parameter \u03bb.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, SIDH was broken in 2022 by some studies. After that, some isogeny-based key exchange and public key encryption schemes have been proposed; however, most of these schemes use primes whose sizes are not guaranteed as linearly related to the security parameter \u03bb. As far as we know, the remaining schemes have not been implemented due to the computation of isogenies of high dimensional abelian varieties, or they need to use a ``weak\" curve (\\textit{i.e.}, a curve whose endomorphism ring is known) as the starting curve.\r\n\r\nIn this study, we propose a novel compact isogeny-based key encapsulation mechanism named IS-CUBE via Kani's theorem and a 3-dimensional SIDH diagram. A prime used in IS-CUBE is of the size of about 8\u03bb bits, and we can use a random supersingular elliptic curve for the starting curve. The public key of IS-CUBE is about 3 times larger than that of SIKE, and the ciphertext of IS-CUBE is about 4 times larger than that of SIKE from theoretical estimation. In practice, compared to FESTA, the public key of IS-CUBE is slightly larger and its ciphertext is slightly smaller.\r\n\r\nThe core idea of IS-CUBE comes from the hardness of some already known computational problems and a novel computational problem (the Long Isogeny with Torsion (LIT) problem), which is the problem to compute a hidden isogeny from two given supersingular elliptic curves and information of torsion points of relatively small order.",

        "abstract": "Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions (OPRFs) are an elementary building block in cryptographic and privacy-preserving applications. However, while there are numerous pre-quantum secure OPRF constructions, few options exist in a post-quantum secure setting, and of those even fewer are practical for modern-day applications. In this work, we focus on isogeny group actions, as the associated low bandwidth leads to efficient constructions. Our results focus on the Naor-Reingold OPRF. We introduce OPUS, a novel OPRF from isogenies without oblivious transfer, and show efficient evaluations of the Naor-Reingold PRF using CSIDH and CSI-FiSh. Additionally, we analyze a previous proposal of a CSIDH-based OPRF and that the straightforward instantiation of the protocol leaks the server\u2019s private key. As a result, we propose mitigations to address those shortcomings, which require additional hardness assumptions. Our results report a very competitive protocol when combined with lattices for Oblivious Transfer.\r\nOur comparison against the state of the art shows that OPUS and the repaired, generic construction are competitive with other proposals in terms of speed and communication size. More concretely, OPUS achieves almost two orders of magnitude less communication overhead compared to the next-best lattice-based OPRF at the cost of higher latency and higher computational cost, and the repaired construction. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of OPUS and the generic NR-OT in two use cases: first, we instantiate OPAQUE, a protocol for asymmetric authenticated key exchange. Compared to classical elliptic curve cryptography, this results in less than 100 \u00d7 longer computation on average and around 1000\u00d7 more communication overhead. Second, we perform an unbalanced private set intersection and show that the communication overhead can be roughly the same when using isogenies or elliptic curves, at the cost of much higher runtime. Conversely, for sets of the size 210 , we report a runtime around 200\u00d7 slower than the elliptic curve PSI. This concretizes the overhead of performing PSI and using OPAQUE with isogenies for the first time",

We propose two algorithms for the secure and verifiable delegation of isogeny computations in the CSIDH setting. We then apply these algorithms to different instances of CSIDH and to the signing algorithms SeaSign and CSI-FiSh. Our algorithms present a communication-cost trade-off. Asymptotically (for high communication), the cost for the delegator is reduced by a factor 9 for the original CSIDH-512 parameter set and a factor 30 for SQALE'd CSIDH-4096, while the relative cost of SeaSign vanishes. Even for much lower communication cost, we come close to these asymptotic results. Using the knowledge of the class group, the delegation of CSI-FiSh is basically free (up to element generation) already at a very low communication cost.",

Speeding up the expensive post-quantum cryptographic operations by delegating these computations from a weaker client to untrusted powerful external servers is a promising approach. Following this, we present in this work mechanisms allowing computationally restricted devices to securely and verifiably delegate isogeny computations to potentially untrusted third parties. In particular, we propose two algorithms that can be seamlessly integrated into existing isogeny-based protocols and which lead to a much lower cost for the delegator than the full, local computation.

While this was true a decade ago, the recent advances in the study of supersingular curves through the Deuring correspondence motivated by isogeny-based cryptography has provided all the tools to perform the necessary tasks efficiently.\r\n    \r\n    Our main ingredients are two new heuristic algorithms to compute the j-invariants of supersingular curves having an endomorphism ring contained in some set of isomorphism class of maximal orders. The first one is derived easily from the existing tools of isogeny-based cryptography, while the second introduces new ideas to perform that task efficiently for a big number of maximal orders at the same time.  \r\n\r\n    For each of the polynomials (Hilbert and modular), we obtain two algorithms. The first one, that we will qualify as \\textit{direct}, is based on the computation of a set of well-chosen supersingular j-invariants defined over \\FF_{p\u00b2} and uses the aforementioned algorithm to translate maximal orders to j-invariants as its main building block.\r\n    The second one is a CRT algorithm that applies the direct algorithm on a set of small primes and reconstruct the result modulo p with the chinese remainder theorem. \r\n    \r\n    In both cases, the direct algorithm achieves the best known complexity for primes p that are relatively small compared to the discriminant (for the Hilbert case) and to the level (for the modular case). \r\n    \r\n    Our CRT algorithms matches the complexities of the state-of-the-art CRT approach based on ordinary curves, while improving some of the steps, thus opening the possibility to a better practical efficiency.   \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Second, we revisit the CRT method for both class and modular polynomials. We show that applying our second heuristic algorithm over supersingular curves to the CRT approach yields the same asymptotic complexity as the best known algorithms based on ordinary curves and we argue that our new approach might be more efficient in practice. \r\n    The situation appears especially promising for modular polynomials, as our approach reduces the asymptotic cost of elliptic curve operations by a linear factor in the level \u2113.

We provide the first thorough assessment of the practicality of CSIDH in higher parameter sizes for conservative estimates of quantum security, and with protection against physical attacks.\r\n\r\nThis requires a three-fold analysis of CSIDH. First, we describe two approaches to efficient high-security CSIDH implementations, based on SQALE and CTIDH. Second, we optimize such high-security implementations, on a high level by improving several subroutines, and on a low level by improving the finite field arithmetic. Third, we benchmark the performance of high-security CSIDH. As a stand-alone primitive, our implementations outperform previous results by a factor up to 2.53\u00d7.\r\n\r\nAs a real-world use case considering network protocols, we use CSIDH in TLS variants that allow early authentication through a NIKE. Although our instantiations of CSIDH have smaller communication requirements than post-quantum KEM and signature schemes, even our highly-optimized implementations result in too-large handshake latency (tens of seconds), showing that CSIDH is only practical in niche cases.",

Similarly to CSIDH and OSIDH, we use the group action of an imaginary quadratic order\u2019s class group on the set of oriented supersingular curves. Compared to CSIDH, the main benefit of our construction is that it is easy to compute the class-group structure; this data is required to uniquely represent\u2009\u2014\u2009and efficiently act by\u2009\u2014\u2009arbitrary group elements, which is a requirement in, e.g., the CSI-FiSh signature scheme by Beullens, Kleinjung and Vercauteren. The index-calculus algorithm used in CSI-FiSh to compute the class-group structure has complexity L(1/2), ruling out class groups much larger than CSIDH-512, a limitation that is particularly problematic in light of the ongoing debate regarding the quantum security of cryptographic group actions.\r\n\r\nHoping to solve this issue, we consider the class group of a quadratic order of large prime conductor inside an imaginary quadratic field of small discriminant. This family of quadratic orders lets us easily determine the size of the class group, and, by carefully choosing the conductor, even exercise significant control on it\u2009\u2014\u2009in particular supporting highly smooth choices. Although evaluating the resulting group action still has subexponential asymptotic complexity, a careful choice of parameters leads to a practical speedup that we demonstrate in practice for a security level equivalent to CSIDH-1024, a parameter currently firmly out of reach of index-calculus-based methods. However, our implementation takes 35 seconds (resp. 12.5 minutes) for a single group-action evaluation at a CSIDH-512-equivalent (resp. CSIDH-1024-equivalent) security level, showing that, while feasible, the SCALLOP group action does not achieve realistically usable performance yet.",

In our approach the input is a path in the 2-isogeny graph and the output is the maximal order isomorphic to the endomorphism ring of the curve at the end of that path.

It was only recently shown in a seminal work by Benhamouda et al. (EUROCRYPT'21) that this is not just a limitation of the proof technique. They proposed an elegant polynomial time attack against the \u2113-concurrently unforgeability of the classical blind Schnorr protocol for \u2113 = \\mathsf{poly}(\u03bb). \r\nHowever, there are still many blind signatures following a similar recipe to blind Schnorr where the attack by Benhamouda et al. does not apply.  This includes for instance the isogeny-based blind signature CSI-Otter by Katsumata et al (CRYPTO'23), the lattice-based blind signatures Blaze+ by Alkeilani et al. (ACISP'20) and BlindOR by Alkeilani et al. (CANS'20). \r\n\r\nIn this work, we provide a simple and novel attack on blind signatures based on identification protocols performing parallel repetition to reduce the soundness error.  Our attack translates to a polynomial time break for the \u2113-concurrent unforgeability of CSI-Otter, Blaze+, and BlindOR for \u2113 = \\mathsf{poly}(\u03bb).  \r\nMore formally, we define an intermediate problem called Parallel Random inhomogeneities in an Overdetermined Solvable system of linear equations (pROS) problem and show that an attack against pROS implies an attack to the above blind signatures. \r\nOne takeaway of our finding is that while parallel repetition allows to exponentially reduce the soundness error of an identification protocol, this has minimal effect on the resulting blind signature. Our attack is concretely very efficient and for instance breaks 4-concurrent unforgeability of CSI-Otter in time roughly 2\u00b3\u2074 hash computations.",

Moreover, a malicious user cannot output \u2113+1 signatures while only finishing \u2113 signing sessions. This notion, called \\mathit{one}-\\mathit{more} unforgeability, comes in two flavors supporting either \\mathit{sequential} or \\mathit{concurrent} sessions.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we investigate the security of a class of blind signatures constructed from Sigma-protocols with small challenge space \ud835\udc9e_{\u03a3} (i.e.,  polynomial in the security parameter), using k repetitions of the protocol to decrease the chances of a cheating prover. This class of schemes includes, among others, the Schnorr blind signature scheme with bit challenges and the recently proposed isogeny-based scheme CSI-Otter (Crypto'23),  as well as potential blind signatures designed from assumptions with the well-known Sigma-protocol for the graph-isomorphism problem (e.g., Lattice Isomorphism Problem).\r\n\r\nFor this class of blind signatures, we show a \\mathit{polynomial}-\\mathit{time} attack that breaks one-more unforgeability for any \u2113 \u2265 k concurrent sessions in time O(k \u22c5 |\ud835\udc9e_{\u03a3}|). Contrary to the ROS attack, ours is generic and does not require any particular algebraic structure. We also propose a computational trade-off, where, for any t \u2264 k, our attack works for \u2113 = \\frac{k}{t} in time O(\\frac{k}{t} \u22c5 |\ud835\udc9e_{\u03a3}|\u1d57). \r\n\r\nThe consequences of our attack are as follows. Schemes in the investigated class of blind signatures should not be used concurrently without applying specific transformations to boost the security to support more signing sessions. Moreover, for the parameters proposed for CSI-Otter (k=128 and |\ud835\udc9e_{\u03a3}|=2), the scheme becomes forgeable after 128 concurrent signing sessions for the basic attack and with only eight sessions in our optimized attack. We also show that for those parameters, it is even possible to compute two signatures in around 10 minutes with just one signing session using the computation power of the Bitcoin network. Thus, we show that, for sequential security, the parameter k must be at least doubled in the security parameter for any of the investigated schemes.",

        "abstract": "Non-Interactive Verifiable Secret Sharing (NI-VSS) is a technique for distributing a secret among a group of individuals in a verifiable manner, such that shareholders can verify the validity of their received share and only a specific number of them can access the secret. VSS is a fundamental tool in cryptography and distributed computing. In this paper, we present an extremely efficient NI-VSS scheme using Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs on secret shared data. While prior VSS schemes have implicitly used ZK proofs on secret shared data, we specifically use their formal definition recently provided by Boneh et al. in CRYPTO 2019. The proposed NI-VSS scheme uses a quantum random oracle and a quantum computationally hiding commitment scheme in a black-box manner, which ensures its ease of use, especially in post-quantum threshold protocols. Implementation results further solidify its practicality and superiority over current constructions. With the new VSS scheme, for parameter sets (n, t)=(128, 63) and (2048, 1023), a dealer can share a secret in less than 0.02 and 2.0 seconds, respectively, and shareholders can verify their shares in less than 0.4 and 5.0 milliseconds. Compared to the well-established Pedersen VSS scheme, for the same parameter sets, at the cost of slightly higher communication, the new scheme is respectively 22.5\u00d7 and 3.25\u00d7 faster in the sharing phase, and notably needs 271\u00d7 and 479\u00d7 less time in the verification. Leveraging the new NI-VSS scheme, we revisit several classic and PQ-secure threshold protocols and improve their efficiency. Our revisions led to more efficient versions of both the Pedersen DKG protocol and the GJKR threshold signature scheme. We show similar efficiency enhancements and improved resilience to malicious parties in isogeny-based DKG and threshold signature schemes. We think, due to its remarkable efficiency and ease of use, the new NI-VSS scheme can be a valuable tool for a wide range of threshold protocols.",

To thwart this attack, two recent proposals, M-SIDH and FESTA, proceed by only revealing the images upto unknown scalars \u03bb\u2081, \u03bb\u2082 \u2208 \u2124_N^\u00d7, i.e., only \u03bb\u2081 \u03c6(P) and \u03bb\u2082 \u03c6(Q) are revealed, where \u03bb\u2081 = \u03bb\u2082 for M-SIDH and \u03bb\u2081 = \u03bb\u2082\u207b\u00b9 for FESTA. Similar information is leaked in CSIDH since \u03c6 maps the eigenspaces of Frobenius on E\u2080 to the corresponding eigenspaces on E.\r\n   \r\nIn this paper, we introduce a new polynomial time attack that generalizes the well known \"lollipop\" attack and analyze how it applies to M-SIDH, FESTA and CSIDH. We show that M-SIDH can be broken in polynomial time whenever E\u2080 or E is \ud835\udd3d\u209a-rational, even when the endomorphism rings of E\u2080 and E are unknown.  This can be generalized to the case where the starting (or end) curve is not \ud835\udd3d\u209a-rational, but is connected to its Frobenius conjugate by an isogeny of small degree.\r\n\r\nFor FESTA, where the curve E\u2080 is already \ud835\udd3d\u209a-rational, we obtain a polynomial time attack under the added requirement that at least one of the basis points P, Q spans an eigenspace of Frobenius, of an endomorphism of low degree, or of a composition of both. We note that the current implementation of FESTA does not choose such a basis. Since it is always possible to construct an endomorphism, typically of large degree, with either P, Q an eigenvector, we conclude that FESTA with overstretched parameters is insecure. \r\n\r\nAlthough the information leaked in CSIDH is very similar to FESTA, we show that our attack does not reveal any new information about the secret isogeny, i.e., we only learn that it is \ud835\udd3d\u209a-rational, which is a priori knowledge.\r\n\r\nFinally, we analyze if and how it would be possible to backdoor M-SIDH and FESTA by choosing system parameters that look inconspicuous, but in fact reduce to the special cases above via a secret isogeny chosen by the adversary.",

        "abstract": "The long running time of isogeny-based cryptographic constructions has proved to be a boon in disguise for one particular type of primitive called Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs). VDFs are characterised by sequential function evaluation but an immediate output verification. In order to ensure secure use of VDFs in real-world applications, it is important to determine the fastest implementation. Considering the point of view of an attacker (say with unbounded resources), this paper aims to achieve the fastest possible hardware implementation of isogeny-based VDFs. It is the first work that implements the 2\u1d40-isogeny walk involved in the evaluation step of an isogeny VDF. To meet our goal, we use redundant representations of integers and introduce a new lookup table-based algorithm for modular reduction. We also provide a survey of elliptic curve arithmetic to arrive at the most cost-effective curve computations and propose an improvement of the point doubling algorithm for better parallelism. The evaluation step of a VDF is defined to be sequential, which means that there is limited scope for parallelism. Nevertheless, taking this constraint into account our proposed design targets the highest levels of parallelism possible on an architectural level of an isogeny VDF implementation. We provide detailed analysis of all our arithmetic modules as well as estimates for their critical path delays and area consumption. Our 28nm ASIC design computes a 4\u00b9\u2070\u2070 = 2\u00b2\u2070\u2070-isogeny in 7.1\u03bc s. It is the first high-performance ASIC implementation for evaluation of isogeny VDFs.",

We remove this roadblock by optimizing pairings for highly-composite degrees such as those encountered in CSIDH and SQISign. This makes the general technique viable again: We apply our low-cost pairing to problems of general interest, such as supersingularity verification and finding full-torsion points, and show that we can outperform current methods, in some cases up to four times faster than the state-of-the-art.

        "abstract": "Strategies and their evaluations play important roles in speeding up the computation of large smooth-degree isogenies. The concept of optimal strategies for such computation was introduced by De Feo et al., and virtually all implementations of isogeny-based protocols have adopted this approach, which is provably optimal for single-core platforms. In spite of its inherent sequential nature, several recent works have studied ways of speeding up this isogeny computation by exploiting the rich parallelism available in vectorized and multi-core platforms. One obstacle to taking full advantage of this parallelism, however, is that De Feo et al.'s strategies are not necessarily optimal in multi-core environments. To illustrate how the speed of vectorized and parallel isogeny computation can be improved at the strategy-level, we present two novel software implementations that utilize a state-of-the-art evaluation technique, called precedence-constrained scheduling (PCS), presented by Phalakarn et al., with our proposed strategies crafted for these environments. Our first implementation relies only on the parallelism provided by multi-core processors. The second implementation targets multi-core processors supporting the latest generation of the Intel's Advanced Vector eXtensions (AVX) technology, commonly known as AVX-512IFMA instructions. To better handle the computational concurrency associated with PCS, we equip both implementations with extensive synchronization techniques. Our first implementation outperforms the implementation of Cervantes-Vazquez et al. by yielding up to 14.36% reduction in the execution time, when targeting platforms with two- to four-core processors. Our second implementation, equipped with four cores, achieves up to 34.05% reduction in the execution time compared to the single-core implementation of Cheng et al. of CHES 2022.",

DKGs enable a group of parties to generate a secret and public key pair in a distributed manner so that the secret key is protected from being exposed, even if a certain number of parties are compromised. Robustness further guarantees that the construction of the key pair is always successful, even if malicious parties try to sabotage the computation. In this paper, we construct two efficient robust DKG protocols in the CSIDH setting that work with Shamir secret sharing. Both the proposed protocols are proven to be actively secure in the quantum random oracle model and use an Information Theoretically (IT) secure Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme that is built using bivariate polynomials. As a tool, we construct a new piecewise verifiable proof system for structured public keys, that could be of independent interest. In terms of isogeny computations, our protocols outperform the previously proposed DKG protocols CSI-RAShi and Structured CSI-RAShi. As an instance, using our DKG protocols, 4 parties can sample a PK of size 4kB, for CSI-FiSh and CSI-SharK, respectively, 3.4 and 1.7 times faster than the current alternatives. On the other hand, since we use an IT-secure VSS, the fraction of corrupted parties is limited to less than a third and the communication cost of our schemes scales slightly worse with an increasing number of parties. For a low number of parties, our scheme still outperforms the alternatives in terms of communication.",

As this proof was repeated in a number of works by various authors, multiple pieces of literature are affected by this result. Due to the importance of being able to prove knowledge of an SIDH key (for example, to prevent adaptive attacks), soundness is a vital property. Surprisingly, the problem of proving knowledge of a specific isogeny turns out to be considerably more difficult than was perhaps anticipated. The main results of this paper are a sigma protocol to prove knowledge of a walk of specified length in a supersingular isogeny graph, and a second one to additionally prove that the isogeny maps some torsion points to some other torsion points (as seen in SIDH public keys). Our scheme also avoids the SIDH identification scheme soundness issue raised by Ghantous, Pintore and Veroni. In particular, our protocol provides a non-interactive way of verifying correctness of SIDH public keys, and related statements, as protection against adaptive attacks.\r\n\r\nPost-scriptum: Some months after this work was completed and made public, the SIDH assumption was broken in a series of papers by several authors. Hence, in the standard SIDH setting, some of the statements studied here now have trivial polynomial time non-interactive proofs. Nevertheless our first sigma protocol is unaffected by the attacks, and our second protocol may still be useful in present and future variants of SIDH that escape the attacks.",

        "abstract": "CSI-FiSh is one of the most efficient isogeny-based signature schemes, which is proven to be secure in the Quantum Random Oracle Model (QROM). However, there is a bottleneck in CSI-FiSh in the threshold setting, which is that its public key needs to be generated by using k\u22121 secret keys. This leads to very inefficient threshold key generation protocols and also forces the parties to store k\u22121 secret shares. We present CSI-SharK, a new variant of \\textit{CSI}-FiSh that has more \\textit{Shar}ing-friendly \\textit{K}eys and is as efficient as the original scheme. This is accomplished by modifying the public key of the ID protocol, used in the original CSI-FiSh, to the equal length Structured Public Key (SPK), generated by a \\textit{single} secret key, and then proving that the modified ID protocol and the resulting signature scheme remain secure in the QROM. We translate existing CSI-FiSh-based threshold signatures and Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocols to the CSI-SharK setting. We find that DKG schemes based on CSI-SharK outperform the state-of-the-art actively secure DKG protocols from the literature by a factor of about 3, while also strongly reducing the communication cost between the parties. We also uncover and discuss a flaw in the key generation of the actively secure CSI-FiSh based threshold signature \\textit{Sashimi}, that can prevent parties from signing. Finally, we discuss how (distributed) key generation and signature schemes in the isogeny setting are strongly parallelizable and we show that by using C independent CPU threads, the total runtime of such schemes can basically be reduced by a factor C. As multiple threads are standard in modern CPU architecture, this parallelizability is a strong incentive towards using isogeny-based (distributed) key generation and signature schemes in practical scenarios.",

In this work, we provide novel methods to analyze small key CSIDH, thereby introducing the representation method ---that has been successfully applied for attacking small secret keys in code- and lattice-based schemes--- also to the isogeny-based world.\r\n\r\nWe use the recently introduced Restricted Effective Group Actions (\\mathsf{REGA}) to illustrate the analogy between CSIDH and Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This framework allows us to introduce a \\mathsf{REGA}\\text{\u2212}\\mathsf{DLOG} problem as a level of abstraction to computing isogenies between elliptic curves, analogous to the classic discrete logarithm problem. This in turn allows us to study \\mathsf{REGA}\\text{\u2212}\\mathsf{DLOG} with ternary key spaces such as {\u22121, 0, 1}\u207f, {0,1,2}\u207f and {\u22122,0,2}\u207f, which lead to especially efficient, recently proposed CSIDH instantiations. The best classic attack on these key spaces is a Meet-in-the-Middle algorithm that runs in time 3^{0.5 n}, using also 3^{0.5 n} memory. \r\n\r\nWe first show that \\mathsf{REGA}\\text{\u2212}\\mathsf{DLOG} with ternary key spaces {0,1,2}\u207f or {\u22122,0,2}\u207f can be reduced to the ternary key space {\u22121,0,1}\u207f.\r\n\r\nWe further provide a heuristic time-memory tradeoff for \\mathsf{REGA}\\text{\u2212}\\mathsf{DLOG} with keyspace {\u22121,0,1}\u207f based on Parallel Collision Search with memory requirement M that under standard heuristics runs in time 3^{0.75 n}/M\u2070\u1427\u2075 for all M \u2264 3\u207f^/\u00b2.

Although Shaw and Dutta proposed an isogeny-based IBS scheme with provable security, the security reduction is non-tight. For an IBS scheme with concrete security, the tightness of its security reduction affects the key size and signature size. Hence, it is reasonable to focus on a tight security proof for an isogeny-based IBS scheme. In this paper, we propose an isogeny-based IBS scheme based on the lossy CSI-FiSh signature scheme and give a tight security reduction for this scheme. While the existing isogeny-based IBS has the square-root advantage loss in the security proof, the security proof for our IBS scheme avoids such advantage loss, due to the properties of lossy CSI-FiSh.",

Our disorientation attacks effectively flip the direction of some isogeny steps. We achieve this by faulting a specific subroutine, connected to the Legendre symbol or Elligator computations performed during the evaluation of the group action. These subroutines are present in almost all known CSIDH implementations. Post-processing a set of faulty samples allows us to infer constraints on the secret key. The details are implementation specific, but we show that in many cases, it is possible to recover the full secret key with only a modest number of successful fault injections and modest computational resources.

SIDH is a compact and efficient isogeny-based key exchange, and SIKE, which is the SIDH-based key encapsulation mechanism, remains the NIST PQC Round 4. However, by the brilliant attack provided by Castryck and Decru, the original SIDH is broken in polynomial time (with heuristics). To break the original SIDH, there are three important pieces of information in the public key: information about the endomorphism ring of a starting curve, some image points under a cyclic hidden isogeny, and the degree of the isogeny.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we proposed the new isogeny-based scheme named \\textit{masked-degree SIDH}. This scheme is the variant of SIDH that masks most information about degrees of hidden isogenies, and the first trial against Castryck--Decru attack. The main idea to cover degrees is to use many primes to compute isogenies that allow the degree to be more flexible. Though the size of the prime p for this scheme is slightly larger than that of SIDH, this scheme resists current attacks using degrees of isogenies like the attack of Castryck and Decru. The most effective attack for masked-degree SIDH has O\u0303(p^{1/(8\u0142og\u2082{(\u0142og\u2082{p})})}) time complexity with classical computers and O\u0303(p^{1/(16\u0142og\u2082{(\u0142og\u2082{p})})}) time complexity with quantum computers in our analysis.",

The Residue Number System (RNS) can compensate for that drawback by making computation more efficient via parallelism. However, performing a modular reduction by a large prime which is not part of the RNS base is very expensive. In this paper, we propose a new fast and efficient modular reduction algorithm using RNS. Also, we evaluate our modular reduction method by realizing a cryptoprocessor for isogeny-based SIDH key exchange. On a Xilinx Ultrascale+ FPGA, the proposed cryptoprocessor consumes 151,009 LUTs, 143,171 FFs and 1,056 DSPs. It achieves 250 MHz clock frequency and finishes the key exchange for SIDH in 3.8 and 4.9 ms.",

Most of their security analyses are conducted in the classical random oracle model, leaving their securities in the quantum random oracle model (QROM) as open problems. In this paper, we propose a generic construction of two-message AKE in QROM. It can be regarded as a QROM-secure version of X3LH [Xue et al. ASIACRYPT 2018], a generic AKE based on double-key PKE. We prove that, with some modification, the QROM security of X3LH can be reduced to the one-way security of double-key PKE. Aside from answering open problems on the QROM security of prior AKEs, such as SIAKE [Xu et al. ASIACRYPT 2019] based on supersingular isogeny, 2Kyber-AKE based on Module-LWE, and FSXY,  we propose a new construction, CSIAKE, based on commutative supersingular isogeny. Our framework enjoys the following desirable features. First of all, it supports PKEs with non-perfect correctness. Secondly, the basic building block is compact and only requires one-wayness. Finally, the resulting AKE achieves the security in CK+ model as strong as X3LH, and the transformation overhead is low.",

Isogeny-based cryptography has some similarities to Diffie-Hellman, but lacks some algebraic properties that are needed for discrete-log-based OT protocols. Hence it is not always possible to directly adapt existing protocols to the isogeny setting.\r\n\r\nWe propose the first practical isogeny-based UC-secure oblivious transfer protocol in the presence of malicious adversaries. Our scheme uses the CSIDH framework and does not have an analogue in the Diffie-Hellman setting. The scheme consists of a constant number of isogeny computations.

The currently best-known method combines the reduction of a suitable complex multiplication (CM) j-invariant and a random walk over some supersingular isogeny graph. Unfortunately, this method is not suitable for numerous cryptographic applications because it gives information about the endomorphism ring of the generated curve. This motivates a stricter version of the SRS problem, requiring that the sampling algorithm gives no information about the endomorphism ring of the output curve (cSRS problem).\r\nIn this work we formally define the SRS and cSRS problems, which both enjoy a theoretical interest. We discuss the relevance of the latter also for cryptographic applications, and we provide a self-contained survey of the known approaches to both problems. Those for the cSRS problem work only for small finite fields, have exponential complexity in the characteristic of the base finite field (since they require computing and finding roots of polynomials of large degree), leaving the problem open. In the second part of the paper, we propose and analyse some alternative techniques \u2014 based either on Hasse invariant or division polynomials \u2014 and we explain the reasons why them do not readily lead to efficient cSRS algorithms, but they may open promising research directions.",

In most scenarios, the isogeny is known to be of degree \u2113\u1d49 for some small prime \u2113. We call this problem the Supersingular Fixed-Degree Isogeny Path (SIPFD) problem.\r\nIt is believed that the most general version of SIPFD is not solvable faster than in exponential time by classical as well as quantum attackers. \r\n\r\nIn a classical setting, a meet-in-the-middle algorithm is the fastest known strategy for solving the SIPFD. However, due to its stringent memory requirements, it quickly becomes infeasible for moderately large SIPFD instances. In a practical setting, one has therefore to resort to time-memory trade-offs to instantiate attacks on the SIPFD. This is particularly true for GPU platforms, which are inherently more memory-constrained than CPU architectures. In such a setting, a van Oorschot-Wiener-based collision finding algorithm offers a better asymptotic scaling. Finding the best algorithmic choice for solving instances under a fixed prime size, memory budget and computational platform remains so far an open problem. \r\n\r\nTo answer this question, we present a precise estimation of the costs of both strategies considering most recent algorithmic improvements. As a second main contribution, we substantiate our estimations via optimized software implementations of both algorithms. In this context, we provide the first optimized GPU implementation of the van Oorschot-Wiener approach for solving the SIPFD. Based on practical measurements we extrapolate the running times for solving different-sized instances.

However, in order to attack SIDH-type schemes, one requires a particular isogeny which is usually not returned by the general reduction. At Asiacrypt 2016, Galbraith, Petit, Shani and Ti presented a polynomial-time reduction of the problem of finding the secret isogeny in SIDH to the problem of computing the endomorphism ring of a supersingular elliptic curve. Their method exploits the fact that secret isogenies in SIDH are of degree approximately p\u00b9^/\u00b2. The method does not extend to other SIDH-type schemes, where secret isogenies of larger degree are used and this condition is not fulfilled.\r\n\r\nWe present a more general reduction algorithm that generalises to all SIDH-type schemes. The main idea of our algorithm is to exploit available torsion point images together with the KLPT algorithm to obtain a linear system of equations over a certain residue class ring. We show that this system will have a unique solution that can be lifted to the integers if some mild conditions on the parameters are satisfied. This lift then yields the secret isogeny. One consequence of this work is that the choice of the prime p in B-SIDH is tight.\r\n\r\nFinally, we show that our reduction still applies for SIDH variations deploying recently proposed countermeasures against a series of classical polynomial time attacks against SIDH.",

It is known that a small endomorphism enables polynomial-time path-finding and endomorphism ring computation (Love-Boneh [36]). An endomorphism gives an explicit orientation of a supersingular elliptic curve. In this paper, we use the volcano structure of the oriented supersingular isogeny graph to take ascending/descending/horizontal steps on the graph and deduce path-finding algorithms to an initial curve. Each altitude of the volcano corresponds to a unique quadratic order, called the primitive order. We introduce a new hard problem of computing the primitive order given an arbitrary endomorphism on the curve, and we also provide a sub-exponential quantum algorithm for solving it. In concurrent work (Wesolowski [54]), it was shown that the endomorphism ring problem in the presence of one endomorphism with known primitive order reduces to a vectorization problem, implying path-finding algorithms.

We prove that these two families of problems are closely related through polynomial-time reductions, assuming the generalised Riemann hypothesis.\r\n\r\nWe identify two classes of essentially equivalent problems. The first class corresponds to the problem of computing the endomorphism ring of oriented curves. The security of a large family of cryptosystems (such as CSIDH) reduces to (and sometimes from) this class, for which there are heuristic quantum algorithms running in subexponential time. The second class corresponds to computing the endomorphism ring of orientable curves. The security of essentially all isogeny-based cryptosystems reduces to (and sometimes from) this second class, for which the best known algorithms are still exponential.\r\n\r\nSome of our reductions not only generalise, but also strengthen previously known results. For instance, it was known that in the particular case of curves defined over \\mathbb F\u209a, the security of CSIDH reduces to the endomorphism ring problem in subexponential time. Our reductions imply that the security of CSIDH is actually equivalent to the endomorphism ring problem, under polynomial time reductions (circumventing arguments that proved such reductions unlikely).",

This new representation appears to be opening interesting prospects for isogeny-based cryptography under the hardness of a new computational problem: the SubOrder to Ideal Problem (SOIP). As an application, we introduce pSIDH, a new NIKE based on the suborder representation. Studying new assumption appears to be particularly crucial in the light of the recent attacks against isogeny-based cryptography.\r\n\r\n    In order to manipulate efficiently the suborder representation, we develop several heuristic algorithmic tools to solve norm equations inside a new family of quaternion orders.

        "abstract": "We address three main open problems concerning the use of radical isogenies, as presented by Castryck, Decru and Vercauteren at Asiacrypt 2020, in the computation of long chains of isogenies of fixed, small degree between elliptic curves over finite fields. Firstly, we present an interpolation method for finding radical isogeny formulae in a given degree N, which by-passes the need for factoring division polynomials over large function fields. Using this method, we are able to push the range for which we have formulae at our disposal from N \u2264 13 to N \u2264 37 (where in the range 18 \u2264 N \u2264 37 we have restricted our attention to prime powers). Secondly, using a combination of known techniques and ad-hoc manipulations, we derive optimized versions of these formulae for N \u2264 19, with some instances performing more than twice as fast as their counterparts from 2020. Thirdly, we solve the problem of understanding the correct choice of radical when walking along the surface between supersingular elliptic curves over \ud835\udd3d\u209a with p \u2261 7 \\bmod 8; this is non-trivial for even N and was settled for N = 2 and N = 4 only, in the latter case by Onuki and Moriya at PKC 2022. We give a conjectural statement for all even N and prove it for N \u2264 14. The speed-ups obtained from these techniques are substantial: using 16-isogenies, the computation of long chains of 2-isogenies over 512-bit prime fields can be accelerated by a factor 3, and the previous implementation of CSIDH using radical isogenies can be sped up by about 12%.",

In this work, we revisit the security of two previously proposed natural protocols: the Group Action Hashed ElGamal key encapsulation mechanism (GA-HEG KEM) and the Group Action Hashed Diffie-Hellman non-interactive key-exchange (GA-HDH NIKE) protocol. The latter protocol has already been considered to be used in practical protocols such as Post-Quantum WireGuard (S&P '21) and OPTLS (CCS '20).\r\n\r\nWe prove that active security of the two protocols in the Quantum Random Oracle Model (QROM) inherently relies on very strong variants of the Group Action Strong CDH problem, where the adversary is given arbitrary quantum access to a DDH oracle. That is, quantum accessible Strong CDH assumptions are not only sufficient but also necessary to prove active security of the GA-HEG KEM and the GA-HDH NIKE protocols. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, we propose variants of the protocols with QROM security from the classical Strong CDH assumption, i.e., CDH with classical access to the DDH oracle. Our first variant uses key confirmation and can therefore only be applied in the KEM setting. Our second but considerably less efficient variant is based on the twinning technique by Cash et al.

The majority of work based on an SIDH framework uses elliptic curves in Montgomery form; this includes the original work by Jao, De Feo and Pl\u00fbt and the sate of the art implementation of SIKE. Elliptic curves in twisted Edwards form have also been used due to their efficient elliptic curve arithmetic, and complete Edwards curves have been used for their benefit of providing added security against side channel attacks. As far as we know, elliptic curves in Legendre form have not yet been explored for isogeny-based cryptography. Legendre form has the benefit of a very simple defining equation, and the simplest possible representation of the 2-torsion subgroup. In this work, we develop a new framework for constructing 2\u1d43-isogenies in SIDH using elliptic curves in Legendre form, and in doing so optimize Legendre curve arithmetic and 2-isogeny computations on Legendre curves by avoiding any square root computations. We also describe an open problem which if solved would skip the strategy traversal altogether in SIDH through the Legendre curve framework.",

Our core ingredient is a novel method of rapidly determining whether a polynomial f \u2208 L[X] has any roots in a subfield K \u2282 L, while crucially avoiding expensive root-finding algorithms. In the special case when f=\u03a6_{\u2113,p}(X,j) \u2208 \ud835\udd3d_{p\u00b2}[X], i.e. when f is the \u2113-th modular polynomial evaluated at a supersingular j-invariant, this provides a means of efficiently determining whether there is an \u2113-isogeny connecting the corresponding elliptic curve to a subfield curve. Together with the traditional Delfs-Galbraith walk, inspecting many \u2113-isogenous neighbours in this way allows us to search through a larger proportion of the supersingular set per unit of time. Though the asymptotic O\u0303(p\u00b9^/\u00b2) complexity of our improved algorithm remains unchanged from that of the original Delfs-Galbraith algorithm, our theoretical analysis and practical implementation both show a significant reduction in the runtime of the subfield search. This sheds new light on the concrete hardness of the general supersingular isogeny problem, the foundational problem underlying isogeny-based cryptography.",

To date the most important instantiation of isogeny-based group actions is given by CSIDH. To model the properties more accurately, we extend the framework of cryptographic group actions (Alamati et al., ASIACRYPT 2020) by the ability of computing the quadratic twist of an elliptic curve. This property is always present in the CSIDH setting and turns out to be crucial in the security analysis of our PAKE protocols.\r\nDespite the resemblance, the translation of Diffie-Hellman based PAKE protocols to group actions either does not work with known techniques or is insecure (\"How not to create an isogeny-based PAKE\", Azarderakhsh et al., ACNS 2020). We overcome the difficulties mentioned in previous work by using a \"bit-by-bit\" approach, where each password bit is considered separately.\r\nOur first protocol \\mathsf{X\\text{\u2212}GA\\text{\u2212}PAKE}_\u2113 can be executed in a single round. Both parties need to send two set elements for each password bit in order to prevent offline dictionary attacks. The second protocol \\mathsf{Com\\text{\u2212}GA\\text{\u2212}PAKE}_\u2113 requires only one set element per password bit, but one party has to send a commitment on its message first. We also discuss different optimizations that can be used to reduce the computational cost. We provide comprehensive security proofs for our base protocols and deduce security for the optimized versions.",

The security of the resulting schemes is therefore deduced from that of the base identification protocol.\nIn this paper, we revisit the proofs that have appeared in the literature for the special soundness property of the aforementioned SIDH-based identification protocol. All such proofs consider the same extraction algorithm, which is claimed to always extract the witness for a statement x when given two valid transcripts, with the same commitment and different challenges, relative to x itself. We show that this is not always the case, with some explicit counterexamples. The general argument fails due to some special cycles, which we call collisions, in supersingular isogeny graphs.\nWe provide some theoretical results on their existence, and discuss their impact on the security of the SIDH-based digital signatures.

The importance of communication privacy is being increasingly and widely recognized; therefore, we anticipate that nearly all end-to-end communication will be encrypted via secure sockets layer/transport layer security (SSL/TLS) in the near future. Herein we consider a catch-22 situation, wherein the cache server checks whether content has been cached or not, i.e., the cache server needs to observe it, thereby violating end-to-end encryption. We avoid this catch-22 situation by proposing an encrypted cache system which we call Cache-22. To maximize its deployability, we avoid heavy, advanced cryptographic tools, and instead base our Cache-22 system purely on traditional SSL/TLS communication. It employs tags for searching, and its design concept enables the service provider to decide, e.g., via an authentication process, whether or not a particular user should be allowed to access particular content. We provide a prototype implementation of the proposed system using the color-based cooperative cache proposed by Nakajima et al. (IEICE Trans. 2017) under several ciphersuites containing post-quantum key exchanges in addition to ECDHE (Elliptic Curve-based). We consider NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography round 3 finalists and alternate candidates: lattice-based (Kyber, SABER, NTRU), code-based (BIKE),  and isogeny-based (SIKE). Compared to direct HTTPS communication between a service provider and a user, employing our Cache-22 system has a merit to drastically reduce communications between a cache server and the service provider (approximately 95%) which is effective in a hierarchical network with a cost disparity.",

In stark contrast to the previous tight constructions whose security is solely based on number-theoretic assumptions, our schemes are based on the Learning with Errors (LWE) assumption which is supposed to be post-quantum secure. The security of our scheme is independent of the numbers of users and signing queries, and it is in the non-programmable random oracle model. Our LWE-based scheme is compact namely, its signatures contain only a constant number of lattice vectors.\n\nAt the core of our construction are a new abstraction of the existing lossy identification (ID) schemes using dual-mode commitment schemes and a refinement of the framework by Diemert et al. (PKC 2021) which transforms a lossy ID scheme to a signature using sequential OR proofs. In combination, we obtain a tight generic construction of signatures from dual-mode commitments in the multi-user setting. Improving the work of Diemert et al., our new approach can be instantiated using not only the LWE assumption, but also an isogeny-based assumption. We stress that our LWE-based lossy ID scheme in the intermediate step uses a conceptually different idea than the previous lattice-based ones.\n\nOf independent interest, we formally rule out the possibility that the aforementioned ``ID-to-Signature'' methodology can work tightly using parallel OR proofs. In addition to the results of Fischlin et al. (EUROCRYPT 2020), our impossibility result shows a qualitative difference between both forms of OR proofs in terms of tightness.",

In this paper, we propose radical-isogeny formulas of degrees 3 and 4 on Montgomery curves. Our formulas compute some values determining Montgomery curves, from which one can efficiently recover Montgomery coefficients.

It is based on the group action of an ideal class group of a quadratic imaginary order on a subset of supersingular elliptic curves, and in this sense it can be viewed as a generalization of the popular isogeny based key exchange CSIDH. From an algorithmic standpoint, however, OSIDH is quite different from CSIDH. In a sense, OSIDH uses class groups which are more structured than in CSIDH, creating a potential weakness that was already recognized by Col\u00f2 and Kohel. To circumvent the weakness, they proposed an ingenious way to realize a key exchange by exchanging partial information on how the class group acts in the neighborhood of the public curves, and conjectured that this additional information would not impact security.\n\nIn this work we revisit the security of OSIDH by presenting a new attack, building upon previous work of Onuki. Our attack has exponential complexity, but it practically breaks Col\u00f2 and Kohel's parameters unlike Onuki's attack. We also discuss countermeasures to our attack, and analyze their impact on OSIDH, both from an efficiency and a functionality point of view.",

In cryptography, an IDentification (ID) protocol is a primitive that allows someone's identity to be confirmed. We present an efficient variation of the isogeny-based interactive ID scheme used in the base form of the CSI-FiSh signature [BKV19], which was initially proposed by Couveignes-Rostovtsev-Stolbunov [Cou06, RS06], to support a larger challenge space, and consequently achieve a better soundness error rate in each execution.  To this end, we prolong the public key of the basic ID protocol with some \u2139t{well\u2212formed} elements that are generated by particular factors of the secret key. Due to the need for a well-formed (or structured) public key, the (secret and public) keys are generated by a trusted authority. Our analysis shows that, for a particular security parameter, by extending a public key of size 64 B to 2.1 MB, the prover and verifier of our ID protocol can be more than 14\u00d7 faster than the basic ID protocol which has a binary challenge space, and moreover, the proof in our case will be about 13.5\u00d7 shorter. Using standard techniques, we also turn the presented ID protocol into a signature scheme that is as efficient as the state-of-the-art CSI-FiSh signature, and is existentially unforgeable under chosen message attacks in the (quantum) random oracle model. However, in our signature scheme, a verifier should get the public key of a signer from a trusted authority, which is standard in a wide range of current uses of signatures. Finally, we show how to eliminate the need for a trusted authority in our proposed ID protocol.",

In this attack, a malicious party  manipulates the torsion points in his public key in order to recover an honest party's static secret key, when having access to a key exchange oracle. In 2017, Petit designed a passive attack (which was improved by de Quehen et al. in 2020) that exploits the torsion point  information available in SIDH public key to recover the  secret isogeny when the endomorphism ring of the starting curve is known.\n\nIn this paper, firstly, we generalize the torsion point attacks by de Quehen et al. Secondly, we introduce a new adaptive attack vector on SIDH-type schemes.   Our attack uses the access to a key exchange oracle to recover the action of the secret isogeny on larger subgroups. This leads to an unbalanced SIDH instance for which the secret isogeny can be recovered in polynomial time using the generalized torsion point attacks. Our attack is different from the GPST adaptive attack and constitutes a new cryptanalytic tool for isogeny based cryptography. This result proves that the torsion point attacks are relevant to SIDH parameters in an adaptive attack setting.

The main improvement in these works is that both CSURF and radical isogenies require only one torsion point to initiate a chain of isogenies, in comparison to V\u00e9lu isogenies which require a torsion point per isogeny. Both works were implemented using non-constant-time techniques, however, in a realistic scenario, a constant-time implementation is necessary to mitigate risks of timing attacks. The analysis of constant-time CSURF and radical isogenies was left as an open problem by Castryck, Decru, and Vercauteren.\nIn this work, we analyze this problem. A straightforward constant-time implementation of CSURF and radical isogenies\nencounters too many issues to be cost-effective, but we resolve some of these issues with new optimization techniques. We introduce projective radical isogenies to save costly inversions and present a hybrid strategy for the integration of radical isogenies in CSIDH implementations. These improvements make radical isogenies almost twice as efficient in constant-time, in terms of finite field multiplications. Using these improvements, we then measure the algorithmic performance in a benchmark\nof CSIDH, CSURF and CRADS (an implementation using radical isogenies) for different prime sizes. Our implementation provides a more accurate comparison between CSIDH, CSURF and CRADS than the original benchmarks, by using state-of-the-art techniques for all three implementations. Our experiments illustrate that the speed-up of constant-time CSURF-512 with radical isogenies is reduced to about 3% in comparison to the fastest state-of-the-art constant-time CSIDH-512 implementation. The performance is worse for larger primes, as radical isogenies scale worse than V\u00e9lu isogenies.",

We propose an entirely different approach using succinct non-interactive arguments (SNARGs), but specifically tailored to the arithmetic structure of the isogeny setting to achieve good asymptotic efficiency. We obtain an isogeny-based VDF construction with postquantum security, quasi-logarithmic verification, and requiring no trusted setup.

In this effort, we design especially-tailored hardware accelerators for the time-critical multiplication and isogeny computations that we use to model an ASIC-powered instance of the van Oorschot-Wiener (vOW) parallel collision search algorithm. We then extend the analysis to AES and SHA-3 in the context of the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization process to carry out a parameter analysis based on our cost model. This analysis, together with the state-of-the-art quantum security analysis of SIKE, indicates that the current SIKE parameters offer higher practical security than currently believed, closing an open issue on the suitability of the parameters to match NIST's security levels. In addition, we explore the possibility of using significantly smaller primes to enable more efficient and compact implementations with reduced bandwidth.\nOur improved cost model and analysis can be applied to other cryptographic settings and primitives, and can have implications for other post-quantum candidates in the NIST process.",

G2SIDH is able to achieve the same security as SIDH while using fields a third of the size.\n\nWe analyze the keyspace of G2SIDH and achieve an improvement to the secret selection by using symplectic bases for the torsion subgroups. This allows for the near uniform sampling of secrets without needing to solve multiple linear congruences as suggested by Flynn--Ti. More generally, using symplectic bases enables us to classify and enumerate isogeny kernel subgroups and thus simplify the secret sampling step for general genus-2 SIDH-style constructions.\n\nThe proposed adaptive attack on G2SIDH is able to recover the secret when furnished with an oracle that returns a single bit of information. We ensure that the maliciously generated information provided by the attacker cannot be detected by implementing simple countermeasures, forcing the use of the Fujisaki--Okamoto transform for CCA2-security. We demonstrate this attack and show that it is able to recover the secret isogeny in all cases of G2SIDH using a symplectic basis before extending the strategy to arbitrary bases.",

We focus our assessment on isogeny-based cryptosystems due to their suitability for performing a potentially unbounded number of update operations, a practical requirement for secure messaging where user conversations can occur over months, if not years.\n\nWe begin by formalizing two UPKE variants in the literature as Symmetric and Asymmetric UPKE, which differ in how encryption and decryption keys are updated. We argue that Asymmetric UPKE constructions in the literature cannot be straightforwardly instantiated using SIDH nor CSIDH. We then describe a SIDH construction that partially achieves the required security notions for Symmetric UPKE, but due to existing mathematical limitations, cannot provide fine-grained forward secrecy. Finally, we present a CSIDH Symmetric UPKE construction that requires a parameter set in which the class group structure is fully known.

However, the long latency, caused by the serial large-degree isogeny computation which is dominated by modular multiplications, has made it less competitive than most popular post-quantum candidates. In this paper, we propose a high-speed and low-latency architecture for our recently presented optimized SIKE algorithm. Firstly, we design a new field arithmetic logic unit (FALU) with many algorithmic transformations and architectural optimizations. Especially, for the FALU, an extremely low-latency modular multiplier is devised based on a modified algorithm by fully parallelizing and highly optimizing the small-size multipliers and the reduction submodules. Secondly, we develop a compact control logic and update the instructions based on the benchmark provided in the newest SIKE library, fitting well with our design. Thirdly, an efficient memory access method is proposed by scheduling the input and output of the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) in two identical RAMs, which can significantly reduce the latency. Finally, we code the proposed architectures using the Verilog language and integrate them into the SIKE library. The implementation results on a Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA show that for SIKEp751, our design only costs 9.3 ms with a frequency of 155.8 MHz, about 2x faster than the state-of-the-art, and achieves the best area efficiency among existing works. Particularly, the modular multiplier merely needs 16 clock cycles, reducing the delay by nearly one order of magnitude with a small factor of increase in hardware resource.",

In a digital signature scheme, receiver of a message-signature pair gets assurance about the fact that the message belongs to the sender and neither receiver nor any third party can manipulate the message. In the current state of art, most of the existing digital signatures' security relies on classical cryptographic assumption based hard problems, such as discrete log, integer factorization, etc. However, rapid development of quantum computing creates a security threat to these classical digital signature schemes. It indicates the recruitment of an alternative solution which can prevent quantum attacks. We focus on this concern by implementing a post-quantum secure isogeny based digital signature scheme without making use of SIDH and CSIDH. Our scheme achieves uf-cma security under a hard problem in isogeny. The proposed signature scheme incurs 256 byte public key size and 128 byte signature size to achieve 128-bit security level (NIST-1 level of security). In particular, the size of signature of\nour design is smaller than all other IBC based signature schemes at the 128-bit security level.",

        "abstract": "SIDH is a post-quantum key exchange algorithm based on the presumed difficulty of finding isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves. However, SIDH and related cryptosystems also reveal additional information: the restriction of a secret isogeny to a subgroup of the curve (torsion-point information). Petit [30] was the first to demonstrate that torsion-point information could noticeably lower the difficulty of finding secret isogenies. In particular, Petit showed that \"overstretched\" parameterizations of SIDH could be broken in polynomial time. However, this did not impact the security of any cryptosystems proposed in the literature. The contribution of this paper is twofold: First, we strengthen the techniques of [30] by exploiting additional information coming from a dual and a Frobenius isogeny. This extends the impact of torsion-point attacks considerably. In particular, our techniques yield a classical attack that completely breaks the n-party group key exchange of [2], first introduced as GSIDH in [16], for 6 parties or more, and a quantum attack for 3 parties or more that improves on the best known asymptotic complexity. We also provide a Magma implementation of our attack for 6 parties. We give the full range of parameters for which our attacks apply. Second, we construct SIDH variants designed to be weak against our attacks; this includes backdoor choices of starting curve, as well as backdoor choices of base-field prime. We stress that our results do not degrade the security of, or reveal any weakness in, the NIST submission SIKE [19].",

        "abstract": "Thanks to relatively small public and secret keys, the Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation (SIKE) protocol made it into the third evaluation round of the post-quantum standardization project of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Even though a large body of research has been devoted to the efficient implementation of SIKE, its latency is still undesirably long for many real-world applications. Most existing implementations of the SIKE protocol use the Montgomery representation for the underlying field arithmetic since the corresponding reduction algorithm is considered the fastest method for performing multiple-precision modular reduction. In this paper, we propose a new data representation for supersingular isogeny-based Elliptic-Curve Cryptography (ECC), of which SIKE is a sub-class. This new representation enables significantly faster implementations of modular reduction than the Montgomery reduction, and also other finite-field arithmetic operations used in ECC can benefit from our data representation. We implemented all arithmetic operations in C using the proposed representation such that they have constant execution time and integrated them to the latest version of the SIKE software library. Using four different parameters sets, we benchmarked our design and the optimized generic implementation on a 2.6 GHz Intel Xeon E5-2690 processor. Our results show that, for the prime of SIKEp751, the proposed reduction algorithm is approximately 2.61 times faster than the currently best implementation of Montgomery reduction, and our representation also enables significantly better timings for other finite-field operations. Due to these improvements, we were able to achieve a speed-up by a factor of about 1.65, 2.03, 1.61, and 1.48 for SIKEp751, SIKEp610, SIKEp503, and SIKEp434, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art generic implementations.IKEp751, SIKEp610, SIKEp503, and SIKEp434, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art generic implementations.",

The method is fully deterministic and completely avoids generating N-torsion points. It is based on explicit formulae for the coordinates of an N-torsion point P' on the codomain of a cyclic N-isogeny \u03c6 : E \u2192 E', such that composing \u03c6 with E' \u2192 E' / \u3008 P' \u3009 yields a cyclic N\u00b2-isogeny. These formulae are simple algebraic expressions in the coefficients of E, the coordinates of a generator P of \\ker \u03c6, and an Nth root \u221a[N]{\u03c1}, where the radicand \u03c1 itself is given by an easily computable algebraic expression in the coefficients of E and the coordinates of P. The formulae can be iterated and are particularly useful when computing chains of N-isogenies over a finite field \ud835\udd3d_q with \\gcd(q\u22121, N) = 1, where taking an Nth root is a simple exponentiation. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our method results in an order of magnitude speed-up for N \u2264 13; for larger N, the advantage disappears due to the increasing complexity of the formulae. When applied to CSIDH, we obtain a speed-up of about 19 % over the implementation by Bernstein, De Feo, Leroux and Smith for the CSURF-512 parameters.",

It follows that for any \u2113 \u2208 \u2124 such that a(\u2113) \u2261 b(\u2113) \u2261 0 \\bmod{C}, the two integers a(\u2113)/C and b(\u2113)/C differ by 1 and necessarily contain n factors of roughly the same size.

Our algorithm combines a simple sieve with parametrizations given by a collection of solutions to the PTE problem.\n\nThe motivation for finding large twin smooth integers lies in their application to compact isogeny-based post-quantum protocols. The recent key exchange scheme B-SIDH and the recent digital signature scheme SQISign both require large primes that lie between two smooth integers; finding such a prime can be seen as a special case of finding twin smooth integers under the additional stipulation that their sum is a prime p.\n\nWhen searching for cryptographic parameters with 2\u00b2\u2074\u2070 \u2264 p <2\u00b2\u2075\u2076, an implementation of our sieve found primes p where p+1 and p\u22121 are 2\u00b9\u2075-smooth; the smoothest prior parameters had a similar sized prime for which p\u22121 and p+1 were 2\u00b9\u2079-smooth.

        "abstract": "The optimization of the main key compression bottlenecks of the supersingular isogeny key encapsulation mechanism (SIKE) has been a target of research in the last few years. Significant improvements were introduced in the recent works of Costello et al. and Zanon et al. The combination of the techniques in previous works reduced the running time of binary torsion basis generation in decompression by a factor of 29 compared to previous work. On the other hand, generating such a basis still takes almost a million cycles on an Intel Core i5-6267U Skylake. In this paper, we continue the work of Zanon et al. and introduce a technique that drops the complexity of binary torsion basis generation by a factor log p in the number of underlying field multiplications. In particular, our experimental results show that a basis can be generated in about 1,300 cycles, attaining an improvement by a factor more than 600. Although this result eliminates one of the key compression bottlenecks, many other bottlenecks remain. In addition, we give further improvements for the ternary torsion generation with significant impact on the related decompression procedure. Moreover, a new trade-off between ciphertext sizes vs decapsulation speed and storage is introduced and achieves a 1.7 times faster decapsulation.",

We formally prove the security of IAS against a quantum adversary. We have implemented IAS and our evaluation shows that IAS can be incorporated into current blockchains while requiring \u223c1500 bytes of storage size on-chain and \u223c140 milliseconds for digital signature verification.

This reduces the underlying hardness assumption to a hidden shift problem instance which can be solved in quantum subexponential time.\nWe formulate our attack in a new framework allowing the inversion of one-way functions in quantum subexponential time provided a malleability oracle with respect to some commutative group action.

It is based on the ideal class group action on \ud835\udd3d\u209a-isomorphism classes of Montgomery curves. The original CSIDH algorithm requires a calculation over \ud835\udd3d\u209a by representing points as x-coordinate over Montgomery curves. There is a special coordinate on Edwards curves (the w-coordinate) to calculate group operations and isogenies. If we try to calculate the class group action on Edwards curves by using the w-coordinate in a similar way on Montgomery curves, we have to consider points defined over \ud835\udd3d_{p\u2074}. Therefore, it is not a trivial task to calculate the class group action on Edwards curves with w-coordinates over only \ud835\udd3d\u209a.\n\nIn this paper, we prove some theorems about the properties of Edwards curves. By these theorems, we construct the new CSIDH algorithm on Edwards curves with w-coordinates over \ud835\udd3d\u209a. This algorithm is as fast as (or a little bit faster than) the algorithm proposed by Meyer and Reith.\n\nThis paper is an extend version of [25]. We added the construction of a technique similar to Elligator on Edwards curves. This technique contributes the efficiency of the constant-time CSIDH algorithm. We also added the construction of new formulas to compute isogenies in O\u0303(\u221a{\u2113}) times on Edwards curves. It is based on formulas on Montgomery curves proposed by Bernstein \\textit{et al.} (\u221a{\\vphantom{2}}\u00e9lu's formulas). In our analysis, these formulas on Edwards curves is a little bit faster than those on Montgomery curves.",

Concretely, we present two AKEs based on a double-key PKE in the supersingular isogeny setting secure in the sense of CK\u207a, one of the strongest security models for AKE.  Our contributions are summarised as follows. Firstly, we propose a strong \\textsf{OW\u2212CPA} secure PKE,\n\\mathsf{2PKE_{sidh}}, based on SI-DDH assumption. By applying modified Fujisaki-Okamoto transformation, we obtain a [\\textsf{OW\u2212CCA}, \\textsf{OW\u2212CPA}] secure KEM, \\mathsf{2KEM_{sidh}}. Secondly, we propose a two-pass AKE, \\textsf{SIAKE}\u2082, based on SI-DDH assumption, using \\mathsf{2KEM_{sidh}} as a building block. Thirdly, we present a modified version of \\mathsf{2KEM_{sidh}} that is secure against leakage under the 1-Oracle SI-DH assumption. Using the modified \\mathsf{2KEM_{sidh}} as a building block, we then propose a three-pass AKE, \\textsf{SIAKE}\u2083, based on 1-Oracle SI-DH assumption. Finally, we prove that both \\textsf{SIAKE}\u2082 and \\textsf{SIAKE}\u2083 are CK\u207a secure in the random oracle model and supports arbitrary registration. We also provide an implementation to illustrate the efficiency of our schemes.\nOur schemes compare favourably against existing isogeny-based AKEs. To the best of our knowledge, they are the first of its kind to offer security against arbitrary registration, wPFS, KCI and MEX simultaneously. Regarding efficiency, our schemes outperform existing schemes in terms of bandwidth as well as CPU cycle count.",

OPRFs and verifiable OPRFs have numerous applications, such as private-set-intersection protocols, password-based key-exchange protocols, and defense against denial-of-service attacks. Existing OPRF constructions use RSA-, Diffie-Hellman-, and lattice-type assumptions. The first two are not post-quantum secure.\n\nIn this paper we construct OPRFs and verifiable OPRFs from isogenies. Our main construction uses isogenies of supersingular elliptic curves over \ud835\udd3d_{p\u00b2} and tries to adapt the Diffie-Hellman OPRF to that setting.  However, a recent attack on supersingular-isogeny systems due to Galbraith et al. [ASIACRYPT 2016] makes this approach difficult to secure. To overcome this attack, and to validate the server's response, we develop two new zero-knowledge protocols that convince each party that its peer has sent valid messages. With these protocols in place, we obtain an OPRF in the SIDH setting and prove its security in the UC framework.\n\nOur second construction is an adaptation of the Naor-Reingold PRF to commutative group actions. Combining it with recent constructions of oblivious transfer from isogenies, we obtain an OPRF in the CSIDH setting.",

Since the protocols are similar to the classical Diffie\u2013Hellman, they are vulnerable to the man-in-the-middle attack. A key exchange which is resistant to such an attack is called an authenticated key exchange (AKE), and many isogeny-based AKEs have been proposed. However, the parameter sizes of the existing schemes should be large since they all have relatively large security losses in security proofs. This is partially because the random self-reducibility of isogeny-based decisional problems has not been proved yet.\nIn this paper, we show that the computational problem and the gap problem of CSIDH are random self-reducible. A gap problem is a computational problem given access to the corresponding decision oracle. Moreover, we propose a CSIDH-based AKE with small security loss, following the construction of Cohn-Gordon et al. in CRYPTO 2019, as an application of the random self-reducibility of the gap problem of CSIDH.

Although the isomorphism between a given supersingular curve and its quadratic twist is not defined over GF(p^2) in general, restricting operations to the x-lines of both sets of twists allows all arithmetic to be carried out over GF(p^2) as usual. Furthermore, since supersingular twists always have the same GF(p^2)-rational j-invariant, the SIDH protocol remains unchanged when Alice and Bob are free to work in both sets of twists.\n\nThis framework lifts the restrictions on the shapes of the underlying prime fields originally imposed by Jao and De Feo, and allows a range of new options for instantiating isogeny-based public key cryptography. These include alternatives that exploit Mersenne and Montgomery-friendly primes, as well as the possibility of significantly reducing the size of the primes in the Jao-De Feo construction at no known loss of asymptotic security. For a given target security level, the resulting public keys are smaller than the public keys of all of the key encapsulation schemes currently under consideration in the NIST post-quantum standardisation effort.\n\nThe best known attacks against the instantiations proposed in this paper are the classical path finding algorithm due to Delfs and Galbraith and its quantum adapation due to Biasse, Jao and Sankar; these run in respective time O(p^(1/2)) and O(p^(1/4)), and are essentially memory-free. The upshot is that removing the big-O's and obtaining concrete security estimates is a matter of costing the circuits needed to implement the corresponding isogeny. In contrast to other post-quantum proposals, this makes the security analysis of B-SIDH rather straightforward.\n\nSearches for friendly parameters are used to find several primes that range from 237 to 256 bits, the conjectured security of which are comparable to the 434-bit prime used to target NIST level 1 security in the SIKE proposal. One noteworthy example is a 247-bit prime for which Alice's secret isogeny is 7901-smooth and Bob's secret isogeny is 7621-smooth.",

SiGamal is similar to ElGamal encryption, while C-SiGamal is a compressed version of SiGamal. We prove that SiGamal and C-SiGamal are IND-CPA secure without using hash functions under a new assumption: the P-CSSDDH assumption. This assumption comes from the expectation that no efficient algorithm can distinguish between a random point and a point that is the image of a public point under a hidden isogeny.\n\nNext, we propose a Naor-Reingold type pseudo random function (PRF) based on SiGamal. If the P-CSSDDH assumption and the CSSDDH* assumption, which guarantees the security of  CSIDH that uses a prime p in the setting of SiGamal, hold, then our proposed function is a pseudo random function. Moreover, we estimate that the computational costs of group actions to compute our proposed PRF are about \u221a{\\frac{8T}{3\u03c0}} times that of the group actions in CSIDH, where T is the Hamming weight of the input of the PRF.\n\nFinally, we experimented with group actions in SiGamal and C-SiGamal.

        "abstract": "Modern key exchange protocols are usually based on the Diffie-Hellman (DH) primitive. The beauty of this primitive, among other things, is its potential reusage of key shares: DH shares can be either used a single time or in multiple runs. Since DH-based protocols are insecure against quantum adversaries, alternative solutions have to be found when moving to the post-quantum setting. However, most post-quantum candidates, including schemes based on lattices and even supersingular isogeny DH, are not known to be secure under key reuse. In particular, this means that they cannot be necessarily deployed as an immediate DH substitute in protocols.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce the notion of a split key encapsulation mechanism (split KEM) to translate the desired key-reusability of a DH-based protocol to a KEM-based flow. We provide the relevant security notions of split KEMs and show how the formalism lends itself to lifting Signal's X3DH handshake to the post-quantum KEM setting without additional message flows.\n\nAlthough the proposed framework conceptually solves the raised issues, instantiating it securely from post-quantum assumptions proved to be non-trivial. We give passively secure instantiations from (R)LWE, yet overcoming the above-mentioned insecurities under key reuse in the presence of active adversaries remains an open problem. Approaching one-sided key reuse, we provide a split KEM instantiation that allows such reuse based on the KEM introduced by Kiltz (PKC 2007), which may serve as a post-quantum blueprint if the underlying hardness assumption (gap hashed Diffie-Hellman) holds for the commutative group action of CSIDH (Asiacrypt 2018).\n\nThe intention of this paper hence is to raise awareness of the challenges arising when moving to KEM-based key exchange protocols with key-reusability, and to propose split KEMs as a specific target for instantiation in future research.",

Since the security of SIDH is based on the hardness of the path-finding problem in isogeny graphs, it is important to study those structure. The existence of cycles in isogeny graph is related to the path-finding problem, so we investigate cycles in the graphs used in SIKE. In particular, we focus on SIKEp434 and SIKEp503, which are the parameter sets of SIKE claimed to satisfy the NIST security level 1 and 2, respectively. We show that there are two cycles in the 3-isogeny graph in SIKEp434, and there is no cycles in the other graphs in SIKEp434 and SIKEp503.",

        "abstract": "CSIDH is an isogeny-based post-quantum key establishment protocol proposed in 2018. In this work, we analyze attacking implementations of CSIDH which use dummy isogeny operations using fault injections from a mathematical perspective. We detail an attack by which the private key can be learned by the attacker up to sign with absolute certainty using \u2211 \u2308 \u0142og\u2082(b\u1d62) + 1 \u2309 fault attacks on pairwise distinct group action evaluations under the same private key under ideal conditions using a binary search approach, where b\u20d7 is the bound vector defining the keyspace. As a countermeasure to this attack, we propose randomly mixing the real degree \u2113\u2c7c isogenies together with the dummy ones by means of a binary decision vector. To evaluate the efficacy of this countermeasure, we formulate a probability-based attack on this randomized scheme using a maximum likelihood approach and simulate the attack using 6 bound vectors used in previous CSIDH implementations. We found that the number of attacks required under our model to reach just 1% certainty about the key increased by a factor between 8--12 over the standard approach in the setting of signed private keys and a factor between 28--45 using non-negative private keys, depending on b\u20d7. We derive theoretical upper bounds on the number of attacks required to reach a specified certainty threshold about the key under our model. Based on our data and the minimal additional overhead required, we recommend all future implementations of CSIDH to employ a randomized decision vector approach. Finally since our model assumes fault attacks provide no information on the sign of the key, we use a technique based on Gray codes to optimize the standard meet-in-the-middle attack for learning the sign of the key values once their magnitudes have been learned through fault attacks. We estimate that, on average, this optimized technique uses approximately 88% fewer field-multiplication-equivalent operations over the standard approach.",

In order to be better equipped for different post-quantum scenarios, our architectures were designed to feature high-flexibility by covering all the currently available parameter sets and with support for primes up to 1008 bits. In particular, any of the current SIKE parameters equivalent to the post-quantum security of AES-128/192/256 and SHA3-256 can be selected and run on-the-fly. This security scalability property, together with the small footprint and efficiency of our architectures, makes them ideal for embedded applications in a post-quantum world. In addition, the proposed implementations exhibit regular, constant-time execution, which provides protection against timing and simple side-channel attacks. Our results demonstrate that supersingular isogeny-based primitives such as SIDH and SIKE can indeed be deployed for embedded applications featuring competitive performance.\nFor example, our smallest architecture based on a 128-bit MAC unit takes only 3855 slices, 21 BRAMs and 57 DSPs on a Virtex 7 690T and can perform key generation, encapsulation and decapsulation in 14.2, 24.1 and 25.7 milliseconds for SIKEp434 and in 51.7, 85.4 and 92.1 milliseconds for SIKEp751, respectively.",

They worked with the CSIDH-512 parameters and passed through a new record class group computation. However, as with all standard FS signatures, the security proof is highly non-tight and the concrete parameters are set under the heuristic that the only way to attack the scheme is by finding collisions for a hash function.\nIn this paper, we propose an FS-style signature scheme, called Lossy CSI-FiSh, constructed using the CSIDH-512 parameters and with a security proof based on the \"Lossy Keys\" technique introduced by  Kiltz, Lyubashevsky and Schaffner (Eurocrypt'18). Lossy CSI-FiSh is provably secure under the same assumption which underlies the security of the key exchange protocol CSIDH (Castryck et al. (Asiacrypt'18)) and is almost as efficient as CSI-FiSh. For instance, aiming for small signature size, our scheme is expected to take around \u2248 800ms to sign/verify while producing signatures of size \u2248 280 bytes. This is only twice slower than CSI-FiSh while having similar signature size for the same parameter set.\nAs an additional benefit, our scheme is by construction secure both in the classical and quantum random oracle model.",

It uses the action of an ideal class group on Fp-isomorphic classes of supersingular elliptic curves. In CSIDH, the ideal classes are represented by vectors with integer coefficients. The number of ideal classes represented by these vectors de- termines the security level of CSIDH. Therefore, it is important to investigate the correspondence between the vectors and the ideal classes. Heuristics show that integer vectors in a certain range represent \u201calmost\u201d uniformly all of the ideal classes. However, the precise correspondence between the integer vectors and the ideal classes is still unclear. In this paper, we investigate the correspondence between the ideal classes and the integer vectors and show that the vector (1, . . . , 1) corresponds to an ideal class of order 3. Consequently, the integer vectors in CSIDH have collisions related to this ideal class. Here, we use the word \u201ccollision\u201d in the sense of distinct vectors belonging to the same ideal class, i.e., distinct secret keys that correspond to the same public key in CSIDH. We further propose a new ideal representation in CSIDH that does not include these collisions and give formulae for efficiently computing the action of the new representation.",

We present a number of novel improvements, both to generic instantiations of the vOW algorithm finding collisions in arbitrary functions, and to its instantiation in the context of the supersingular isogeny key encapsulation (SIKE) protocol, that culminate in an improved classical cryptanalysis of the computational supersingular isogeny (CSSI) problem.

Our scheme is the first non-generic quantum-resistant group key agreement protocol, and is more efficient than generic protocols, with near-optimal communication overhead. In addition, our scheme is contributory, which in some settings is a desirable security property: each party applies a function of their own private key to every further transmission. We implement the proposed protocol in portable C for the special case where three parties establish a shared secret. Moreover, we benchmark our software on two generations of Intel processors, highlighting the feasibility and efficiency of using the proposed scheme in practical settings.

        "abstract": "Isogeny-based key establishment protocols are believed to be resistant to quantum cryptanalysis. Two such protocols---supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) and commutative supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman (CSIDH)---are of particular interest because of their extremely small public key sizes compared with other post-quantum candidates. Although SIDH and CSIDH allow us to achieve key establishment against passive adversaries and authenticated key establishment (using generic constructions), there has been little progress in the creation of provably-secure isogeny-based password-authenticated key establishment protocols (PAKEs). This is in stark contrast with the classical setting, where the Diffie-Hellman protocol can be tweaked in a number of straightforward ways to construct PAKEs, such as EKE, SPEKE, PAK (and variants), J-PAKE, and Dragonfly. Although SIDH and CSIDH superficially resemble Diffie-Hellman, it is often difficult or impossible to ``translate'' these Diffie-Hellman-based protocols to the SIDH or CSIDH setting; worse still, even when the construction can be ``translated,'' the resultant protocol may be insecure, even if the Diffie-Hellman based protocol is secure. In particular, a recent paper of Terada and Yoneyama and ProvSec 2019 purports to instantiate encrypted key exchange (EKE) over SIDH and CSIDH; however, there is a subtle problem which leads to an offline dictionary attack on the protocol, rendering it insecure. In this work we present man-in-the-middle and offline dictionary attacks on isogeny-based PAKEs from the literature, and explain why other classical constructions do not ``translate'' securely to the isogeny-based setting.",

We revisit the construction and show that it can be repaired by imposing a simple restriction, which moreover clarifies the security analysis. The runtime of the resulting hash function is dominated by the extraction of 3 square roots for every block of 3 bits of the message, as compared to one square root per bit in the elliptic curve case; however in our setting the extractions can be parallelized and are done in a finite field whose bit size is reduced by a factor 3. Along the way we argue that the full supersingular isogeny graph is the wrong context in which to study higher-dimensional analogues of Charles, Goren and Lauter\u2019s hash function, and advocate the use of the superspecial subgraph, which is the natural framework in which to view Takashima\u2019s  Fp^2-friendly starting curve.",

These parameters are based on the hardness of recovering a hidden isogeny between two elliptic curves, using a quantum subexponential algorithm of Childs, Jao and Soukharev. This algorithm combines two building blocks: first, a quantum algorithm for recovering a hidden shift in a commutative group. Second, a computation in superposition of all isogenies originating from a given curve, which the algorithm calls as a black box.\n\nIn this paper, we give a comprehensive security analysis of CSIDH. Our first step is to revisit three quantum algorithms for the abelian hidden shift problem from the perspective of non-asymptotic cost. There are many possible tradeoffs between the quantum and classical complexities of these algorithms and all of them should be taken into account by security levels. Second, we complete the non-asymptotic study of the black box in the hidden shift algorithm.\n\nThis allows us to show that the parameters proposed by the authors of CSIDH do not meet their expected quantum security.",

In this paper, we propose an improved unconventional-radix finite-field multiplication (IFFM) algorithm which reduces the computational complexity by about 20% compared to previous algorithms. We then devise a new high-speed modular multiplier architecture based on the IFFM. It is shown that the proposed architecture can be extensively pipelined to achieve a very high clock speed due to its complete feedforward scheme, which demonstrates significant advantages over conventional designs. The FPGA implementation results show the proposed multiplier has about 67 times faster throughput than the state-of-the-art designs and more than 12 times better area efficiency than previous works.

In this paper, we study\nCSIDH, which is one of isogeny-based cryptography presented by Castryck et al. in Asiacrypt 2018. In CSIDH, the secret key is taken from an L_\u221e-norm ball of integer vectors and the public key is generated by calculating the action of an ideal class corresponding to a secret key. For faster key exchange, it is important to accelerate the algorithm calculating the action of the ideal class group, many such approaches have been studied recently. Several papers showed that CSIDH becomes more efficient when a secret key space is changed to weighted L_\u221e-norm ball.\nIn this paper, we revisit the approach and try to find an optimal secret key space which minimizes the computational cost of the group action. At first, we obtain an optimal secret key space by analyzing computational cost of CSIDH with respect to the number of operations on \ud835\udd3d\u209a. Since the optimal key space is too complicated to sample a secret key uniformly, we approximate the optimal key space by using L\u2081-norm ball and propose algorithms for uniform sampling with some precomputed table. By experiment with CSIDH-512, we show that the computational cost of the L\u2081-norm ball is reduced by about 20\\% compared to that of the L_\u221e-norm ball, using a precomputed table of 160 Kbytes. The cost is only 1.08 times of the cost of the optimal secret key space. Finally, we also discuss possible sampling algorithms using other norm balls and their efficiency.",

However, most cryptanalytic efforts have treated the hardness of this problem as being equivalent to the more generic supersingular \u2113\u1d49-isogeny problem --- an established hard problem in number theory.\n\nIn this work, we shine some light on the possibility that the combination of two additional pieces of information given in practical SSDDH instances --- the image of the torsion subgroup, and the starting curve's endomorphism ring --- can lead to better attacks cryptosystems relying on this assumption. We show that SIKE/SIDH are secure against our techniques. However, in certain settings, e.g., multi-party protocols, our results may suggest a larger gap between the security of these cryptosystems and the \u2113\u1d49-isogeny problem.\n\nOur analysis relies on the ability to find many endomorphisms on the base curve that have special properties. To the best of our knowledge, this class of endomorphisms has never been studied in the literature. We informally discuss the parameter sets where these endomorphisms should exist. We also present an algorithm which may provide information about additional torsion points under the party's private isogeny, which is of independent interest. Finally, we present a minor variation of the SIKE protocol that avoids exposing a known endomorphism ring.",

Our objective is to give a polynomial-time reduction between the problem of computing the private key in SIDH to the problem of computing any of its bits. The parties in the SIDH protocol work over elliptic curve torsion groups of different order N. Our results depend on the parity of N. Our main result shows that if N is odd, then each of the top and lower O(\u0142og\u0142og N) bits of the private key is as hard to compute, with any noticeable advantage, as the entire key. A similar, but conditional, result holds for each of the middle bits. This condition can be checked, and heuristically holds almost always. The case of even N is a bit more challenging. We give several results, one of which is similar to the result for an odd N, under the assumption that one always succeeds to recover the designated bit. To achieve these results we extend the solution to the chosen-multiplier hidden number problem, for domains of a prime-power order, by studying the Fourier coefficients of single-bit functions over these domains.",

Nevertheless, the considerable computations form the bottleneck and limit its practical applications. The modular multiplication operations occupy a large proportion of the overall computations required by the SIKE protocol. The VLSI implementation of the high-speed modular multiplier remains a big challenge. In this paper, we propose three improved modular multiplication algorithms based on an unconventional radix for this protocol, all of which cost about 20% fewer computations than the prior art. Besides, a multi-precision scheme is also introduced for the proposed algorithms to improve the scalability in hardware implementation, resulting in three new algorithms. We then present very efficient high-speed modular multiplier architectures for the six algorithms. It is shown that these new architectures can be highly optimized and extensively pipelined to obtain high throughput thanks to the adopted overlapping processing scheme. The FPGA implementation results show the proposed multipliers without the multi-precision scheme all achieve about 60 times higher throughput than the state-of-the-art design (the FFM2 multiplier), and those with the multi-precision scheme all acquire almost 10 times higher throughput than this work. Meanwhile, each of the multi-precision based designs has almost the same resource consumptions as the FFM2 does.",

Supersingular isogeny graphs were introduced as a hard problem into cryptography by Charles, Goren, and Lauter for the construction of cryptographic hash functions. These are large expander graphs, and the hard problem is to find an efficient algorithm for routing, or path-finding, between two vertices of the graph. We consider four aspects of supersingular isogeny graphs, study each thoroughly and, where appropriate, discuss how they relate to one another.\n\nFirst, we consider two related graphs that help us understand the structure: the `spine' \ud835\udcae, which is the subgraph of \ud835\udca2_\u2113(\ud835\udd3d\u0305}) given by the j-invariants in \ud835\udd3d\u209a, and the graph \ud835\udca2_\u2113(\ud835\udd3d\u209a), in which both curves and isogenies must be defined over \ud835\udd3d\u209a. We show how to pass from the latter to the former. The graph \ud835\udcae is relevant for cryptanalysis because routing between vertices in \ud835\udd3d\u209a is easier than in the full isogeny graph. The \ud835\udd3d\u209a-vertices are typically assumed to be randomly distributed in the graph, which is far from true. We provide an analysis of the distances of connected components of \ud835\udcae.\n\nNext, we study the involution on \ud835\udca2_\u2113(\ud835\udd3d\u0305}) that is given by the Frobenius of \ud835\udd3d\u209a and give heuristics on how often shortest paths between two conjugate j-invariants are preserved by this involution (mirror paths). We also study the related question of what proportion of conjugate j-invariants are \u2113-isogenous for \u2113 = 2,3. We conclude with experimental data on the diameters of supersingular isogeny graphs when \u2113 = 2 and compare this with previous results on diameters of LPS graphs and random Ramanujan graphs.",

The high speeds in this paper are driven by compact, inversion-free point and isogeny arithmetic and fast SIDH-tailored field arithmetic: on an Intel Haswell processor, generating ephemeral public keys takes 46 million cycles for Alice and 54 million cycles for Bob, while computing the shared secret takes 44 million and 52 million cycles, respectively.

Both operations were impossible before and allow us to instantiate an isogeny based signature scheme first sketched by Stolbunov, which we further optimize using multiple public keys and Merkle trees.  We also show that including quadratic twists allows to cut the public key size in half for free.  Optimizing for signature size, our implementation takes 390ms to sign/verify and results in signatures of 263 bytes, at the expense of a large public key.   This is 300 times faster and over 3 times smaller than an optimized version of SeaSign for the same parameter set.

When compared to other post-quantum algorithms, SIDH appears to be well-suited for the implementation on those constrained devices due to its small key sizes. On the other hand, SIDH is computationally complex, which presumably results in long computation times. Since there are no published results to test this assumption, we present speed-optimized implementations for two small microcontrollers and set a first benchmark that can be of relevance for the standardization process. We use state-of-the art field arithmetic algorithms and optimize them in assembly. However, an ephemeral key exchange still requires more than 18 seconds on a 32-bit Cortex-M4 and more than 11 minutes on a 16-bit MSP430. Those results show that even with an improvement by a factor of 4, SIDH is in-fact impractical for small embedded devices, regardless of further possible improvements in the implementation.

The high performance of our implementations is mainly due to carefully optimized multiprecision and modular arithmetic that finely integrates both ARM and NEON instructions in order to reduce the number of pipeline stalls and memory accesses, and a new Montgomery reduction technique that combines the use of the UMAAL instruction with a variant of the hybrid-scanning approach. In addition, we present efficient implementations of SIDH and SIKE for 64-bit ARMv8-A processors, based on a high-speed Montgomery multiplication that leverages the power of 64-bit instructions. Our experimental results consolidate the practicality of supersingular isogeny-based protocols for many real-world applications. For example, a full key-exchange execution of SIDHp503 is performed in about 176 million cycles on an ARM Cortex-A15 from the ARMv7-A family (i.e., 88 milliseconds @2.0GHz). On an ARM Cortex-A72 from the ARMv8-A family, the same operation can be carried out in about 90 million cycles (i.e., 45 milliseconds @1.992GHz). All our software is protected against timing and cache attacks. The techniques for modular multiplication presented in this work have broad applications to other cryptographic schemes.",

Firstly, we give a systematic overview of techniques to compute efficient arithmetic modulo 2\u02e3p\u02b8\u00b1 1. Our overview shows that in the SIDH setting, where arithmetic over a quadratic extension field is required, the approaches based on Montgomery reduction for such primes of a special shape are to be preferred. Moreover, the outcome of our investigation reveals that there exist moduli which allow even faster implementations.\n\nSecondly, we investigate if it is beneficial to use other curve models to speed-up the elliptic curve scalar multiplication. The use of twisted Edwards curves allows one to search for efficient addition-subtraction chains for fixed scalars while this is not possible with the differential addition law when using Montgomery curves. Our preliminary results show that despite the fact that we found such efficient chains, using twisted Edwards curves does not result in faster scalar multiplication arithmetic in the setting of SIDH.",

        "abstract": "Since its introduction by Jao and De Feo in 2011, the supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) key exchange protocol has positioned itself as a promising candidate for post-quantum cryptography. One salient feature of the SIDH protocol is that it requires exceptionally short key sizes. However, the latency associated to SIDH is higher than the ones reported for other post-quantum cryptosystem proposals. Aiming to accelerate the SIDH runtime performance, we present in this work several algorithmic optimizations targeting both elliptic-curve and field arithmetic operations. We introduce in the context of the SIDH protocol a more efficient approach for calculating the elliptic curve operation P + [k]Q. Our strategy achieves a factor 1.4 speedup compared with the popular variable-three-point ladder algorithm regularly used in the SIDH shared secret phase. Moreover, profiting from pre-computation techniques our algorithm yields a factor 1.7 acceleration for the computation of this operation in the SIDH key generation phase. We also present an optimized evaluation of the point tripling formula, and discuss several algorithmic and implementation techniques that lead to faster field arithmetic computations. A software implementation of the above improvements on an Intel Skylake Core i7-6700 processor gives a factor 1.33 speedup against the state-of-the-art software implementation of the SIDH protocol reported by Costello-Longa-Naehrig in CRYPTO 2016.",

Therefore it was hinted by Costello and Hisil, that by using only Edwards curves for isogeny and curve arithmetic, or a hybrid scheme, that uses Edwards curve arithmetic and switches between the models whenever needed, a speedup in the computation may be gained.\n\nFollowing the latter case, we investigated how to efficiently switch between Montgomery and twisted Edwards curves in SIDH, and how to insert Edwards arithmetic in the current state-of-the-art implementation.\nWe did not gain a speedup compared to the results of Costello, Longa, and Naehrig, but in some cases the performance of Edwards arithmetic is almost equally fast. Thus, we suppose that a hybrid scheme does not improve the performance of SIDH, but still can be interesting for platforms having special hardware acceleration for Edwards curves.

        "abstract": "Supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) is an attractive candidate for post-quantum key exchange, in large part due to its relatively small public key sizes. A recent paper by Azarderakhsh, Jao, Kalach, Koziel and Leonardi showed that the public keys defined in Jao and De Feo's original SIDH scheme can be further compressed by around a factor of two, but reported that the performance penalty in utilizing this compression blew the overall SIDH runtime out by more than an order of magnitude. Given that the runtime of SIDH key exchange is currently its main drawback in relation to its lattice- and code-based post-quantum alternatives, an order of magnitude performance penalty for a factor of two improvement in bandwidth presents a trade-off that is unlikely to favor public-key compression in many scenarios.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a range of new algorithms and techniques that accelerate SIDH public-key compression by more than an order of magnitude, making it roughly as fast as a round of standalone SIDH key exchange, while further reducing the size of the compressed public keys by approximately 12.5%. These improvements enable the practical use of compression, achieving public keys of only 330 bytes for the concrete parameters used to target 128 bits of quantum security and further strengthens SIDH as a promising post-quantum primitive.",

Our first contribution is to give a very powerful active attack on the supersingular isogeny encryption scheme. This attack can only be prevented by using a (relatively expensive) countermeasure. Our second contribution is to show that the security of all schemes of this type depends on the difficulty of computing the endomorphism ring of a supersingular elliptic curve. This result gives significant insight into the difficulty of the isogeny problem that underlies the security of these schemes. Our third contribution is to give a reduction that uses partial knowledge of shared keys to determine an entire shared key. This can be used to retrieve the secret key, given information leaked from a side-channel attack on the key exchange protocol. A corollary of this work is the first bit security result for the supersingular isogeny key exchange: Computing any component of the j-invariant is as hard as computing the whole j-invariant.\n\nOur paper therefore provides an improved understanding of the security of these cryptosystems. We stress that our work does not imply that these systems are insecure, or that they should not be used. However, it highlights that implementations of these schemes will need to take account of the risks associated with various active and side-channel attacks.\n\nThis is the full version of the paper: Steven D.

For curve arithmetic, a uniform differential addition scheme for double point multiplication and constant-time arithmetic were used to protect the private keys from side-channel analysis attacks.

This method of compressing public information can be applied to numerous isogeny-based protocols, such as key exchange, zero-knowledge identification, and public-key encryption. We performed personal computer and ARM implementations of the key exchange with compression and decompression in C and provided timing results, showing the computational cost of key compression and decompression at various security levels. Our results show that isogeny-based cryptosystems achieve by far the smallest possible key sizes among all existing families of post-quantum cryptosystems at practical security levels; e.g. 3073-bit public keys at the quantum 128-bit security level, comparable to (non-quantum) RSA key sizes.",

It has been reported by Diem that the GHS attack fails for elliptic curves C_0 over odd characteristic definition field k_d with prime extension degree d greater than or equal to 11 since g(C) become very large. Therefore, for elliptic curves over k_d with prime extension degree d, it is sufficient to analyze cases of d=2,3,5,7. As a result, a complete list of all elliptic curves C_0/k which possess (2,...,2)-covering C/k of P^1 thus are subjected to the GHS attack with odd characteristic and prime extension degree d is obtained.",

It is therefore important to know which curve C\u2080/k_d is subjected to the GHS attack, especially those whose covering C/k have the smallest genus g(C)=dg(C\u2080), which we called satisfying the isogeny condition.\nUntil now, 4 classes of such curves were found by Th\u00e9riault and 6 classes by Diem.

However, Velu\u2019s formulas only work for elliptic curves specified by a Weierstrass equation. This paper presents formulas similar to Velu\u2019s that can be used to evaluate isogenies on Edwards curves and Huff curves, which are normal forms of elliptic curves that provide an alternative to the traditional Weierstrass form. Our formulas are not simply compositions of Velu\u2019s formulas with mappings to and from Weierstrass form. Our alternate derivation yields efficient formulas for isogenies with lower algebraic complexity than such compositions. In fact, these formulas have lower algebraic complexity than Velu\u2019s formulas on Weierstrass curves.",
