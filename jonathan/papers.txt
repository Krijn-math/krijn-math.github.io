generalized class group actions on oriented elliptic curves with level structure;sarah arpin, wouter castryck, jonathan komada eriksen, gioella lorenzon, frederik vercauteren;2024/1172;<p>We study a large family of generalized class groups of imaginary quadratic orders $O$ and prove that they act freely and (essentially) transitively on the set of primitively $O$-oriented elliptic curves over a field $k$ (assuming this set is non-empty) equipped with appropriate level structure. This extends, in several ways, a recent observation due to Galbraith, Perrin and Voloch for the ray class group. We show that this leads to a reinterpretation of the action of the class group of a suborder $O' \subseteq O$ on the set of $O'$-oriented elliptic curves, discuss several other examples, and briefly comment on the hardness of the corresponding vectorization problems.</p>
finding practical parameters for isogeny-based cryptography;maria corte-real santos, jonathan komada eriksen, michael meyer, francisco rodríguez-henríquez;2024/1150;<p>Isogeny-based schemes often come with special requirements on the field of definition of the involved elliptic curves. For instance, the efficiency of SQIsign, a promising candidate in the NIST signature standardisation process, requires a large power of two and a large smooth integer $T$ to divide $p^2-1$ for its prime parameter $p$.</p><p></p><p>We present two new methods that combine previous techniques for finding suitable primes: sieve-and-boost and XGCD-and-boost. We use these methods to find primes for the NIST submission of SQIsign. Furthermore, we show that our methods are flexible and can be adapted to find suitable parameters for other isogeny-based schemes such as AprèsSQI or POKE. For all three schemes, the parameters we present offer the best performance among all parameters proposed in the literature.</p>
computing orientations from the endomorphism ring of supersingular curves and applications;jonathan komada eriksen, antonin leroux;2024/146;<p>This work introduces several algorithms related to the computation of orientations in endomorphism rings of supersingular elliptic curves. This problem boils down to representing integers by ternary quadratic forms, and it is at the heart of several results regarding the security of oriented-curves in isogeny-based cryptography. </p><p>Our main contribution is to show that there exists efficient algorithms that can solve this problem for quadratic orders of discriminant $n$ up to $O(p^{4/3})$. Our approach improves upon previous results by increasing this bound from $O(p)$ to $O(p^{4/3})$ and removing some heuristics.</p><p>We introduce several variants of our new algorithm and provide a careful analysis of their asymptotic running time (without heuristic when it is possible). The best proven asymptotic complexity of one of our variant is $O(n^{3/4}/p)$ in average. The best heuristic variant has a complexity of $O(p^{1/3})$ for big enough $n$.</p><p>We then introduce several results regarding the computation of ideals between oriented orders. The first application of this is a simplification of the known reduction from vectorization to computing the endomorphism ring, removing the assumption on the factorization of the discriminant. As a second application, we relate the problem of computing fixed-degree isogenies between supersingular curves to the problem of computing orientations in endomorphism rings, and we show that for a large range of degree $d$, our new algorithms improve on the state-of-the-art, and in important special cases, the range of degree $d$ for which there exist a polynomial-time algorithm is increased. In the most special case we consider, when both curves are oriented by a small degree endomorphism, we show heuristically that our techniques allow the computation of isogenies of any degree, assuming they exist.</p>
aprèssqi: extra fast verification for sqisign using extension-field signing;maria corte-real santos, jonathan komada eriksen, michael meyer, krijn reijnders;2023/1559;<p>We optimise the verification of the SQIsign signature scheme. By using field extensions in the signing procedure, we are able to significantly increase the amount of available rational $2$-power torsion in verification, which achieves a significant speed-up. This, moreover, allows several other speed-ups on the level of curve arithmetic. We show that the synergy between these high-level and low-level improvements gives significant improvements, making verification $2.07$ times faster, or up to $3.41$ times when using size-speed trade-offs, compared to the state of the art, without majorly degrading the performance of signing.</p>
finding orientations of supersingular elliptic curves and quaternion orders;sarah arpin, james clements, pierrick dartois, jonathan komada eriksen, péter kutas, benjamin wesolowski;2023/1268;<p>Orientations of supersingular elliptic curves encode the information of an endomorphism of the curve. Computing the full endomorphism ring is a known hard problem, so one might consider how hard it is to find one such orientation. We prove that access to an oracle which tells if an elliptic curve is $\mathfrak{O}$-orientable for a fixed imaginary quadratic order $\mathfrak{O}$ provides non-trivial information towards computing an endomorphism corresponding to the $\mathfrak{O}$-orientation. We provide explicit algorithms and in-depth complexity analysis.</p><p></p><p>    We also consider the question in terms of quaternion algebras. We provide algorithms which compute an embedding of a fixed imaginary quadratic order into a maximal order of the quaternion algebra ramified at $p$ and $\infty$. We provide code implementations in Sagemath which is efficient for finding embeddings of imaginary quadratic orders of discriminants up to $O(p)$, even for cryptographically sized $p$.</p>
deuring for the people: supersingular elliptic curves with prescribed endomorphism ring in general characteristic;jonathan komada eriksen, lorenz panny, jana sotáková, mattia veroni;2023/106;<p>Constructing a supersingular elliptic curve whose endomorphism ring is isomorphic to a given quaternion maximal order (one direction of the Deuring correspondence) is known to be polynomial-time assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis [KLPT14; Wes21], but notoriously daunting in practice when not working over carefully selected base fields.</p><p>In this work, we speed up the computation of the Deuring correspondence in general characteristic, i.e., without assuming any special form of the characteristic. Our algorithm follows the same overall strategy as earlier works, but we add simple (yet effective) optimizations to multiple subroutines to significantly improve the practical performance of the method.</p><p>To demonstrate the impact of our improvements, we show that our implementation achieves highly practical running times even for examples of cryptographic size. One implication of these findings is that cryptographic security reductions based on KLPT-derived algorithms (such as [EHLMP18; Wes22]) have become tighter, and therefore more meaningful in practice.</p><p>Another is the pure bliss of fast(er) computer algebra: We provide a Sage implementation which works for general primes and includes many necessary tools for computational number theorists' and cryptographers' needs when working with endomorphism rings of supersingular elliptic curves. This includes the KLPT algorithm, translation of ideals to isogenies, and finding supersingular elliptic curves with known endomorphism ring for general primes.</p><p>Finally, the Deuring correspondence has recently received increased interest because of its role in the SQISign signature scheme [DeF+20]. We provide a short and self-contained summary of the state-of-the-art algorithms without going into any of the cryptographic intricacies of SQISign.</p>
cryptographic smooth neighbors;giacomo bruno, maria corte-real santos, craig costello, jonathan komada eriksen, michael meyer, michael naehrig, bruno sterner;2022/1439;<p>We revisit the problem of finding two consecutive $B$-smooth integers by giving an optimised implementation of the Conrey-Holmstrom-McLaughlin ``smooth neighbors'' algorithm. While this algorithm is not guaranteed to return the complete set of $B$-smooth neighbors, in practice it returns a very close approximation to the complete set, but does so in a tiny fraction of the time of its exhaustive counterparts. We exploit this algorithm to find record-sized solutions to the pure twin smooth problem. Though these solutions are still not large enough to be cryptographic parameters themselves, we feed them as input into known methods of searching for twins to yield cryptographic parameters that are much smoother than those given in prior works. Our methods seem especially well-suited to finding parameters for the SQISign signature scheme, particularly those that are geared towards high-security levels.</p>
