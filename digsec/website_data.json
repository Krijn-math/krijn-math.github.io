        "abstract": "We say there is a share conversion from a secret sharing scheme $\\Pi$ to another scheme $\\Pi'$ implementing the same access structure if each party can locally apply a deterministic function to their share to transform any valid secret sharing under $\\Pi$ to a valid (but not necessarily random) secret sharing under $\\Pi'$ of the same secret. If such a conversion exists, we say that $\\Pi\\ge\\Pi'$. This notion was introduced by Cramer et al. (TCC'05),  where they particularly proved that for any access structure (AS), any linear secret sharing scheme over a given field $\\mathbb{F}$, has a conversion from a CNF scheme, and is convertible to a DNF scheme.\r\n      In this work, we initiate a systematic study of convertability between secret sharing schemes, and present a number of results with implications to the understanding of the convertibility landscape.\r\n        -  In the context of linear schemes, we present two key theorems  providing necessary conditions for convertibility, proved using linear-algebraic tools. It has several implications, such as the fact that Shamir secret sharing scheme can be neither maximal or minimal. Another implication of it is that for a broad class of access structures, a linear scheme where some party has sufficiently small  share complexity, may not be minimal.\r\n       -  Our second key result is a necessary condition for convertibility to CNF from a broad class of (not necessarily linear) schemes. This result is proved via information-theoretic techniques and implies non-maximality for schemes with share complexity smaller than that of CNF.\r\n      We also provide a condition which is both necessary and sufficient for the existence of a share conversion to some linear scheme. The condition is stated as a system of linear equations, such that a conversion exists iff. a solution to the linear system exists. We note that the impossibility results for linear schemes may be viewed as identifying a subset of contradicting equations in the system.\r\n      Another contribution of our paper, is in defining and studying share conversion for evolving secret sharing schemes. In such a schemes, recently introduced by Komargodski et al. (IEEE ToIT'18), the number of parties is not bounded apriori, and every party receives a share as it arrives, which never changes in the sequel. Our impossibility results have implications to the evolving setting as well. Interestingly, that unlike the standard setting, there is no maximum or minimum in a broad class of evolving schemes, even without any restriction on the share size.\r\n      Finally, we show that, generally, there is no conversion between additive schemes over different fields, however by degrading to statistical security, it may be possible to create convertible schemes.",

        "abstract": "SQIsign is a well-known post-quantum signature scheme due to its small combined signature and public-key size. However, SQIsign suffers from notably long signing times, and verification times are not short either. To improve this, recent research has explored both one-dimensional and two-dimensional variants of SQIsign, each with distinct characteristics. In particular, SQIsign2D's efficient signing and verification times have made it a focal point of recent research. However, the absence of an optimized one-dimensional verification implementation hampers a thorough comparison between these different variants.\r\n\r\nThis work bridges this gap in the literature: we provide a state-of-the-art implementation of one-dimensional SQIsign verification, including novel optimizations. We report a record-breaking one-dimensional SQIsign verification time of 8.55 Mcycles on a Raptor Lake Intel processor, closely matching SQIsign2D on the same processor. For uncompressed signatures, the signature size doubles and we verify in only 5.6 Mcycles. Taking advantage of the inherent parallelism available in isogeny computations, we present 5-core variants that can go as low as 1.3 Mcycles. Furthermore, we present the first implementation that supports both 32-bit and 64-bit processors. It includes optimized assembly code for the Cortex-M4 and has been integrated with the pqm4 project. Our results motivate further research into one-dimensional SQIsign, as it boasts unique features among isogeny-based schemes.",

''basis'') points. For this purpose, so-called Mordell--Weil lattices (up to rank $8$) with large kissing numbers (up to $240$) are employed. In a nutshell, the new approach consists in obtaining more efficiently a considerable number (up to $240$) of certain elementary linear combinations of the ``independent'' points. By scaling the point (re)generation process, it is thus possible to get a significant performance gain. As usual, the resulting curve points can be then regularly used in the main stage of an MSM algorithm to avoid repeating computations. Seemingly, this is the first usage of lattices with large kissing numbers in cryptography, while such lattices have already found numerous applications in other mathematical domains. Without exaggeration, the article results can strongly affect performance of today's real-world elliptic curve cryptography, since MSM is a widespread primitive (often the unique bottleneck) in modern protocols. Moreover, the new (re)generation technique is prone to further improvements by considering Mordell--Weil lattices with even greater kissing numbers.",

Searchable encryption schemes require that ciphertexts do not leak information about keywords.

Full security is defined for the secret key settings since it is known that public key schemes cannot achieve the trapdoor privacy in principle.\r\nIn this paper, we construct a query-bounded fully secure scheme from pseudorandom functions. In addition, we propose three types of efficient (unbounded) fully secure schemes. One of them is based on bilinear groups, and the others are besed on lattices.

        "abstract": "In contemporary times, there are many situations where users need to verify that their information is correctly retained by servers. At the same time, servers need to maintain transparency logs. Many algorithms have been designed to address this problem. For example, Certificate Transparency (CT) helps track certificates issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs), while CONIKS aims to provide key transparency for end users. However, these algorithms often suffer from either high append time or imbalanced inclusion-proof cost and consistency-proof cost. To find an optimal solution, we constructed two different but similar authenticated data structures tailored to two different lookup protocols. We propose ATS (Advanced Transparency System), which uses only linear storage cost to reduce append time and balances the time costs for both servers and users. When addressing the value-lookup problem, this system allows servers to append user information in constant time and enables radical-level inclusion proof and consistency proof. For the key transparency problem, the system requires logarithmic time complexity for the append operation and offers acceptable inclusion proof and consistency proof.",

The recent work by Liu et al. devised a generic AS scheme that can be used for any NP relation---which here we will refer to as universal adaptor signatures scheme, in short UAS---from any one-way function. However, this generic construction depends on the Karp reduction to the Hamiltonian cycle problem, which adds significant overhead and hinders practical applicability.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we present an alternative approach to construct universal adaptor signature schemes relying on the multi-party computation in the head (MPCitH) paradigm. This overcomes the reliance on the costly Karp reduction, while inheriting the core property of the MPCitH---which makes it an invaluable tool in efficient cryptographic protocols---namely, that the construction is black-box with respect to the underlying cryptographic primitive (while it remains non-black-box in the relation being proven). Our framework simplifies the design of UAS and enhances their applicability across a wide range of decentralized applications, such as blockchain and privacy-preserving systems. Our results demonstrate that MPCitH-based UAS schemes offer strong security guarantees while making them a promising tool in the design of real-world cryptographic protocols.",

DeepLLL reorders the basis through deep insertions, yielding much shorter vectors than LLL. DeepLLL was introduced alongside BKZ, however, the latter has received greater attention and has emerged as the state-of-the-art. We first show that LLL-style algorithms work with a designated measure of basis quality and iteratively improves it; specifically, DeepLLL improves a sublattice measure based on the generalised Lov\u00e1sz condition. We then introduce a new generic framework X-GG for lattice reduction algorithms that work with a measure X of basis quality. X-GG globally searches for deep insertions that minimise X in each iteration. We instantiate the framework with two quality measures \u2014 basis potential (Pot) and squared sum (SS) \u2014 both of which have corresponding DeepLLL algorithms. We prove polynomial runtimes for our X-GG algorithms and also prove their output to be X-DeepLLL reduced. Our experiments on non-preprocessed bases show that X-GG produces better quality outputs whilst being much faster than the corresponding DeepLLL algorithms. We also compare SS-GG and the FPLLL implementation of BKZ with LLL-preprocessed bases. In small dimensions (40 to 210), SS-GG is significantly faster than BKZ with block sizes 8 to 12, while simultaneously also providing better output quality in most cases. In higher dimensions (250 and beyond), by varying the threshold $\\delta$ for deep insertion, SS-GG offers new trade-offs between the output quality and runtime. On the one hand, it provides significantly better runtime than BKZ-5 with worse output quality; on the other hand, it is significantly faster than BKZ-21 while providing increasingly better output quality after around dimension 350.",

        "abstract": "Most existing MPC protocols consider the homogeneous setting, where all the MPC players are assumed to have identical communication and computation resources. In practice, the player with the least resources often becomes the bottleneck of the entire MPC protocol execution. In this work, we initiate the study of so-called \\emph{load-balanced MPC} in heterogeneous computing. A load-balanced MPC protocol can adjust the workload of each player accordingly to maximize the overall resource utilization. In particular, we propose new notions called composite circuit and composite garbling scheme, and construct two efficient server-aided protocols with malicious security and semi-honest security, respectively. Our maliciously secure protocol is over 400$\\times$ faster than the authenticated garbling protocol (CCS '17) and up to 4.3$\\times$ faster than the state-of-the-art server-aided MPC protocol of Lu  et al. (TDSC '23); our semi-honest protocol is up to 173$\\times$ faster than the optimized BMR protocol (CCS '16) and is up to 3.8$\\times$ faster than the protocol of Lu et al.",

Despite its strong security profile, MPCitH-based schemes suffer from high computational overhead and large signature sizes, limiting their practical application. \r\n\r\nThis work addresses these inefficiencies by relaxing vector commitments within MPCitH-based schemes. We introduce the concept of vector semi-commitment, which relaxes the binding property of traditional vector commitment. Vector semi-commitment schemes may allow an adversary to find more than one preimage of a commitment. We instantiate vector semi-commitment schemes in both the random oracle model and the ideal cipher model, leveraging recent optimizations on GGM tree such as correlated GGM tree. \r\n\r\nWe apply the ideal-cipher-based vector semi-commitment scheme to the BN++ signature scheme and prove it fully secure in the ideal cipher model. Implementing these improvements in the $\\mathsf{AIMer}$ v2.0 signature scheme, we achieve up to 18% shorter signatures and up to 112% faster signing and verification speeds, setting new benchmarks for MPCitH-based schemes.",

        "abstract": "In the domain of algorithm substitution attacks (ASAs), we initiate work in a new direction, namely to consider such attacks on algorithms that are public, meaning contain no secret-key material. Examples are hash functions, and verification algorithms of signature schemes and non-interactive arguments.  In what we call a PA-SA (Public-Algorithm Substitution Attack), the big-brother adversary replaces the public algorithm $f$ with a subverted algorithm, while retaining a backdoor to the latter. We consider big-brother's goal for the PA-SA to be three-fold: it desires utility (it can break an $f$-using scheme or application), undetectability (outsiders can't detect the substitution) and exclusivity (nobody other than big-brother can exploit the substitution). We start with a general setting in which $f$ is arbitrary, giving strong definitions for the three goals, and then a construction of a PA-SA that we prove meets them. We use this to derive, as applications, PA-SAs on hash functions, signature verification and verification of non-interactive arguments, exhibiting new and effective ways to subvert these. As a further application of the first two, we give a PA-SA on X.509 TLS certificates. While ASAs have been traditionally confined to exfiltrating secret keys, our work shows that they are possible and effective at subverting public functions where there are no keys to exfiltrate. Our constructions serve to help defenders and developers identify potential attacks by illustrating how they might be built.",

A FEP is typically composed of a key exchange protocol to establish shared secret keys, and then a secure channel protocol to encrypt application data; both must avoid revealing to observers that an obfuscated protocol is in use.\r\n\r\nWe formalize the notion of obfuscated key exchange, capturing the requirement that a key exchange protocol's traffic \"looks random\" and that it resists active probing attacks, in addition to ensuring secure session keys and authentication. We show that the Tor network's obfs4 protocol satisfies this definition. We then show how to extend the obfs4 design to defend against stronger censorship attacks and present a quantum-safe obfuscated key exchange protocol.

In this primitive, a client would like to prepare a quantum state (sampled or chosen from a state family) on the server side, such that ideally the client knows its full description, while the server holds and only holds the state itself. In this work we make several contributions on its formulations, constructions and applications. In more detail:\r\n\r\n- We first work on the definitions and abstract properties of the RSPV problem. We select and compare different variants of definitions, and study their basic properties (like composability and amplification).\r\n\r\n- We also study a closely related question of how to certify the server's operations (instead of solely the states). We introduce a new notion named remote operator application with verifiability (ROAV). We compare this notion with related existing definitions, study its abstract properties and leave its concrete constructions for further works.\r\n\r\n- Building on the abstract properties and existing results, we construct a series of new RSPV protocols. Our constructions not only simplify existing results but also cover new state families, for example, states in the form of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle|x_0\\rangle+|1\\rangle|x_1\\rangle)$. All these constructions rely only on the existence of weak NTCF, without additional requirements like the adaptive hardcore bit property.\r\n\r\n- As a further application, we show that the classical verification of quantum computations (CVQC) problem could be constructed from assumptions on group actions. This is achieved by combining our results on RSPV with group-action-based instantiation of weak NTCF, and then with the quantum-gadget-assisted quantum verification protocol.",

We moreover present a novel large-field-to-small-field compiler for polynomial commitment schemes. Using a technique we call \"ring-switching\", our compiler generically bootstraps any multilinear PCS over a large, power-of-two degree extension field into a further PCS over that field's ground field. The resulting small-field PCS lacks embedding overhead, in that its commitment cost is identical to that of the large-field scheme on each input size (measured in bits). We attain concretely small proofs for enormous binary multilinears, shrinking the proofs of Diamond and Posen ('23) by an order of magnitude.",

        "abstract": "HAWK is a lattice-based signature scheme candidate to the fourth call of the NIST's Post-Quantum standardization campaign. Considered as a cousin of Falcon (one of the future NIST post-quantum standards) one can wonder whether HAWK shares the same drawbacks as Falcon in terms of side-channel attacks. Indeed, Falcon signature algorithm and particularly its Gaussian sampler, has shown to be highly vulnerable to power-analysis attacks. Besides, efficiently protecting Falcon's signature algorithm against these attacks seems a very challenging task.\r\n\r\nThis work presents the first power analysis leakage review on HAWK signature scheme: it extensively assesses the vulnerabilities of a central and sensitive brick of the scheme, the discrete Gaussian sampler. Knowing the output x of the sampler for a given signature leads to linear information about the private key of the scheme.\r\n\r\nThis paper includes several demonstrations of simple power analysis attacks targeting this sample x with various attacker strengths, all of them performed on the reference implementation on a ChipWhisperer Lite with STM32F3 target (ARM Cortex M4). We report being able to perform key recoveries with very low (to no) offline resources. As this reference implementation of HAWK is not claimed to be protected against side-channel attacks, the existence of such attacks is not surprising, but they still concretely warn about the use of this unprotected signature on physical devices.\r\n\r\nTo go further, our study proposes a generic way of assessing the performance of a side-channel attack on x even when less information is recovered, in a setting where some protections are implemented or when the attacker has less measurement possibilities. While it is easy to see that x is a sensitive value, quantifying the residual complexity of the key recovery with some knowledge about x (like the parity or the sign of some coefficients) is not straightforward as the underlying hardness assumption is the newly introduced Module-LIP problem. We propose to adapt the existing methodology of leaky LWE estimation tools (Dachman-Soled et al. at Crypto 2020) to exploit the retrieved information and lower down the residual key recovery complexity.\r\n\r\nTo finish, we propose an ad-hoc technique to lower down the leakage on the identified vulnerability points. These modifications prevent our attacks on our platform and come with essentially no cost in terms of performance. It could be seen as a temporary solution and encourages more analysis on proven side-channel protection of HAWK like masking.",

        "abstract": "The Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) scheme is a public key cryptosystem that was submitted to the National Institute of Standards and Technology's competition for the standardization of post-quantum cryptography protocols. The private key in SIDH consists of an isogeny whose degree is a prime power. In July 2022, Castryck and Decru discovered an attack that completely breaks the scheme by recovering Bob's secret key, using isogenies between higher dimensional abelian varieties to interpolate and reconstruct the isogenies comprising the SIDH private key. The original attack applies in theory to any prime power degree, but the implementation accompanying the original attack required one of the SIDH keys involved in a key exchange to have degree equal to a power of $2$. An implementation of the power of $3$ case was published subsequently by Decru and Kunzweiler. However, despite the passage of several years, nobody has published any implementations for prime powers other than $2$ or $3$, and for good reason --- the necessary higher dimensional isogeny computations rapidly become more complicated as the base prime increases. In this paper, we provide for the first time a fully general isogeny interpolation implementation that works for any choice of base prime, and provide timing benchmarks for various combinations of SIDH base prime pairs. We remark that the technique of isogeny interpolation now has constructive applications as well as destructive applications, and that our methods may open the door to increased flexibility in constructing isogeny-based digital signatures and cryptosystems.",

        "abstract": "Bitcoin, while being the most prominent blockchain with the largest market capitalization, suffers from scalability and throughput limitations that impede the development of ecosystem projects like Bitcoin Decentralized Finance (BTCFi). Recent advancements in BitVM propose a promising Layer 2 (L2) solution to enhance Bitcoin's scalability by enabling complex computations off-chain with on-chain verification. However, Bitcoin's constrained programming environment\u2014characterized by its non-Turing-complete Script language lacking loops and recursion, and strict block size limits\u2014makes developing complex applications labor-intensive, error-prone, and necessitates manual partitioning of scripts. Under this complex programming model, subtle mistakes could lead to irreversible damage in a trustless environment like Bitcoin. Ensuring the correctness and security of such programs becomes paramount.\r\n\r\nTo address these challenges, we introduce the first formal verification tool for BitVM implementations. Our approach involves designing a register-based, higher-level domain-specific language (DSL) that abstracts away complex stack operations, allowing developers to reason about program correctness more effectively while preserving the semantics of the original Bitcoin Script. We present a formal computational model capturing the semantics of BitVM execution and Bitcoin Script, providing a foundation for rigorous verification. To efficiently handle large programs and complex constraints arising from unrolled computations that simulate loops, we summarize repetitive \"loop-style\" computations using loop invariant predicates in our DSL. We leverage a counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) procedure to lift low-level Bitcoin Script into our DSL, facilitating efficient verification without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluated on 98 benchmarks from BitVM's SNARK verifier, our tool successfully verifies 94% of cases within seconds, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the security and reliability of BitVM.",

        "abstract": "The succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (SNARK) technique has been extensively utilized in blockchain systems to replace the costly on-chain computation with the verification of a succinct proof. However, most existing applications verify each proof independently, resulting in a heavy load on nodes and high transaction fees for users. Currently, the mainstream proof aggregation schemes are based on a generalized inner product argument, which has a logarithmic proof size and verification cost. To improve the efficiency of verifying multiple proofs, we introduce SnarkFold, a novel SNARK-proof aggregation scheme with constant verification time and proof size. SnarkFold is derived from incrementally verifiable computation (IVC) and is optimized further through the folding scheme. By folding multiple instance-proof pairs, SnarkFold defers the expensive SNARK verification (e.g., elliptic curve pairing) to the final step. Additionally, we propose a generic technique to enhance the verifier's efficiency by delegating instance aggregation tasks to the prover. The verifier only needs a simple preprocessing to check the validity of the delegation. We further introduce folding schemes for Groth16 and Plonk proofs. Experimental results demonstrate that SnarkFold offers significant advantages, with an aggregated Plonk proof size of just $0.5$ KB and the verification time of only $4.5$ ms for aggregating 4096 Plonk proofs.",

While this scheme was previously targeted by\r\nside-channel assisted chosen-ciphertext attacks for key recovery, all these attacks have relied on malformed ciphertexts for key recovery. Thus, all these attacks can be easily prevented by deploying a detection based countermeasures for invalid ciphertexts, and refreshing the secret key upon detection of an invalid ciphertext. This prevents further exposure of the secret key to the attacker and thus serves as an attractive option for protection against prior attacks. Thus, in this work, we present a critical analysis of the detection based countermeasure, and present the first side-channel based chosen-ciphertext attack that attempts to utilize only valid ciphertexts for key recovery, thereby defeating the detection based countermeasure. We propose novel attacks exploiting leakage from the ExpandAndSum and FindPeaks operations within the Reed-Muller decoder for full key recovery with 100% success rate. We show that our attacks are quite robust to noise in the side-channel measurements, and we also present novel extensions of our attack to the shuffling countermeasure on both the ExpandAndSum and FindPeaks operation, which renders the shuffling countermeasure ineffective. Our work therefore shows that low-cost detection based countermeasures can be rendered ineffective, and cannot offer standalone protection against CC-based side-channel attacks. Thus, our work encourages more study towards development of new low-cost countermeasures against CC-based side-channel attacks.",

While most homomorphic encryption schemes offer addition and multiplication over ciphertexts natively, any non-linear functions must be implemented as costly polynomial approximations due to this restricted computational model. Nevertheless, the CGGI cryptosystem is capable of performing arbitrary univariate functions over ciphertexts in the form of lookup tables through the use of programmable bootstrapping. While promising, this procedure can quickly become costly when high degrees of precision are required. To address this challenge, we propose Ripple: a framework that introduces different approximation methodologies based on discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) to decrease the number of entries in homomorphic lookup tables while maintaining high accuracy. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate significant error reduction compared to plain quantization methods across multiple non-linear functions. Notably, Ripple improves runtime performance for several realistic benchmarks, such as logistic regression and cross-correlation, among others.",

Compared to the state-of-the-art scheme with these features (Atapoor et al., Asiacrypt `23), our main improvement lies on the complexity of the ``optimistic'' scenario where the dealer and all but a small number of receivers behave honestly in the sharing phase: in this case, the running time and download complexity (amount of information read) of each honest verifier is polylogarithmic and the total amount of broadcast information by the dealer is logarithmic; all these complexities were linear in the aforementioned work by Atapoor et al. At the same time, we preserve these complexities with respect to the previous work for the ``pessimistic'' case where the dealer or $O(n)$ receivers cheat actively.\r\nThe new VSS protocol is of interest in multiparty computations where each party runs one VSS as a dealer, such as distributed key generation protocols.\r\n\r\nOur main technical handle is a distributed zero-knowledge proof of low degreeness of a polynomial, in the model of Boneh et al. (Crypto `19) where the statement (in this case the evaluations of the witness polynomial) is distributed among several verifiers, each knowing one evaluation. Using folding techniques similar to FRI (Ben-Sasson et al., ICALP `18) we construct such a proof where each verifier receives polylogarithmic information and runs in polylogarithmic time.",

        "abstract": "Service discovery is essential in wireless communications. However, existing service discovery protocols provide no or very limited privacy protection for service providers and clients, and they often leak sensitive information (e.g., service type, client\u2019s identity and mobility pattern), which leads to various network-based attacks (e.g., spoofing, man-in-the-middle, identification and tracking). In this paper, we propose a private service discovery protocol, called PriSrv, which allows a service provider and a client to respectively specify a fine-grained authentication policy that the other party must satisfy before a connection is established. PriSrv consists of a private service broadcast phase and an anonymous mutual authentication phase with bilateral control, where the private information of both parties is hidden beyond the fact that a mutual match to the respective authentication policy occurred. As a core component of PriSrv, we introduce the notion of anonymous credential-based matchmaking encryption (ACME), which exerts dual-layer matching in one step to simultaneously achieve bilateral  flexible policy control, selective attribute disclosure and multi-show unlinkability. As a building block of ACME, we design a fast anonymous credential (FAC) scheme to provide constant size credentials and efficient show/verification mechanisms, which is suitable for privacy-enhanced and highly usable service discovery in wireless networks. We present a concrete PriSrv protocol that is interoperable with popular wireless communication protocols, such as Wi-Fi Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), mDNS, BLE and Airdrop, to offer privacy-enhanced protection. We present formal security proof of our protocol and evaluate its performance on multiple hardware platforms: desktop, laptop, mobile phone and Raspberry Pi. PriSrv accomplishes private discovery and secure connection in less than 0.973 s on the first three platforms, and in less than 2.712 s on Raspberry Pi 4B. We also implement PriSrv into IEEE 802.1X in the real network to demonstrate its practicality.",

In this work we present a thorough security analysis of the Ascon mode: we consider multi-user and possibly nonce-misuse security by default, but more importantly, we particularly investigate the role of the key blinding. More technically, our analysis includes an authenticity study in various attack settings. This analysis includes a description of a security model of authenticity under state recovery, that captures the idea that the mode aims to still guarantee authenticity and security against key recovery even if an inner state is revealed to the adversary in some way, for instance through leakage. We prove that Ascon satisfies this security property, thanks to its unique key blinding technique.",

        "abstract": "Quantum computational advantage refers to an existence of computational tasks that are easy for quantum computing but hard for classical one. Unconditionally showing quantum advantage is beyond our current understanding of complexity theory, and therefore some computational assumptions are needed. Which complexity assumption is necessary and sufficient for quantum advantage? In this paper, we show that inefficient-verifier proofs of quantumness (IV-PoQ) exist if and only if classically-secure one-way puzzles (OWPuzzs) exist. As far as we know, this is the first time that a complete cryptographic characterization of quantum advantage is obtained. IV-PoQ capture various types of quantum advantage previously studied, such as sampling-based quantum advantage and searching-based one. Previous work showed that IV-PoQ can be constructed from OWFs, but a construction of IV-PoQ from weaker assumptions was left open. Our result solves the open problem. OWPuzzs are one of the most fundamental quantum cryptographic primitives implied by many quantum cryptographic primitives weaker than one-way functions (OWFs). The equivalence between IV-PoQ and classically-secure OWPuzzs therefore highlights that if there is no quantum advantage, then these fundamental primitives do not exist. The equivalence also means that quantum advantage is an example of the applications of OWPuzzs. Except for commitments, no application of OWPuzzs was known before. Our result shows that quantum advantage is another application of OWPuzzs, which solves the open question of. Moreover, it is the first quantum-computation-classical-communication (QCCC) application of OWPuzzs.",

These OccPoIs provide information on which areas of the traces are important to the DNN for retrieving the key, enabling evaluators to know where to refine their cryptographic implementation.\r\nAfter obtaining the OccPoIs, we first explore the leakages found in these OccPoIs to understand what the DNN is learning with first-order Correlation Power Analysis (CPA). We show that KGO obtains relevant sample points that have a high correlation with the given leakage model but also acquires sample points that first-order CPA fails to capture.

However, due to the infamous Sybil attack, nominal models are not sufficient to express the trust assumptions in open (i.e., permissionless) settings. Instead, permissionless systems typically operate in a weighted model, where each participant is associated with a weight and the adversary can corrupt a set of parties holding at most a fraction $f_w$ of the total weight.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we suggest a simple way to transform a large class of protocols designed for the nominal model into the weighted model. To this end, we formalize and solve three novel optimization problems, which we collectively call the weight reduction problems, that allow us to map large real weights into small integer weights while preserving the properties necessary for the correctness of the protocols. In all cases, we manage to keep the sum of the integer weights to be at most linear in the number of parties, resulting in extremely efficient protocols for the weighted model. Moreover, we demonstrate that, on weight distributions that emerge in practice, the sum of the integer weights tends to be far from the theoretical worst case and, sometimes, even smaller than the number of participants.\r\n\r\nWhile, for some protocols, our transformation requires an arbitrarily small reduction in resilience (i.e., $f_w = f_n - \\epsilon$), surprisingly, for many important problems, we manage to obtain weighted solutions with the same resilience ($f_w = f_n$) as nominal ones. Notable examples include erasure-coded distributed storage and broadcast protocols, verifiable secret sharing, and asynchronous consensus. Although there are ad-hoc weighted solutions to some of these problems, the protocols yielded by our transformations enjoy all the benefits of nominal solutions, including simplicity, efficiency, and a wider range of possible cryptographic assumptions.",

We generalize this insight into a broader duality principle in quantum computation, wherein manipulating quantum states in one basis is equivalent to extracting their value in a complementary basis. In its most general form, this duality principle states that for a given group, the ability to implement a unitary representation of the group is computationally equivalent to the ability to perform a Fourier subspace extraction from the invariant subspaces corresponding to its irreducible representations.\r\n\r\nBuilding on our duality principle, we present the following applications:\r\n\r\n* Quantum money, which captures quantum states that are verifiable but unclonable, and its stronger variant, quantum lightning, have long resisted constructions based on concrete cryptographic assumptions. While (public-key) quantum money has been constructed from indistinguishability obfuscation (iO)\u2014an assumption widely considered too strong\u2014quantum lightning has not been constructed from any such assumptions, with previous attempts based on assumptions that were later broken. We present the first construction of quantum lightning with a rigorous security proof, grounded in a plausible and well-founded cryptographic assumption. We extend Zhandry's construction from Abelian group actions to non-Abelian group actions, and eliminate Zhandry's reliance on a black-box model for justifying security. Instead, we prove a direct reduction to a computational assumption\u2014the pre-action security of cryptographic group actions. We show how these group actions can be realized with various instantiations, including with the group actions of the symmetric group implicit in the McEliece cryptosystem.\r\n\r\n* We provide an alternative quantum money and lightning construction from one-way homomorphisms, showing that security holds under specific conditions on the homomorphism. Notably, our scheme exhibits the remarkable property that four distinct security notions\u2014quantum lightning security, security against both worst-case cloning and average-case cloning, and security against preparing a specific canonical state\u2014are all equivalent.\r\n\r\n* Quantum fire captures the notion of a samplable distribution on quantum states that are efficiently clonable, but not efficiently telegraphable, meaning they cannot be efficiently encoded as classical information. These states can be spread like fire, provided they are kept alive quantumly and do not decohere.\r\nThe only previously known construction relied on a unitary quantum oracle, whereas we present the first candidate construction of quantum fire in the plain model.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate whether the privacy mechanism of periodically changing the pseudorandom identities of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons is sufficient to ensure privacy.\r\n\r\nWe consider a new natural privacy notion for BLE broadcasting beacons which we call ``Timed-sequence- indistinguishability'' of beacons. This new privacy definition is stronger than the well-known indistinguishability, since it considers not just the advertisements' content, but also the advertisements' broadcasting times which are observable in the physical world. \r\n\r\nWe then prove that beacons with periodically changing pseudorandom identities do not achieve timed-sequence- indistinguishability. We do this by presenting a novel privacy attack against BLE beacons, which we call the ``Timer Manipulation Attack.'' This new time-based privacy attack can be executed by merely inserting or reinserting the beacon's battery at the adversary's chosen time. We performed this attack against an actually deployed beacon.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate the ``Timer Manipulation Attack'' and other attacks associated with periodic signaling, we propose a new countermeasure involving quasi-periodic randomized scheduling of identity changes. We prove that our countermeasure ensures timed-sequence indistinguishability for beacons, thereby enhancing the beacon's privacy. Additionally, we show how to integrate this countermeasure in the attacked system while essentially preserving its feasibility and utility, which is crucial for practical industrial adoption.",

        "abstract": "\\textit{Federated Learning} (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm that allows multiple clients to train models collaboratively without sharing local data. Numerous works have explored security and privacy protection in FL, as well as its integration with blockchain technology. However, existing FL works still face critical issues.  \\romannumeral1) It is difficult to achieving \\textit{poisoning robustness} and \\textit{data privacy} while ensuring high \\textit{model accuracy}. Malicious clients can launch \\textit{poisoning attacks} that degrade the global model. Besides, aggregators can infer private data from the gradients, causing \\textit{privacy leakages}. Existing privacy-preserving poisoning defense FL solutions suffer from decreased model accuracy and high computational overhead. \\romannumeral2) Blockchain-assisted FL records iterative gradient updates on-chain to prevent model tampering, yet existing schemes are not compatible with practical blockchains and incur high costs for maintaining the gradients on-chain. Besides, incentives are overlooked, where unfair reward distribution hinders the sustainable development of the FL community. In this work, we propose FLock, a robust and privacy-preserving FL scheme based on practical blockchain state channels. First, we propose a lightweight secure \\textit{Multi-party Computation} (MPC)-friendly robust aggregation method through quantization, median, and Hamming distance, which could resist poisoning attacks against up to $<50\\%$ malicious clients. Besides, we propose communication-efficient Shamir's secret sharing-based MPC protocols to protect data privacy with high model accuracy. Second, we utilize blockchain off-chain state channels to achieve immutable model records and incentive distribution. FLock achieves cost-effective compatibility with practical cryptocurrency platforms, e.g. Ethereum, along with fair incentives, by merging the secure aggregation into a multi-party state channel. In addition, a pipelined \\textit{Byzantine Fault-Tolerant} (BFT) consensus is integrated where each aggregator can reconstruct the final aggregated results. Lastly, we implement FLock and the evaluation results demonstrate that FLock enhances robustness and privacy, while maintaining efficiency and high model accuracy. Even with 25 aggregators and 100 clients, FLock can complete one secure aggregation for ResNet in $2$ minutes over a WAN. FLock successfully implements secure aggregation with such a large number of aggregators, thereby enhancing the fault tolerance of the aggregation.",

Since the Diffie-Hellman key exchange is not post-quantum secure, it is important to investigate post-quantum alternatives.\r\n\r\nWe analyze the security of the LWE-based NIKE by Ding et al. (ePrint 2012) and Peikert (PQCrypt 2014) in a multi-user setting where the same public key is used to generate shared keys with multiple other users. The Diffie-Hellman key exchange achieves this security notion. The mentioned LWE-based NIKE scheme comes with an inherent correctness error (Guo et al., PKC 2020), and this has significant implications for the multi-user security, necessitating a closer examination.\r\n\r\nSingle-user security generically implies multi-user security when all users generate their keys honestly for NIKE schemes with negligible correctness error. However, the LWE-based NIKE requires a super-polynomial modulus to achieve a negligible correctness error, which makes the scheme less efficient. We show that\r\n  - generically, single-user security does not imply multi-user security when the correctness error is non-negligible, but despite this\r\n  - the LWE-based NIKE with polynomial modulus is multi-user secure for honest users when the number of users is fixed in advance. This result takes advantage of the leakage-resilience properties of LWE.\r\n\r\nWe then turn to a stronger model of multi-user security that allows adversarially generated public keys. For this model, we consider a variant of the LWE-based NIKE where each public key is equipped with a NIZKPoK of the secret key. Adding NIZKPoKs is a standard technique for this stronger model and Hesse et al. (Crypto 2018) showed that this is sufficient to achieve security in the stronger multi-user security model for perfectly correct NIKEs (which the LWE-based NIKE is not). We show that\r\n  - for certain parameters that include all parameters with polynomial modulus, the LWE-based NIKE can be efficiently attacked with adversarially generated public keys, despite the use of NIZKPoKs, but\r\n  - for suitable parameters (that require a super-polynomial modulus), this security notion is achieved by the LWE-based NIKE with NIZKPoKs.\r\nThis stronger security notion has been previously achieved for LWE-based NIKE only in the QROM, while all our results are in the standard model.",

At the same time, fundamental properties of quantum states offer new solutions to data and program security that can require strikingly few quantum resources to exploit, and offer advantages outside of mere computational run time. In this work, we demonstrate such a solution with quantum one-time tokens.\r\n\r\nA quantum one-time token is a quantum state that permits a certain program to be evaluated exactly once. One-time security guarantees, roughly, that the token cannot be used to evaluate the program more than once. We propose a scheme for building quantum one-time tokens for any randomized classical program, which include generative AI models. We prove that the scheme satisfies an interesting definition of one-time security as long as outputs of the classical algorithm have high enough min-entropy, in a black box model.\r\n\r\nImportantly, the classical program being protected does not need to be implemented coherently on a quantum computer. In fact, the size and complexity of the quantum one-time token is independent of the program being protected, and additional quantum resources serve only to increase the security of the protocol. Due to this flexibility in adjusting the security, we believe that our proposal is parsimonious enough to serve as a promising candidate for a near-term useful demonstration of quantum computing in either the NISQ or early fault tolerant regime.",

To our knowledge, there is no work directed towards minimizing the index size. In this paper we introduce a novel technique to directly reduce the index size of any SSE. Our proposed technique generically transforms any secure single keyword SSE into an equivalently functional and secure version with reduced storage requirements, resulting in faster search and reduced communication overhead.

Hence, several candidates in the ongoing additional standardization for quantum secure digital signature (DS) schemes by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) rely on such alternate hard problems. Gaussian Elimination (GE) is a critical component in the signing procedure of these schemes. In this paper, we provide a masking scheme for GE with back substitution to defend against first- and higher-order attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to analyze and propose masking techniques for multivariate- or code-based DS algorithms.\r\nWe propose a masked algorithm for transforming a system of linear equations into row-echelon form. This is realized by introducing techniques for efficiently making leading (pivot) elements one while avoiding costly conversions between Boolean and multiplicative masking at all orders. We also propose a technique for efficient masked back substitution, which eventually enables a secure unmasking of the public output. We evaluate the overhead of our countermeasure for several post-quantum candidates and their different security levels at first-, second-, and third-order, including UOV, MAYO, SNOVA, QR-UOV, and MQ-Sign. Notably, the operational cost of first-, second-, and third-order masked GE is 2.3$\\times$ higher, and the randomness cost is 1.2$\\times$ higher in MAYO compared to UOV for security levels III and V. In contrast, these costs are similar in UOV and MAYO for one version of level I. We also show detailed performance results for masked GE implementations for all three security versions of UOV on the Arm Cortex-M4 and compare them with unmasked results.

The authentication algorithms have no cryptographic guarantees.\r\n  \r\nThis is  frustrating given the research that has developed theoretical tools, known as fuzzy extractors, that enable secure, privacy-preserving biometric authentication with public enrollment data (Dodis et al., SIAM JoC 2008). Unfortunately, fuzzy extractor systems either:\r\n-Make strong independence assumptions, such as:\r\n-- Bits of biometrics are i.i.d. (or that all correlation is pairwise between features (Hine et al., TIFS 2023)), or\r\n-- For an error-correcting code, the nearest codeword and the coset of biometric readings are independent (Zhang, Cui, and Yu, ePrint 2021/1559).\r\n  These assumptions either have not been statistically checked or \r\n  statistical analysis indicates they are false.\r\n- Or use incorrect cryptographic analysis.

Our primary parameters are $42$ bits of security at $45\\%$ true accept rate (TAR).  Our quantitive level of security is as good as the above systems, Simhadri et al's incorrect analysis yields an estimate of $32$ bits, while Zhang et al.'s system on the face estimates $45$ bits (with the independence condition). One can easily incorporate a password, boosting security to $64$ bits.\r\n\r\nIrises used to evaluate TAR and security are class disjoint from those used for training and collecting statistics (the open dataset regime).\r\nThe only statistical assumption made is necessary: the accuracy of min-entropy estimation.",

Previous work has been able to achieve copy-protection for various functionalities only in restricted models: (i) in the bounded collusion setting where k -> k+1 security is achieved for a-priori fixed collusion bound k (in the plain model with the same computational assumptions as ours, by Liu, Liu, Qian, Zhandry), or, (ii) only k -> 2k security is achieved (relative to a structured quantum oracle, by Aaronson).\r\n\r\nIn this work, we give the first unbounded collusion-resistant (i.e. multiple-copy secure) copy-protection schemes, answering the long-standing open question of constructing such schemes, raised by multiple previous works starting with Aaronson (CCC'09). \r\n\r\nMore specifically, we obtain the following results.\r\n- We construct (i) public-key encryption, (ii) public-key functional encryption, (iii) signature and (iv) pseudorandom function schemes whose keys are copy-protected against unbounded collusions in the plain model (i.e. without any idealized oracles), assuming (post-quantum) subexponentially secure iO and LWE. \r\n    \r\n- We show that any unlearnable functionality can be copy-protected against unbounded collusions, relative to a classical oracle. \r\n    \r\n- As a corollary of our results, we rule out the existence of hyperefficient quantum shadow tomography, \r\n* even given non-black-box access to the measurements, assuming subexponentially secure iO and LWE, or,\r\n * unconditionally relative to a quantumly accessible classical oracle, and hence answer an open question by Aaronson (STOC'18). \r\n\r\nWe obtain our results through a novel technique which uses identity-based encryption to construct multiple copy secure copy-protection schemes from 1-copy -> 2-copy secure schemes. We believe our technique is of independent interest.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, we also obtain the following results.\r\n- We define and prove the security of new collusion-resistant monogamy-of-entanglement games for coset states.\r\n - We construct a classical puncturable functional encryption scheme whose master secret key can be punctured at all functions f such that f(m_0) != f(m_1). This might also be of independent interest.",

        "abstract": "Private Set Intersection (PSI) allows two mutually untrusted parties to compute the intersection of their private sets without revealing additional information. In general, PSI operates in a static setting, where the computation is performed only once on the input sets of both parties. Badrinarayanan et al. (\\textit{PoPETs} 2022) initiated the study of Updatable PSI (UPSI), which extends this capability to dynamically updating sets, enabling both parties to securely compute the intersection as their sets are modified while incurring significantly less overhead than re-executing a conventional PSI. However, existing UPSI protocols either do not support arbitrary deletion of elements or incur high computational and communication overhead. In this work, we combine asymmetric PSI with Private Set Union (PSU) to present a novel UPSI protocol. Our UPSI protocol supports arbitrary additions and deletions of elements, offering a flexible approach to update sets. Furthermore, our protocol enjoys extremely low communication overhead, scaling linearly with the size of the update set while remaining independent of the total set size. We implement our protocol and compare it against state-of-the-art conventional PSI and UPSI protocols. Experimental results demonstrate that our UPSI protocol incurs $587\\sim 755 \\times$ less communication overhead than the recently proposed UPSI protocol (\\textit{AsiaCrypt} 2024) that supports arbitrary additions and deletions. Moreover, our UPSI protocol also has a significant advantage in running time, achieving an improvement of two to three orders of magnitude, especially in low-bandwidth environments due to the exceptionally low communication overhead. Specifically, with an input size of $2^{22}$ and the size of the addition/deletion set being $2^{8}$, the existing UPSI protocol requires approximately $1650.45$, $1789.5$, and $3458.1$ seconds at bandwidths of $200$ Mbps, $50$ Mbps, and $5$ Mbps, respectively, whereas our UPSI protocol only requires around $3.16$, $3.35$, and $5.65$ seconds under the same conditions.

        "abstract": "Authenticated encryption (AE) is a cryptographic mechanism that allows communicating parties to protect the confidentiality and integrity of messages exchanged over a public channel, provided they share a secret key. In this work, we present new AE schemes leveraging the SHA-3 standard functions SHAKE128 and SHAKE256, offering 128 and 256 bits of security strength, respectively, and their \u201cTurbo\u201d counterparts. They support session-based communication, where a ciphertext authenticates the sequence of messages since the start of the session. The chaining in the session allows decryption in segments, avoiding the need to buffer the entire deciphered cryptogram between decryption and validation. And, thanks to the collision resistance of (Turbo)SHAKE, they provide so-called CMT-4 committing security, meaning that they provide strong guarantees that a ciphertext uniquely binds to the key, plaintext and associated data. The AE schemes we propose have the unique combination of advantages that 1) their security is based on the security claim of SHAKE, that has received a large amount of public scrutiny, that 2) they make use of the standard KECCAK-p permutation that not only receives more and more dedicated hardware support, but also allows\r\ncompetitive software-only implementations thanks to the TurboSHAKE instances, and that 3) they do not suffer from a 64-bit birthday bound like most AES-based schemes.",

To ensure transaction privacy, zkMarket is built upon an anonymous transfer protocol.

Furthermore, by encrypting the decryption key, we make the data registration process more concise and improve the seller's proving time by leveraging commit-and-prove SNARK (CP-SNARK) and our novel pseudorandom generator, the matrix-formed PRG (MatPRG).\r\n\r\nOur evaluation demonstrates that zkMarket significantly reduces the computational overhead associated with traditional blockchain solutions while maintaining robust security and privacy.

This is the first IBE scheme that is (asymptotically) as compact as the most practical NTRU-based schemes and tightly secure under the module learning with errors (MLWE) assumption, known as the standard lattice assumption, in the (quantum) random oracle model. In particular, our IBE scheme is the most compact lattice-based scheme (except for NTRU-based schemes). We design our IBE scheme by instantiating the framework of Gentry, Peikert, and Vaikuntanathan (STOC`08) using the compact trapdoor proposed by Yu, Jia, and Wang (CRYPTO'23). The tightness of our IBE scheme is achieved by extending the proof technique of Katsumata et al. (ASIACRYPT'18, JoC'21) to the hermit normal form setting. To achieve this, we developed some new results on module lattices that may be of independent interest.",

        "abstract": "A major challenge of any asynchronous MPC protocol is the need to reach an agreement on the set of private inputs to be used as input for the MPC functionality. Ben-Or, Canetti and Goldreich call this problem Agreement on a Core Set (ACS) and solve it by running $n$ parallel instances of asynchronous binary Byzantine agreements. To the best of our knowledge, all results in the perfect and statistical security setting used this same paradigm for solving ACS. Using all known asynchronous binary Byzantine agreement protocols, this type of ACS has $\\Omega(\\log n)$ expected round complexity, which results in such a bound on the round complexity of asynchronous MPC protocols as well (even for constant depth circuits).\r\n\r\nWe provide a new solution for Agreement on a Core Set that runs in expected $O(1)$ rounds. Our perfectly secure variant is optimally resilient ($t<n/4$) and requires just $O(n^4\\log n)$ expected communication complexity. We show a similar result with statistical security for $t<n/3$. Our ACS is based on a new notion of Asynchronously Validated Asynchronous Byzantine Agreement (AVABA) and new information-theoretic analogs to techniques used in the authenticated model. Along the way, we also construct a new perfectly secure packed asynchronous verifiable secret sharing (AVSS) protocol with just $O(n^3\\log n)$ communication complexity, improving the state of the art by a factor of $O(n)$. This leads to a more efficient asynchronous MPC that matches the state-of-the-art synchronous MPC.",
