finding practical parameters for isogeny-based cryptography;maria corte-real santos, jonathan komada eriksen, michael meyer, francisco rodríguez-henríquez;2024/1150;<p>Isogeny-based schemes often come with special requirements on the field of definition of the involved elliptic curves. For instance, the efficiency of SQIsign, a promising candidate in the NIST signature standardisation process, requires a large power of two and a large smooth integer $T$ to divide $p^2-1$ for its prime parameter $p$.</p><p></p><p>We present two new methods that combine previous techniques for finding suitable primes: sieve-and-boost and XGCD-and-boost. We use these methods to find primes for the NIST submission of SQIsign. Furthermore, we show that our methods are flexible and can be adapted to find suitable parameters for other isogeny-based schemes such as AprèsSQI or POKE. For all three schemes, the parameters we present offer the best performance among all parameters proposed in the literature.</p>
return of the kummer: a toolbox for genus-2 cryptography;maria corte-real santos, krijn reijnders;2024/948;<p>This work expands the machinery we have for isogeny-based cryptography in genus 2 by developing a toolbox of several essential algorithms for Kummer surfaces, the dimension-2 analogue of $x$-only arithmetic on elliptic curves. Kummer surfaces have been suggested in hyper-elliptic curve cryptography since at least the 1980s and recently these surfaces have reappeared to efficiently compute $(2,2)$-isogenies. We construct several essential analogues of techniques used in one-dimensional isogeny-based cryptography, such as pairings, deterministic point sampling and point compression and give an overview of $(2,2)$-isogenies on Kummer surfaces. We furthermore show how Scholten's construction can be used to transform isogeny-based cryptography over elliptic curves over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ into protocols over Kummer surfaces over $\mathbb{F}_{p}$</p><p></p><p>As an example of this approach, we demonstrate that SQIsign verification can be performed completely on Kummer surfaces, and, therefore, that one-dimensional SQIsign verification can be viewed as a two-dimensional isogeny between products of elliptic curves. Curiously, the isogeny is then defined over $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ rather than $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$. Contrary to expectation, the cost of SQIsign verification using Kummer surfaces does not explode: verification costs only 1.5$\times$ more in terms of finite field operations than the SQIsign variant AprèsSQI, optimised for fast verification. Furthermore, it is plausible that arithmetic on Kummer surfaces can be efficiently vectorised, giving Kummer-based protocols over $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ a potential performance boost on modern architectures, possibly surpassing the performance of elliptic-curve analogues over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$</p>
on cycles of pairing-friendly abelian varieties;maria corte-real santos, craig costello, michael naehrig;2024/869;<p>One of the most promising avenues for realizing scalable proof systems relies on the existence of 2-cycles of pairing-friendly elliptic curves. Such a cycle consists of two elliptic curves E/GF(p) and E'/GF(q) that both have a low embedding degree and also satisfy q = #E and p = #E'. These constraints turn out to be rather restrictive; in the decade that has passed since 2-cycles were first proposed for use in proof systems, no new constructions of 2-cycles have been found.</p><p></p><p>In this paper, we generalize the notion of cycles of pairing-friendly elliptic curves to study cycles of pairing-friendly abelian varieties, with a view towards realizing more efficient pairing-based SNARKs. We show that considering abelian varieties of dimension larger than 1 unlocks a number of interesting possibilities for finding pairing-friendly cycles, and we give several new constructions that can be instantiated at any security level.</p>
efficient (3,3)-isogenies on fast kummer surfaces;maria corte-real santos, craig costello, benjamin smith;2024/144;<p>We give an alternative derivation of (N,N)-isogenies between fast Kummer surfaces which complements existing works based on the theory of theta functions. We use this framework to produce explicit formulae for the case of N = 3, and show that the resulting algorithms are more efficient than all prior (3,3)-isogeny algorithms.</p>
aprèssqi: extra fast verification for sqisign using extension-field signing;maria corte-real santos, jonathan komada eriksen, michael meyer, krijn reijnders;2023/1559;<p>We optimise the verification of the SQIsign signature scheme. By using field extensions in the signing procedure, we are able to significantly increase the amount of available rational $2$-power torsion in verification, which achieves a significant speed-up. This, moreover, allows several other speed-ups on the level of curve arithmetic. We show that the synergy between these high-level and low-level improvements gives significant improvements, making verification $2.07$ times faster, or up to $3.41$ times when using size-speed trade-offs, compared to the state of the art, without majorly degrading the performance of signing.</p>
an algorithm for efficient detection of $(n,n)$-splittings and its application to the isogeny problem in dimension 2;maria corte-real santos, craig costello, sam frengley;2022/1736;<p>We develop an efficient algorithm to detect whether a superspecial genus 2 Jacobian is optimally $(N, N)$-split for each integer $N \leq 11$. Incorporating this algorithm into the best-known attack against the superspecial isogeny problem in dimension 2 gives rise to significant cryptanalytic improvements. Our implementation shows that when the underlying prime $p$ is 100 bits, the attack is sped up by a factor $25{\tt x}$; when the underlying prime is 200 bits, the attack is sped up by a factor $42{\tt x}$; and, when the underlying prime is 1000 bits, the attack is sped up by a factor $160{\tt x}$.</p>
cryptographic smooth neighbors;giacomo bruno, maria corte-real santos, craig costello, jonathan komada eriksen, michael meyer, michael naehrig, bruno sterner;2022/1439;<p>We revisit the problem of finding two consecutive $B$-smooth integers by giving an optimised implementation of the Conrey-Holmstrom-McLaughlin ``smooth neighbors'' algorithm. While this algorithm is not guaranteed to return the complete set of $B$-smooth neighbors, in practice it returns a very close approximation to the complete set, but does so in a tiny fraction of the time of its exhaustive counterparts. We exploit this algorithm to find record-sized solutions to the pure twin smooth problem. Though these solutions are still not large enough to be cryptographic parameters themselves, we feed them as input into known methods of searching for twins to yield cryptographic parameters that are much smoother than those given in prior works. Our methods seem especially well-suited to finding parameters for the SQISign signature scheme, particularly those that are geared towards high-security levels.</p>
accelerating the delfs-galbraith algorithm with fast subfield root detection;maria corte-real santos, craig costello, jia shi;2021/1488;<p>We give a new algorithm for finding an isogeny from a given supersingular elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ to a subfield elliptic curve $E'/\mathbb{F}_p$, which is the bottleneck step of the Delfs-Galbraith algorithm for the general supersingular isogeny problem. Our core ingredient is a novel method of rapidly determining whether a polynomial $f \in L[X]$ has any roots in a subfield $K \subset L$, while crucially avoiding expensive root-finding algorithms. In the special case when $f=\Phi_{\ell,p}(X,j) \in \mathbb{F}_{p^2}[X]$, i.e. when $f$ is the $\ell$-th modular polynomial evaluated at a supersingular $j$-invariant, this provides a means of efficiently determining whether there is an $\ell$-isogeny connecting the corresponding elliptic curve to a subfield curve. Together with the traditional Delfs-Galbraith walk, inspecting many $\ell$-isogenous neighbours in this way allows us to search through a larger proportion of the supersingular set per unit of time. Though the asymptotic $\tilde{O}(p^{1/2})$ complexity of our improved algorithm remains unchanged from that of the original Delfs-Galbraith algorithm, our theoretical analysis and practical implementation both show a significant reduction in the runtime of the subfield search. This sheds new light on the concrete hardness of the general supersingular isogeny problem, the foundational problem underlying isogeny-based cryptography.</p>
